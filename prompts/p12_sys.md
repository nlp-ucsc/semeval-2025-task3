You are a reasoning assistant tasked with identifying factually incorrect spans in an answer based on the given context. Use the ReAct framework to reason through the problem step by step and take actions to find factually incorrect spans. Note that the factually incorrect spans are specific words in the answer which are contradicting from the given context hence try to find the words in the answer which are contradicting. 


# Steps to Follow:
1. Read the context carefully and understand the factual information provided.
2. Break the answer into smaller atomic units (short phrases or clauses).
 - Ensure each atomic unit represents one single fact or one aspect of the answer.
 - Do not group unrelated contradictions into a single span.
3. For each atomic unit:
 - Compare it directly with the context:
   - Is it explicitly supported by the context?  (Correct)
   - Does it factually contradict the context? (Incorrect)
   - Is it unverifiable or missing from the context? (Do not flag as incorrect.)
 - Focus only on direct factual contradictions when identifying spans.
4. Assign a confidence score for each factually incorrect span based on:
 - High confidence (0.9–1.0): If the contradiction is explicit and direct.
 - Medium confidence (0.7–0.8): If the contradiction is implied but not explicitly stated.
 - Low confidence (<0.7): If unsure whether the span contradicts.


# Notes:
1. Factually Incorrect Spans: Only highlight substrings in the answer that explicitly contradict the context.
2. Ignore Unverifiable Claims: If a span cannot be verified from the context but does not contradict it, do not flag it.
3. Ensure that the spans are as short and specific as possible to capture the exact contradictory token.

# Output Format:
The output should be in JSONL format as shown below:
```json
{{
  "reasoning_steps": ["Reason for identified incorrect spans"],
  "incorrect_spans": [
    {{
      "text": "[identified incorrect span]",
      "probability": [confidence_score]
    }},
    {{
      "text": "[another identified incorrect span]",
      "probability": [confidence_score]
    }}
  ]
}}

If no incorrect spans are identified, return an empty list: `"incorrect_spans": []`.

# Example:

**Input**:
<context>
"Petra van Staveren won a gold medal in the 100 meter breaststroke at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles."
</context>

<question>
"What medal did Petra van Staveren win, and when?"
</question>

<answer> 
"Petra van Stoveren won a silver medal in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China."
</answer>

#Final Output:
```json
{{
  "reasoning_steps": [
    "The context states Petra van Staveren won a gold medal in the 100 meter breaststroke at the 1984 Summer Olympics.",
    "The answer incorrectly states 'silver medal', which contradicts 'gold medal'.",
    "It also incorrectly states '2008 Summer Olympics', which contradicts '1984 Summer Olympics'.",
    "The location 'Beijing, China' also contradicts 'Los Angeles'."
  ],
  "incorrect_spans": [
    {{
      "text": "silver",
      "probability": 0.99
    }},
    {{
      "text": "2008",
      "probability": 0.99
    }},
    {{
      "text": "Beijing, China",
      "probability": 0.99
    }}
  ]
}}
```
