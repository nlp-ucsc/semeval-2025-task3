The Germanic tribes grouped under the term "Alemanni" were primarily confederations of various tribes that coalesced into a larger entity during the Roman Iron Age and Early Medieval periods. The Alemanni originated from the coalescence of several smaller Germanic tribes. While the exact composition can be unclear due to evolving alliances and migrations, some of the prominent tribes associated with the Alemanni include:

1. **Suebi**: Often considered the core group of the Alemanni, the Suebi were a significant Germanic tribe known for their distinct cultural and militaristic traditions.

2. **Nicolates**: Mentioned in early sources, this tribe might have been part of the Alemannic confederation.

3. **Lentienses**: Another tribe that likely formed part of the Alemanni, perhaps settling in areas that are now part of modern Germany.

4. **Rugienses**: Some scholars suggest that this tribe may have been included within the Alemannic confederation at certain points.

5. **Juthungi**: This tribe was known to have had interactions, both collaborative and conflictual, with the Alemanni, and might have been part of their alliance at times.

6. **Gambrivii**: Another tribe that might have been absorbed into the Alemanni during their expansion phase.

7. **Semnones**: Although often associated with the Suebi, the Semnones were another powerful tribe that might have had connections with the Alemanni.

The Alemanni were not a single monolithic tribe but rather a confederation of several Germanic groups. They played a significant role in history, particularly in their interactions with the Roman Empire, including invasions and settlements along the Rhine and Danube borders. Over time, the Alemanni established duchies that would later influence the medieval political landscape, particularly in regions like modern-day Germany and Switzerland.
