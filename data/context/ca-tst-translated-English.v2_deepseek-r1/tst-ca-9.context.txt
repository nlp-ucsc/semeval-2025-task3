Theano, also known as Theano of Crotone, is often associated with the Pythagorean school of thought. She was a philosopher and mathematician and is believed to have been a student or follower of Pythagoras, the founder of the Pythagorean school. The Pythagoreans were known for their contributions to mathematics, philosophy, and music theory, and they operated more like a religious or philosophical community rather than a traditional school in the modern sense.

Theano is particularly noted for being one of the few female philosophers of the ancient world and for her probable role in the Pythagorean community. It is said that after Pythagoras's death, she helped to carry on his teachings and may have even led the school for a period, along with her daughter, Damo, and her son, Telauges.

It's worth noting that while Theano's exact contributions are not as well-documented as those of her more famous contemporaries, her association with the Pythagorean school is widely recognized in historical accounts.
