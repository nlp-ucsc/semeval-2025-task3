The Nobel Prize in Physics for the year 1994 was awarded to Bertram N. Brockhouse and Clifford G. Shull. They were recognized for their pioneering work in neutron scattering techniques, which have been instrumental in studying the properties of matter. Bertram Brockhouse was honored for developing neutron spectroscopy, a method that measures the energies of neutrons scattered by atoms in solids and liquids. Clifford Shull received the award for his development of neutron diffraction, a technique used to determine the structure of crystalline materials. Their work significantly advanced our understanding of the atomic structure of materials and has had numerous applications in various fields of physics and engineering.
