The movie "Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!" was narrated by John Brascia. However, the primary narrator for the film is often mistakenly attributed to be John Waters, but that is not correct. John Brascia provided the opening narration for the 1965 cult classic directed by Russ Meyer. It's important to note that while John Waters is a well-known figure in cult cinema, he was not involved in the production of this particular film.
