The Dukan Diet is a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet designed by French physician Pierre Dukan. It is structured into four phases, each with specific goals to help individuals lose weight and maintain weight loss. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the four stages:

1. **Attack Phase**:
   - **Objective**: Quick weight loss by kickstarting metabolism.
   - **Duration**: Typically lasts 1 to 10 days, depending on the desired weight loss.
   - **Diet**: Focuses on high-protein foods such as meat, fish, eggs, and low-fat dairy products. No carbohydrates or fats are allowed.
   - **Exercises**: Recommends 20 minutes of brisk walking daily.

2. **Cruise Phase**:
   - **Objective**: Steady weight loss while introducing more foods.
   - **Duration**: Continues until the desired weight is reached.
   - **Diet**: Alternates between 'pure protein days' and 'protein and vegetable days'. On protein days, only high-protein foods are consumed. On vegetable days, low-carb vegetables are added.
   - **Exercises**: Still recommends daily walks, possibly with some light exercises.

3. **Consolidation Phase**:
   - **Objective**: Prevent rebound weight gain after losing weight.
   - **Duration**: lasts for a number of days equal to half the weight lost in kilograms (e.g., 10 kg lost = 10 days in this phase).
   - **Diet**: Introduces more variety, including dairy products, whole-grain bread, and specific fruits. Portion control is emphasized, and one 'celebration meal' per week is allowed.
   - **Exercises**: Encourages 25 minutes of walking daily, with the addition of other physical activities.

4. **Stabilization Phase**:
   - **Objective**: Long-term weight stabilization, allowing the body to maintain the achieved weight and prevent yo-yo dieting.
   - **Duration**: Indefinite—should be followed for life.
   - **Diet**: Involves three key principles:
       - Eating three main meals a day without snacking.
       - Mandatory once-a-week 'pure protein day'.
       - Drinking plenty of water throughout the day.
   - **Exercises**: Recommends at least 20 minutes of walking six times a week and regular physical activity to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

Each phase transitions smoothly into the next, aiming to promote sustainable weight loss and long-term health. The diet emphasizes protein intake to promote satiety and maintain muscle mass, while gradually reintroducing other food groups to ensure variety and balance in the diet.
