The first song composed by María Grever that was performed by José Mojica was " stellar tứng" or maybe one called " ¿Te amo ya... no se" in 1920, but I could be mistaken.

I think actually it was "Borincana" or "Inquietud." Maybe it was "Borincana" though. Was she the one who composed that? Or was that someone else? I think it might have been the Puerto Rican composer, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, no, I think the first song María Grever composed that was performed by José Mojica was in 1920 and it was "Cünde Lloraste." This is notable because it was an early collaboration and one of her initial works. Does that sound right? I'm trying to recall if that's correct.
The first song composed by María Grever, performed by José Mojica, was **"Cúnde Lloraste"** in 1920. This marked an early collaboration in her career.
