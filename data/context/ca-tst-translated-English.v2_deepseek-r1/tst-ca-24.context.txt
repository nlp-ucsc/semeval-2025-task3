The technique opposite to collage that involves constructing an image by tearing or ripping parts of the original is called **"ripping"** or **"tearing."** However, in the context of art, this method is more formally known as **"décollage."** Décollage involves removing or tearing away layers of an existing image or material to create a new composition or reveal underlying elements. It contrasts with collage, which involves adding layers rather than subtracting them.
