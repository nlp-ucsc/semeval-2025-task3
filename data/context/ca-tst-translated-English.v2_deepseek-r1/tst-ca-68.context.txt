The Pontifical Gregorian University, founded in 1551, was established by Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). Initially, it was called the Collegium Romanum and was later renamed in 1584 in honor of Pope Gregory XIII, who generously supported the institution. Over time, it became one of the most prestigious pontifical universities in Rome, known for its theological and philosophical studies.
