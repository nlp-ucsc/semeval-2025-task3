The Mutoscope was invented by William Kennedy Dickson and his colleague Paul and Joseph Acme, who worked at the Edison Manufacturing Company. It was developed in the late 1800s as a device to display short motion pictures. The Mutoscope used a sequence of still photographs that were displayed in rapid succession, creating the illusion of motion when flipped through. It was one of the earliest devices used for screening motion pictures commercially, preceding the development of movie projectors.
