Real Madrid Castilla, the reserve team of Real Madrid, was founded under the name "Agrupación Deportiva Plus Ultra." This name was used when the club was established in 1948. The name "Plus Ultra" is Latin for "Further Beyond," which reflects the motto of Spain and was chosen to symbolize the team's aspirations. Over time, the club's name was changed to Castilla Club de Fútbol and later to Real Madrid Castilla to align more closely with its parent club, Real Madrid.
