The proton and the antiproton are fundamental particles in physics, specifically classified as baryons. They are matter and antimatter counterparts, respectively. Here are the key differences between them:

1. **Composition**:
   - **Proton**: Composed of three quarks: two up quarks and one down quark (uud).
   - **Antiproton**: Composed of three antiquarks: two anti-up quarks and one anti-down quark (Å«d).

2. **Charge**:
   - **Proton**: Has a positive charge (+1 elementary charge).
   - **Antiproton**: Has a negative charge (-1 elementary charge).

3. **Mass**:
   - Both the proton and the antiproton have the same mass.

4. **Existence**:
   - **Proton**: Constitutes the nucleus of hydrogen atoms and is a stable particle with an extended lifetime.
   - **Antiproton**: A form of antimatter, which is rare in the observable universe but can be produced in high-energy environments or experiments.

5. **Annihilation**:
   - When a proton and an antiproton meet, they annihilate each other, converting their mass into energy, typically resulting in the production of pions.

6. **Magnetic Moment**:
   - The magnetic moments of the proton and antiproton are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

In summary, while the proton and antiproton share the same mass and many other quantum properties, they differ fundamentally in charge, composition, and their roles in matter and antimatter.
