The deepest cave on Earth is called "Veryovkina Cave," located in the Western Caucasus, Georgia. It has a recorded depth of 2,212 meters (7,257 feet), as confirmed by a Ukrainian expedition in 2018. The cave is part of the Arabika Massif and is known for its formidable entrance, which requires climbers to rappel 130 meters (430 feet) just to enter the cave. Beyond that point, the cave extends through a series of challenging passages and shafts. Veryovkina Cave surpasses the previously held record of the Voronya Cave, also known as the "Cave of Swallows," which has a depth of approximately 2,080 meters (6,824 feet). These extreme depths make Veryovkina Cave a focal point of interest for speleologists and adventurers worldwide.
