A **retronym** is a term that is introduced to describe something that was previously referred to by an unqualified term, once a new development or innovation creates the need to distinguish the original from the new version. In simpler terms, it's a word or phrase created to differentiate an older concept or technology from a newer one that has become common.

### Examples of Retronyms:

1. **Landline** (as opposed to mobile phone):
   - Before the widespread use of mobile phones, phones were simply called "phones." With the advent of mobile technology, the term "landline" was coined to refer to the traditional, stationary telephone connected by wires.

2. **Acoustic Guitar** (as opposed to electric guitar):
   - Before the invention of the electric guitar, guitars were naturally "acoustic." Once the electric version became popular, the original was retrospectively labeled as "acoustic."

3. **Snail Mail** (as opposed to email):
   - With the rise of electronic mail ("email"), the traditional postal system became referred to as "snail mail" to highlight its slower nature compared to digital communication.

4. **Film Camera** (as opposed to digital camera):
   - Before digital cameras became mainstream, cameras used film. The term "film camera" was introduced to distinguish it from digital cameras.

5. **Dumbphone** (as opposed to smartphone):
   - This retronym emerged to describe basic mobile phones without the advanced features of smartphones.

### Why Retronyms Are Useful:
Retronyms help clarify and avoid ambiguity in language as new technologies or concepts emerge. They provide a way to refer to the original version of something without confusion, especially when the newer version becomes more common or dominant in usage.

In summary, retronyms are linguistic adjustments that help us distinguish between old and new versions of things, ensuring clear communication as language evolves alongside technology and culture.
