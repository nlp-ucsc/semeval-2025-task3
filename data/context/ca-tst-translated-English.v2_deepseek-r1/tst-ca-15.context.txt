The captain of a football team is typically distinguished from other players in several ways:

1. **Armband**: The most common identifier is the captain's armband, which is worn on the upper arm. This armband usually displays the word "Captain" or the letters "C" and is often provided by the match officials.

2. **Leadership Role**: Captains are often the leaders on the field. They are responsible for communicating with teammates, organizing strategies, and motivating the team. They may also engage more frequently with the referee to discuss decisions or resolve issues.

3. **Set Piece Responsibilities**: Captains frequently take on key roles during set-pieces such as free kicks, corner kicks, and penalty kicks. They might be the one to take penalties or decide who takes them.

4. **Pre-Match Rituals**: Captains typically lead their team onto the field and participate in the coin toss before kickoff. They may also shake hands with the opposing captain and the referee as part of the pre-match ceremonies.

5. **Communication**: Captains are often the primary communicators on the field, directing teammates and maintaining discipline within the team.

6. **Experience and Authority**: Captains are usually the most experienced and respected players on the team, which gives them natural authority and recognition among their peers.

Overall, the armband is the most visible symbol, but their leadership and responsibilities set them apart from other players.
