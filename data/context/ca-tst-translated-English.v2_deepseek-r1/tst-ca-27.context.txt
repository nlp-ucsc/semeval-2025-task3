The name "Favara" likely originates from the Arabic language. In Arabic, the word "fawārah" (فَوَارَة) means "spring" or "source of water." During the Islamic conquest and subsequent domination of Sicily in the 9th and 10th centuries, Arabic became a significant influence on the island's toponyms. The name "Favara" probably refers to a water source or spring in the area, which would have been an important natural feature for the local population. Over time, the name evolved from "Fawara" to "Favara" as Sicily transitioned through various rulers and languages.
