An "interlaced arcade" is a type of architectural feature that combines interlacing arches with an arcade. An arcade, in architecture, typically refers to a series of arches supported by columns or piers, often found in buildings like churches, cloisters, and public structures. When the term "interlaced" is added, it suggests that the arches are intertwined or overlapping in a decorative manner.

Interlacing arches are a common feature in Islamic architecture, where arches are often arranged in intricate patterns, sometimes overlapping or intersecting at their springing points. This creates a visually complex and elegant design. In an interlaced arcade, these interlacing arches would form the structure of the arcade, creating a more ornate and elaborate visual effect compared to a simple arcade with individual arches.

This style can be observed in various historical buildings, particularly in regions influenced by Islamic architectural traditions, where such decorative elements were used to enhance the aesthetic appeal of arcades in courtyards, entranceways, and other areas.
