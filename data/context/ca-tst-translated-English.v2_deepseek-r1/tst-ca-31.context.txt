The Jomsvikings were a legendary group of Viking mercenaries mentioned in Old Norse sagas. They were associated with Jomsborg, a fortress said to be located somewhere in the southern Baltic region, possibly in modern-day Poland. While the Vikings were predominantly Norse pagans, the Jomsvikings were known for their seeming tolerance of Christianity. Although many Vikings remained pagan, by the late 10th and early 11th centuries, Christianity was spreading across Scandinavia. There are accounts suggesting that the Jomsvikings had some Christian members, and they were possibly more open to Christian practices compared to other Viking groups.

However, it's important to note that the Jomsvikings were still primarily a Viking group, and their religious practices would have been a mix of old Norse paganism and potentially early Christian influences, reflecting the transitional period during which they existed. The exact religious composition of the Jomsvikings can be unclear due to the nature of the sources, which are often legendary and written centuries after their time.
