The term "karbóvanets" originates from the Ukrainian word "karbóvannya," which refers to the method of making coins called "milling" or "reeding" — the process of creating grooved edges on coins to prevent clipping or filing of precious metals. This technique was commonly used in the 18th and 19th centuries. 

The karbóvanets was introduced in 1918 as the currency of the Ukrainian People's Republic and continued to be used in various forms until 1920. After Ukraine became part of the Soviet Union, the karbóvanets was eventually replaced by the Soviet ruble. In 1992, following Ukraine's independence, the karbóvanets was briefly reintroduced as a temporary currency before being replaced by the modern Ukrainian hryvnia in 1996.
