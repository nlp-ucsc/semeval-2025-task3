The human eye socket, also known as the orbit, is formed by a complex arrangement of bones that provide protection and support for the eyeball and its associated structures. A total of seven bones contribute to the formation of each orbit:

1. **Frontal Bone**: This is the main bone of the forehead and forms the upper part of the orbit.

2. **Maxilla Bone**: This bone forms the lower part of the orbit and part of the floor of the orbit.

3. **Lacrimal Bone**: A small bone located on the medial (inner) side of the orbit, it forms part of the medial wall and contains the lacrimal sac which is part of the tear drainage system.

4. **Sphenoid Bone**: This bone contributes to the lateral wall of the orbit.

5. **Zygomatic Bone**: Commonly known as the cheekbone, it forms the lateral and lower parts of the orbit.

6. **Nasal Bone**: Although primarily part of the nasal cavity, it contributes to the medial wall of the orbit.

7. **Palatine Bone**: This bone forms part of the floor of the orbit.

These bones work together to create a protective cavity around the eye, ensuring the delicate structures of the eye are safeguarded from external injuries or pressures.
