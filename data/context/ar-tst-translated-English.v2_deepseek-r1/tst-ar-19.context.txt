The scientific name for the genus *Lichen* is actually *Lichen*. However, it's important to note that *Lichen* is not a single genus but rather a term that refers to a symbiotic relationship between fungi and algae or cyanobacteria. Lichens are classified under various genera within the fungal kingdom, depending on the specific species. So, there isn't a single genus named Lichen, but rather many different genera that comprise the lichenized fungi.
