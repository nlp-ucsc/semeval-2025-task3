Publius Quinctilius Varus died during the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD. This battle took place in what is now Germany, near the modern town of Osnabr√ºck. Varus, who was the Roman governor of Germania, led three Roman legions (XVII, XVIII, and XIX) into a trap set by a coalition of Germanic tribes led by Arminius. The battle resulted in the destruction of the three legions and Varus's own death by suicide.
