Emperor Simo is not a recognized emperor in the traditional list of Japanese emperors. It seems there might be a misunderstanding or a typo in the name. If you meant Emperor Sutoku, he is known as the 75th emperor of Japan. However, Emperor Sutoku is more commonly referred to in historical texts and the official lineage. Please clarify if you need information about a specific emperor or any other details.
