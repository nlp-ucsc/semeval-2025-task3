The Folding@home project is currently managed by a team of researchers and scientists led by Dr. Greg Bowman, who is the Director of Folding@home. The project is hosted at Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine. Greg took over the leadership of Folding@home after the project's founder, Dr. Vijay Pande, stepped down as director in 2012. Folding@home is a distributed computing project that focuses on disease research, particularly in the areas of protein folding and related diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and many cancers. The project allows volunteers to donate their computer's processing power to simulate protein dynamics, contributing to scientific research.
