The modern pentathlon was invented in the early 20th century by **Pierre de Coubertin**, a French educator and historian. Coubertin is also widely credited as the founder of the modern **Olympic Games**. He created the modern pentathlon as a multi-discipline event that would reflect the skills of a 19th-century cavalry officer, combining fencing, equestrian show jumping, pistol shooting, swimming, and cross-country running. The event made its Olympic debut at the **1912 Stockholm Olympics**. Since then, it has remained a part of the Olympic program, with adjustments over the years.
