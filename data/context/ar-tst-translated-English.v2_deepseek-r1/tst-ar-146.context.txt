1. **Vanquish (2012-2018)**:
   - **Vanquish**: The base model was introduced in 2012, featuring a 5.9-liter naturally aspirated V12 engine producing 573 horsepower. It was available as a 2+2 coupe or Volante (convertible), and it offered a blend of performance, luxury, and classic Aston Martin design.

2. **Vanquish S (2016-2018)**:
   - Intended to replace the base Vanquish, the Vanquish S models were introduced in 2016. Available in both coupe and Volante forms, the Vanquish S featured minor exterior design updates and an increase in power to 580 horsepower. It also had improvements in handling and driving dynamics.

3. **Vanquish S Ultimate (2017)**:
   - In 2017, to mark the end of the Vanquish's production, Aston Martin released the Vanquish S Ultimate edition. This special edition model came with unique styling details, trim, and color options. It was limited in production and served as a final celebration of the model.

4. **Vanquish Zagato (2016)**:
   - The Vanquish Zagato was a collaboration between Aston Martin and the Italian design house Zagato. Available in coupe and Volante forms, this model featured unique Zagato-designed bodywork, including a distinctive front grille, spoilers, and curved surfaces. It was produced in limited numbers, making it highly exclusive.

5. **Vanquish Zagato Shooting Brake (2018)**:
   - Another limited-edition model, the Vanquish Zagato Shooting Brake combined the Zagato design language with a shooting brake body style. It featured a larger rear compartment and was a unique offering within the Vanquish lineup.

6. **Vanquish Zagato Speedster and Speedster Volante (2018)**:
   - To further expand the Zagato collaboration, Aston Martin introduced the Vanquish Zagato Speedster, which was a two-seater without a roof, and the Speedster Volante. These models were highly exclusive and offered a blend of aggressive styling and performance.

Each of these models and editions brought its own unique character to the Vanquish lineup, offering a combination of performance, luxury, and exclusivity that Aston Martin is known for. The Vanquish has since been succeeded by the Aston Martin DBS Superleggera.
