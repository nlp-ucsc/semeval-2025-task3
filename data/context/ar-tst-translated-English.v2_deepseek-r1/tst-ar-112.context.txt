The genus name "Agastache" is derived from the Greek words "agios" (ἄγιος), meaning "saintly" or "venerable," and "stachys" (στάχυς), meaning "ear of grain" or "spike." This likely refers to the plant's upright, spike-like inflorescences, which resemble an ear of grain. The name was given by the French botanist Jean-Étienne Guettard in the 18th century. So, the name essentially means "venerable spike" or "saintly ear of grain."
