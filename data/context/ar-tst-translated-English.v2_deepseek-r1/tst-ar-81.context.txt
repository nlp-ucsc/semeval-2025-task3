Gordon Strachan did play for Coventry City, and during his time there, he contributed to the team's success, including winning the FA Cup in 1987. However, I don't have the specific information on how many goals he scored during his tenure with Coventry City. For precise statistics, I recommend checking a reliable sports history source or the club's official records.
