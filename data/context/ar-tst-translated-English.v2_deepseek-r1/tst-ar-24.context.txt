You might be referring to 186 AD. Let me check the calendars for that year. According to historical records and using the Gregorian calendar as a reference, January 1, 186 AD, fell on a Monday. However, it's important to note that the Roman Empire used different calendars, and the transition to the Julian calendar around that time might affect the exact day of the week. But based on modern calculations, it is generally accepted that January 1, 186 AD, was a Monday.
