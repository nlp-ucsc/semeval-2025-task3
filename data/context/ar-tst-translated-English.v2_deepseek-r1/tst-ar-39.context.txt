After World War II, Japan was occupied by the Allied Powers, led primarily by the United States, with contributions from other nations. The occupation, which lasted from 1945 to 1952, was formally headed by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP), General Douglas MacArthur. While the U.S. played the dominant role, other countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, India, and the Soviet Union also participated in the occupation and reconstruction efforts. The main goal was to demilitarize and democratize Japan, leading to significant changes in its political, economic, and social structures.
