The German cruiser *Emden* played a significant role in World War I, particularly during its raiding campaigns in the early stages of the war. However, its life came to an end during the *Battle of Cocos* on November 9, 1914.

1. **Background**: The *Emden* was a light cruiser of the German Kaiserliche Marine. It was known for its agility and speed, which made it a formidable commerce raider. Under the command of Captain Karl von M端ller, the *Emden* was detached from the German East Asia Squadron and sent to the Indian Ocean to disrupt Allied shipping lanes.

2. **Raiding Campaign**: The *Emden* began its raiding campaign in August 1914, capturing or sinking several Allied merchant ships and even attacking the port of Madras (now Chennai) in British India. Its actions caused significant disruption to Allied shipping and gained notoriety for its chivalrous conduct, as Captain M端ller often allowed crews and passengers of captured ships to disembark before sinking the vessels.

3. **Battle of Cocos**: While attempting to raid the British cable station on Direction Island in the Cocos Islands, the *Emden* encountered the Australian light cruiser *HMAS Sydney* on November 9, 1914. The *Sydney* was part of a larger Australian- British fleet searching for the *Emden*. Despite being outgunned and outnumbered, the *Emden* engaged the *Sydney* in a fierce battle.

4. **Outcome of the Battle**: The *Emden* fought valiantly but was severely outclassed by the more heavily armed *Sydney*. After a prolonged engagement, the *Emden* was heavily damaged, with significant casualties. Realizing the futility of continuing the fight, Captain von M端ller ordered the crew to scuttle the ship to prevent further loss of life.

5. **Aftermath**: The *Emden* was run aground on North Keeling Island to prevent it from sinking entirely. The survivors, including Captain von M端ller, were captured by the Australians. The *Emden*'s wreck remained on the reef for many years, eventually breaking up over time due to natural forces.

The *Emden*'s exploits during World War I earned it a legendary status in naval history, celebrated not only for its military prowess but also for the humanity shown by its crew during their raids.
