The main disadvantage of the H-shaped engine in racing cars is its poor balance and rotational properties. Unlike inline or V-type engines, H-shaped engines are designed with two banks of cylinders on either side of a central crankshaft, which can lead to a higher center of gravity and increased rotational imbalance. This imbalance can result in vibration issues, making it less ideal for high-performance applications where smooth power delivery and stability are crucial. Additionally, the complexity of the H-shaped engine's design can lead to higher manufacturing costs and increased weight compared to more conventional engine configurations.
