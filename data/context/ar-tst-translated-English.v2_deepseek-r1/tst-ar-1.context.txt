The word "Pentastomida" refers to an order of parasitic crustaceans, commonly known as tongue worms. These organisms are typically found in the respiratory systems of vertebrates, such as mammals and birds. The name "Pentastomida" comes from the Greek words "pente," meaning five, and "stoma," meaning mouth, likely referring to the five pairs of hooks around their mouth. They are often mistaken for worms due to their elongated bodies, but they are actually crustaceans.
