The scientist who first described the condition of progeria was Dr. Jonathan Hutchinson. He identified the disorder in 1886, and it was later named Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome in recognition of his work, along with Dr. Hastings Gilford, who also contributed to the understanding of the condition.
