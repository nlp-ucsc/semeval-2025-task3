To determine the day of the week for January 1st, 830 AD according to the Julian calendar, I can use Zeller's Congruence. This is a mathematical algorithm that helps calculate the day of the week for any given date. 

First, I will break down the components needed for the calculation:
- The date in question is January 1, 830 AD.
- The Julian calendar was used during this period.

Next, I will apply the formula for Zeller's Congruence, which requires converting the date into the appropriate variables for the formula. After calculating each part, I will add the components together and take the modulus to find the result.

Finally, interpreting the result will tell me the day of the week. If the result is 0, it corresponds to a Saturday; if it's 1, it's a Sunday, and so on up to 6 for a Friday.

Through this method, I determine that January 1st, 830 AD according to the Julian calendar fell on a Wednesday.

To determine the day of the week for **January 1, 830 AD** according to the **Julian calendar**, we can use **Zeller's Congruence**, a mathematical algorithm that allows us to calculate the day of the week for any given date.

Zeller's Congruence formula for the Julian calendar is:

\[
h = (q + \left\lfloor \frac{13(m + 1)}{5} \right\rfloor + K + \left\lfloor \frac{K}{4} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{J}{4} \right\rfloor + 5J) \mod 7
\]

Where:
- \( h \) is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday).
- \( q \) is the day of the month.
- \( m \) is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 14 = February).
- \( K \) is the year of the century (\( \text{year} \mod 100 \)).
- \( J \) is the zero-based century (\( \left\lfloor \frac{\text{year}}{100} \right\rfloor \)).

### Given:
- **Date:** January 1, 830 AD
- **r:** Adjustment for the Julian calendar (\( r = 5 \)).

### Step 1: Adjust the month and year
Since the Julian calendar treats January as month **13** of the previous year:
- \( m = 13 \)
- \( q = 1 \)
- Adjust the year: \( 830 - 1 = 829 \)
  - \( K = 829 \mod 100 = 29 \)
  - \( J = \left\lfloor \frac{829}{100} \right\rfloor = 8 \)

### Step 2: Apply Zeller's Congruence
\[
h = (1 + \left\lfloor \frac{13(13 + 1)}{5} \right\rfloor + 29 + \left\lfloor \frac{29}{4} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{4} \right\rfloor + 5 \times 8) \mod 7
\]

Calculate each term:
\[
h = (1 + \left\lfloor \frac{182}{5} \right\rfloor + 29 + 7 + 2 + 40) \mod 7
\]
\[
h = (1 + 36 + 29 + 7 + 2 + 40) \mod 7
\]
\[
h = 115 \mod 7
\]
\[
115 \div 7 = 16 \text{ remainder } 3
\]
\[
h = 3
\]

### Step 3: Interpret the result
In the Julian calendar:
\[
h = 3 \implies \text{Wednesday}
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{Wednesday}}
\]
