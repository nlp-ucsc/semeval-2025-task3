Ernest Cole was a South African photographer who was most active during the 1960s. He is best known for his work documenting the lives of South Africans under apartheid, particularly focusing on the harsh conditions faced by Black South Africans. His photographs often highlighted the social and economic inequalities of the time.

Ernest Cole's specialization was in documentary photography, using his camera to expose the realities of apartheid and to give voice to those who were marginalized and oppressed. His work is considered some of the most significant visual documentation of that era, and it has had a lasting impact on the understanding of South Africa's history.

Cole's book, "House of Bondage," published in 1967, is one of his most famous works. It is a collection of photographs that graphically depict the suffering of Black South Africans under apartheid. The book was banned in South Africa after its publication but has since become a crucial historical resource.

Unfortunately, Ernest Cole's life was marked by hardship and displacement. After facing increasing harassment from the South African authorities due to his work, he went into exile, first to the United States and later to Sweden. He died in relative obscurity in 1990. However, in recent years, his work has gained international recognition, and he is now celebrated as a courageous and important photographer who used his art to fight against injustice.
