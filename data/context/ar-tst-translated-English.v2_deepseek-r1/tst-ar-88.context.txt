During Denmark's Golden Age, which spanned roughly from the late 18th century to the mid-19th century, several architectural styles emerged and flourished. Here are the key architectural styles that developed during this period:

### 1. **Neoclassicism**
   **- Influences:** Inspired by ancient Greek and Roman architecture, Neoclassicism was a dominant style during Denmark's Golden Age. Architects sought to emulate the simplicity, proportion, and harmony of classical antiquity.
   **- Key Features:** Symmetrical facades, use of columns, pilasters, and architraves. Buildings often featured domes and pediments.
   **- Notable Examples:** 
     - **The Old Church of Holmen (Holmenskirken)** in Copenhagen.
     - **The Thorvaldsens Museum**, designed by Michael Gottlieb Bindesbøll, which showcases a blend of Neoclassical and Egyptian influences.
   **- Architects:** Michael Gottlieb Bindesbøll and Christian Frederik Hansen were prominent figures in this style.

### 2. **Historicism**
   **- Influences:** As the Golden Age progressed, historicism became more prevalent. This style drew inspiration from various historical periods, including medieval and Renaissance architecture.
   **- Key Features:** The use of Gothic elements such as pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and flying buttresses became more common. Brick was a popular material.
   **- Notable Examples:**
     - **The Church of Our Lady (Vor Frue Kirke)** in Copenhagen, with its striking Gothic spire.
     - **The Copenhagen City Hall (Rådhus)**, which blends Gothic and Romanesque styles.
   **- Architects:** Johan Daniel Herholdt and Theophilus Hansen contributed to this style.

### 3. **Rationalism**
   **- Influences:** Rationalist architecture emphasized functionality and practicality, influenced by the Enlightenment's focus on reason and intellectual pursuits.
   **- Key Features:** Simplified forms, minimal ornamentation, and an emphasis on the building's purpose. Large windows and open spaces were used to maximize light and functionality.
   **- Notable Examples:**
     - **The Royal Danish Theatre (Det Kongelige Teater)** in Copenhagen.
     - **The Round Tower (Rundetårn)**, though built earlier, saw continued use during this period.
   **- Architects:** Christian Frederik Hansen and Lauritz de Thurah were key figures in this style.

### 4. **Romantic Nationalism**
   **- Influences:** Romantic Nationalism emerged in the early 19th century, emphasizing a connection to Denmark's medieval past and national identity.
   **- Key Features:** Use of brick, stepped gables, and Gothic revival elements. Castles and churches were often built in this style to evoke a sense of historical continuity.
   **- Notable Examples:**
     - **Søborg Castle (Søborghus)**, which was restored during this period.
     - **Frederiksborg Castle (Frederiksborg Slot)**, which was rebuilt after a fire in a Romantic Nationalist style.
   **- Architects:** Ferdinand Meldahl and Vilhelm Dahlerup were prominent in this movement.

### 5. **Danish Folk Architecture**
   **- Influences:** The traditional Danish half-timbered (fachwerk) houses and thatched roofs continued to be prevalent, especially in rural areas.
   **- Key Features:** Half-timbered construction (bindingsværk), steeply pitched roofs, and small windows.
   **- Notable Examples:**
     - Traditional farmhouses and village houses across Denmark.
     - The **Open-Air Museum (Frilandsmuseet)** near Copenhagen showcases many examples of Danish folk architecture.

### Conclusion:
Denmark's Golden Age was marked by a rich diversity in architectural styles, reflecting the cultural, intellectual, and nationalistic sentiments of the time. Neoclassicism dominated the early part of the period, while Historicism and Romantic Nationalism became more prominent towards the mid-19th century. These styles not only influenced building design but also played a significant role in shaping Denmark's national identity.
