The opera considered "the most important English opera composed between Purcell and Britten" by Ethel Mary Smyth is "Dido and Aeneas" by Henry Purcell. However, since Purcell himself is one end of the timeline mentioned, it's more likely that Smyth was referring to another work. A possible candidate could be "Harrison Birtwistle's 'The Mask of Orpheus'" or other significant English operas, but the exact reference needs clarification.
