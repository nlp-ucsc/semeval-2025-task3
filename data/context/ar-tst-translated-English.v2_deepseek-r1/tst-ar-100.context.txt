The earthquake belt that leads the world in seismic activity and is located before the Alpine belt is the **Pacific Ring of Fire**. This vast zone of intense seismic and volcanic activity stretches from New Zealand, along the eastern edge of Asia, through the Philippines, Japan, and the Aleutian Islands, and down the western coast of North and South America. The Pacific Ring of Fire is home to over 75% of the world's active volcanoes and experiences 90% of the world's largest earthquakes.

### Key Features of the Pacific Ring of Fire:
1. **Subduction Zones**: The primary driver of seismic activity in this region is the subduction of oceanic plates under continental or other oceanic plates. This process leads to deep-sea trenches, frequent earthquakes, and volcanic arcs.
   
2. **Volcanic Activity**: The subduction of plates also results in the rise of magma, creating hundreds of active volcanoes, many of which are highly explosive.

3. **Major Earthquakes**: The region is prone to megathrust earthquakes, such as the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan, due to the interaction between tectonic plates.

4. **Countries Affected**: Notable countries within the Pacific Ring of Fire include Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Chile, Mexico, and the United States (particularly Alaska and the West Coast).

### Significance:
The Pacific Ring of Fire is not only the most seismically active region but also has a significant impact on global geology, climate, and human populations due to its frequent and powerful earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
