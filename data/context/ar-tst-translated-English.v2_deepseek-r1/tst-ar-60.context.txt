The Kurdistan Free Life Party, known as PJAK, is primarily focused on advocating for the rights and freedoms of the Kurdish people in Iran and fostering Kurdish cultural identity. The party aims to promote democracy and human rights within the region. However, it's important to note that PJAK has been designated as a terrorist organization by several countries, including the United States and Iran, due to its alleged links to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is also a designated terrorist group. As such, the activities and objectives of PJAK should be considered within the context of international law and regional politics.
