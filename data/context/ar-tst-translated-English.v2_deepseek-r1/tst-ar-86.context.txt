The terms "oval" and "ellipse" are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings in different contexts, particularly in mathematics and art.

An "ellipse" is a precise mathematical concept. It is defined as the set of all points in a plane where the sum of the distances from two fixed points (foci) is constant. This definition comes from geometry and is used in various fields like physics, engineering, and astronomy. An ellipse has a standard equation and specific properties, such as major and minor axes, which define its shape and size.

On the other hand, an "oval" is a more general term that refers to a shape resembling a squashed circle or an egg shape. It is not as strictly defined as an ellipse and is often used in informal contexts, art, and design to describe a shape that is roughly elliptical but not necessarily meeting the precise mathematical criteria of an ellipse. Ovals can have more irregular shapes and asymmetries that deviate from the perfect symmetry of an ellipse.

In summary, while all ellipses are ovals, not all ovals are ellipses. The key difference lies in the level of mathematical precision and the specific definitions that apply to each term.
