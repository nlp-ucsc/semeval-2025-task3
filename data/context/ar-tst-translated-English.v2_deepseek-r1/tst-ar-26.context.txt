Fortescue is a small town in Western Australia, located near the Burrup Peninsula. As of the knowledge cutoff in July 2024, there is no widely available information specifying the exact elevation of Fortescue above sea level. It is situated in a relatively low-lying coastal area, and elevations in such regions are typically not very high. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking with local geographical surveys or official sources.
