The primary source of funding for the construction of the new Groningen Museum, which opened in 1994, came from a combination of public and private contributions. The museum's expansion and modernization were supported by government grants, municipal funding from the city of Groningen, and private donations. Additionally, the museum engaged in fundraising efforts and partnered with local businesses and cultural organizations to secure the necessary resources for the project. This collaborative approach ensured the successful completion of the new museum building, designed by the architects Alessandro Mendini, Michele De Lucchi, Coop Himmelblau, and Philippe Starck.
