The Samnites were an ancient Italic people who lived in what is now southern Italy, primarily in the region of Samnium. They spoke a language belonging to the Osco-Umbrian branch of the Italic languages. The Osco-Umbrian languages were a group of Indo-European languages spoken by various tribes in pre-Roman Italy, including the Samnites, Osci, Umbri, and others.

Samnite language is known through inscriptions, some of which are written in the Latin alphabet. The language is quite similar to other Osco-Umbrian dialects, and it shares many features with Oscan, which was spoken by the Osci, a neighboring Italic tribe. The Samnite language is considered part of the South Picene or Samnite group within the Osco-Umbrian branch.

The Samnites were eventually romanized, particularly after the Second Punic War, and their language gradually gave way to Latin as the Roman Republic expanded its control over Italy.

So, in summary, the Samnites spoke an Osco-Umbrian language, which is a branch of the Italic languages.
