The art of collage, which involves creating compositions by combining fragments of different materials and objects, has its origins in various forms of artistic expression across different cultures and time periods. However, the modern concept of collage as we know it today emerged primarily in the early 20th century in Europe.

One of the key movements associated with the development of collage is Cubism, pioneered by artists like Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque during the early 1910s. They began incorporating newspaper clippings, fabric, and other materials into their paintings, which challenged traditional techniques of representing reality and explored new ways of expressing form and space.

This innovation was further expanded by artists associated with the Dada movement in the 1910s and 1920s. Dadaists like Hannah HÃ¶ch and Kurt Schwitters used collage to create satirical and politically charged works, often using found materials to critique modern society and conventions.

Thus, while collage-like techniques can be found in earlier art forms, the modern art of collage as a distinct artistic practice originated in the context of Cubism and Dadaism in the early 20th century in Europe.
