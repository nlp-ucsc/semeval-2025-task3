The herb fly, also known as the *Eristalis* species, belongs to the family **Syrphidae**. The Syrphidae family is commonly known as the hoverfly or flower fly family. These flies are often mistaken for wasps or bees due to their similar appearance, but they are actually true flies (order Diptera) and are harmless to humans.
