Dual-use products are subject to special laws and controls because they have both civilian and military applications. This dual nature makes them sensitive from a national security and international relations perspective. Here are some key reasons why these products are regulated:

1. ** Prevention of Proliferation**: Dual-use items, such as certain chemicals, technologies, or materials, can be used in the development of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). To prevent the proliferation of such weapons, countries implement export controls and other regulations to ensure these items do not fall into the wrong hands.

2. ** National Security**: The misuse of dual-use products can pose a direct threat to a nation's security. By controlling the export and distribution of these items, governments can reduce the risk of them being used in military applications against their interests.

3. ** International Obligations**: Many countries are part of international treaties and agreements, such as the Wassenaar Arrangement or the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which require them to regulate the transfer of dual-use goods and technologies. These international frameworks aim to prevent the spread of weapons and technologies that could be used for military purposes.

4. ** Ethical Considerations**: There is an ethical responsibility to ensure that products are not used in ways that could lead to human rights violations or conflicts. By controlling dual-use items, governments can help prevent their use in unethical or harmful activities.

5. ** Balance Between Trade and Security**: While dual-use products are important for civilian applications, their potential for misuse necessitates a balance between promoting trade and protecting security interests. Special laws and controls help achieve this balance.

Overall, the regulation of dual-use products is crucial for maintaining global security, upholding international agreements, and preventing the misuse of sensitive technologies.
