The newspapers' complaints against the silent observer typically revolve around the notion that a silent observer, by definition, does not actively engage or contribute to the conversation or issue at hand. This can lead to several concerns:

1. **Lack of Transparency**: Newspapers might argue that a silent observer does not provide clarity or insight into their thought process or intentions, making it difficult to understand their stance or role in a situation.

2. **Passive Engagement**: The silent observer may be seen as unresponsive or disengaged, which can hinder effective communication and collaboration, particularly in scenarios where active participation is crucial.

3. **Perceived Bias**: If a silent observer is present but not contributing, newspapers might speculate about hidden agendas or biases, which could undermine trust in the observer's neutrality.

4. **Impact on Dynamics**: In group settings, a silent observer can sometimes alter the dynamics, making others uncomfortable or self-conscious, potentially stifling open discussion.

These complaints highlight the tension between the observer's need to remain neutral and the desire for active engagement and transparency.
