Sakata City, located in Yamagata Prefecture, Japan, was officially established on April 1, 1933. However, the history of the area dates back much further, with Sakata flourishing as a port town during the Edo period (1603â€“1867) and serving as an important center for trade and commerce in the region. The modern city was formed through the merger of the town of Sakata with neighboring villages, leading to its official establishment in 1933.
