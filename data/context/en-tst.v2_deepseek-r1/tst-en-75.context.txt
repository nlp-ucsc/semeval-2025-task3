The first settlers of Steelville, Missouri were likely European-Americans who arrived in the area during the early 19th century. The region was part of the Osage Native American territory until the U.S. government began opening it up for settlement. As the area was attractive for farming and logging, settlers were drawn there. The establishment of Steelville itself is often linked to the arrival of the railroad in the late 19th century, which brought more settlers and facilitated growth. The exact identities of the earliest settlers would require more specific historical records to determine.
