Yes, Zonitoides, a genus of small land snails in the family Gastrodontidae, is known to use love darts during courtship. These snails are hermaphroditic, meaning they have both male and female reproductive organs. During mating, they often engage in a ritual where one snail shoots a tiny dart made of calcium carbonate at its partner. This behavior is also observed in other gastropod species and is believed to play a role in increasing the chances of successful fertilization. While the exact purpose of love darts is not fully understood, they are thought to aid in mate selection or preparation for reproduction.
