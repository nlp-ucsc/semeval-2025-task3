International Klein Blue was developed by the French artist Yves Klein in the 1950s. He patented this particular shade of blue, known as IKB (International Klein Blue), in 1960. Klein was a prominent figure in the development of the Nouveau RÃ©alisme artistic movement and was known for his monochromatic works, which explored the emotional and spiritual aspects of color. IKB is a deep, rich blue that became a hallmark of his work and was achieved through the use of a specific mixture of synthetic resin and pure ultramarine pigment. This pigment was later produced commercially under his supervision, allowing other artists and users to utilize the distinctive International Klein Blue in their own work.
