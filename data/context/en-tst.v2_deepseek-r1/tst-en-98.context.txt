The Roman coin that was first minted in 268 BC is the **denarius**. The denarius was a small silver coin that became one of the most common Roman coins. It was introduced during the **Second Punic War** (218â€“201 BC), specifically in 211 BC, not 268 BC. 

However, if you are referring to 268 BC, it's important to note that the Romans began issuing their earliest coins, which were based on Greek models, around that time. These early coins included the **didrachm**, which was a silver coin minted in Neapolis (Naples) and other Italian cities under Roman control. But the denarius itself was introduced later, in 211 BC, and became a standard Roman coin.
