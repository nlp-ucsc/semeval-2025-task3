Garajonay National Park, located on the island of La Gomera in the Canary Islands, Spain, is named after the indigenous Guanche king, Garajonay. The name "Garajonay" comes from the Guanche language, where "gara" means "highest" and "jonay" or "jodel" refers to a place or area. Thus, the park's name signifies the highest place, likely referring to the park's high elevation and panoramic views. The park is known for its lush forests, deep ravines, and the Roque de Garajonay, a striking rock formation that is one of the park's iconic landmarks. The area holds significant natural and cultural importance, preserving the natural beauty and historical heritage of the Canary Islands.
