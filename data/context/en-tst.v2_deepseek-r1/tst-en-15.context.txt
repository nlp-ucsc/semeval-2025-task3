The Estrada de Ferro Além Paraíba (E.F.A.P.), also known as the Empreza Ferro Carril Além Parahyba, was a railway in Brazil that operated primarily in the state of Minas Gerais. It was established in the late 19th century and was in operation until the mid-20th century. The exact years of operation are not readily available, but it is known that many Brazilian railways from that era began construction in the 1870s and 1880s and continued operations well into the 1900s. If more specific information is needed, it might be helpful to consult historical records or local archives related to the railway.
