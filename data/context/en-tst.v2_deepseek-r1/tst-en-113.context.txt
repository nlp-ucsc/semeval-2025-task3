As of my last update in July 2024, I don't have specific information on the population of Valeille as of 2020. Population figures can often be found through official sources like the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) or local government websites. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking these official sources directly.
