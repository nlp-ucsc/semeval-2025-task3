Yes, in Colombia, the President is limited to serving a maximum of two four-year terms. This rule was established by the 2015 constitutional reform, which specifically restricted the President to two terms, whether served consecutively or not. This reform was enacted under President Juan Manuel Santos and came into effect as a result of his efforts to prevent unlimited re-election, ensuring that the presidency does not become a lifelong position and promoting political change and succession in the country.
