Yes, the genus *Abrus* includes plants native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Within the Americas, you can find species such as *Abrus baloot* and *Abrus precatorius*, which are distributed in Central and South America, as well as in the Caribbean. These plants are known for their seeds, which are used in jewelry, but they contain a toxic compound called abrin. The seeds, while attractive, are highly poisonous if ingested.
