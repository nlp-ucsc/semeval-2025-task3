No, not all fodies are red. The term refers to a group of bird species in the genus *Foudia*, which are commonly known as fodies or weavers. These birds are found primarily in the Indian Ocean region, including Madagascar and surrounding islands.

While some species of fodies, like the *Foudia madagascariensis* (Madagascar fody), are known for their striking red plumage during the breeding season, especially the males, this is not true for all species. Other species may have different colorations, such as brown or olive tones, and the colors can also vary by gender and season.

Additionally, juvenile fodies typically have more subdued coloration compared to adults and may lack the bright red feathers. Therefore, not all fodies are red, but some are known for their vibrant red appearance during certain times of the year.
