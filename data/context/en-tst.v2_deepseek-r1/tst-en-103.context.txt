Yes, in some Buddhist traditions, especially in Mahayana Buddhism, it's possible to receive more than one Dharma name. These names are typically given during important spiritual milestones, such as when one takes refuge in the Three Jewels, when they receive monkhood or nunhood, or during other significant ceremonies.

### When Might One Receive Multiple Dharma Names?
1. **Refuge Ceremony**: When someone formally becomes a Buddhist by taking refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, they might receive a Dharma name.
2. **Ordination**: Monks and nuns often receive new names upon ordination, symbolizing their renunciation of lay life and their commitment to the monastic path.
3. **Dharma Transmission**: In some Zen traditions, a practitioner might receive a Dharma name when they receive Dharma transmission, indicating they are recognized as a lineage holder.
4. **Special Ceremonies**: In some cultures or traditions, additional names might be given during special rites or as a mark of progress in the spiritual journey.

### Significance of Dharma Names
- **Spiritual Identity**: A Dharma name often reflects a quality, virtue, or aspiration on the spiritual path, such as "Loving Kindness" or "Wisdom."
- **Renewal and Transformation**: Receiving a new name can symbolize transformation, renewal, or a deepening commitment to the Buddhist path.
- **Lineage Connection**: In some cases, the name may connect the practitioner to their lineage or teacher.

### Cultural Variations
The practices around Dharma names can vary widely between different Buddhist traditions and cultures. For example:
- In **Zen** and **Chinese Buddhism**, Dharma names are often given more formally.
- In **Tibetan Buddhism**, initiatory names might be given by a Lama.
- In **Theravada** communities, the practice is less common, but names may still be given upon ordination.

Ultimately, whether one receives multiple Dharma names depends on the specific tradition and the practices of their community or teacher.
