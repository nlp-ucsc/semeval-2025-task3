Sergei Parajanov was influenced by a variety of filmmakers and artists, but he was perhaps most inspired by the works of *Andrei Tarkovsky*, another renowned Soviet filmmaker known for his poetic and visually stunning films. Their mutual respect for each other's work is well-documented, and Parajanov's own films, such as "The Color of Pomegranates" (1969) and "Ashik Kerib" (1988), share a similar contemplative and symbolic style. Another significant influence on Parajanov was *Yuri Ilienko*, a Ukrainian filmmaker with whom he collaborated and who worked in a similar vein of poetic cinema. Additionally, Parajanov drew inspiration from the world of ballet and theater, particularly the works of *Vladimir Tatlin*, a／／

Okay, let me try that again. So, the user is asking which filmmakers influenced Sergei Parajanov. I know Parajanov was a Soviet filmmaker with a very unique style, so I should list the people who had an impact on his work.

First off, Andrei Tarkovsky comes to mind because both are known for their poetic and visually rich films. They were contemporaries and respected each other, so that's a key point.

I also recall that Yuri Ilienko was a collaborator and possibly an influence. Maybe they worked together on some projects, which would have shaped Parajanov's style.

Then, thinking about Parajanov's background, he worked in ballet and theater, so maybe figures from those fields influenced him. Vladimir Tatlin is a name that pops up, perhaps for his work in set design and the avant-garde movement.

I should also include some international directors he admired, like Federico Fellini and Akira Kurosawa, since their work is Russians often followed global cinema trends.

Oh, and Eisenstein should be mentioned because he's a classic, though Parajanov's style is different, his early work might have been influenced by Eisenstein's montage techniques.

I need to structure this clearly, grouping them under Soviet/Russian, International, and Theater/Ballet influences. Also, mentioning his LOVE of world cinema in general ties it all together.

Wait, did I miss any key figures? Maybe someone else, but I think this covers the main ones. I should make sure each filmmaker is correctly associated with their influence on Parajanov, like how Tarkovsky and Iliekno shaped his poetic style, or Fellini for visual surrealism.

Also, noting that Parajanov's own unique approach blended these influences into something entirely new would make the answer more comprehensive.

Okay, I think I have a solid list. Time to put it all together in a coherent way, using bullet points for clarity. I should mention each influence with a brief explanation so the user understands the connection.
