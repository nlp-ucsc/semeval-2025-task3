Theano, a pre-Socratic philosopher, is commonly associated with the Pythagorean school. The Pythagoreans were known for their philosophical and mathematical contributions, particularly in the areas of numbers and the structure of the universe. Theano, as a female member of this school, contributed to the development of Pythagorean thought, which emphasized the concept that numbers are the fundamental principles of the universe. Her work likely involved the study of mathematics and music theory, which were central to Pythagorean teachings. Thus, Theano's philosophical affiliations were aligned with the Pythagorean tradition.
