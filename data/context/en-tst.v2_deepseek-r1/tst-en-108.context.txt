The concept of pleiotropy, where a single gene influences multiple phenotypic traits, was first observed and described in the early 20th century. One of the key figures associated with the discovery and experimentation of pleiotropic traits is the German geneticist and Nobel laureate **Edgar Schuster**. Schuster's work in the 1900s involved experiments with apparent usb√§lg yellow and NUnit in mice. He observed that a single mutation could affect multiple traits, such as coat color and other phenotypic characteristics. This phenomenon was initially termed ".duplex progeny" but was later named pleiotropy by the German geneticist **Wilhelm Johannsen** in 1909. These early experiments laid the groundwork for our understanding of how genes can have multiple effects on an organism's phenotype.
