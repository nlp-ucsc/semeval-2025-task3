The family of false saber-toothed cats named by Edward Drinker Cope is **Barbourofelidae**. They were a group of large predatory mammals that belonged to the order Carnivora but were not members of the Felidae (true cats) or Machairodontinae (saber-toothed cats). Instead, they were more closely related to the Viverridae (civets and genets). Barbourofelids were characterized by their elongated canines and robust builds, and they were prominent during the Miocene and Pliocene epochs in North America, Europe, and Asia. Cope described this family in 1892.
