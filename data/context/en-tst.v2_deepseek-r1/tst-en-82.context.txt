The Federal Department is not one of the provinces, but the independent city. The provinces are outside of it.

The Federal Department is part of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina. It's one of the departments that make up the city, and it's where the federal government is located. So, the Federal Department is in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, not in one of the traditional provinces.
