Hugh Fraser played the role of Hastings in the TV series "Agatha Christie's Poirot." In this series, Hastings is the close friend and biographer of the famous detective Hercule Poirot, portrayed by David Suchet. Fraser's performance as Hastings was well-received, as he effectively portrayed the character's loyalty and sometimes comedic foil to Poirot's more serious and eccentric personality.
