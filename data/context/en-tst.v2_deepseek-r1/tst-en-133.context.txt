Formentera, a small island in the Balearic Islands, Spain, is home to several Martello towers, also known as "martellos." These structures were built during the 18th century by the British and later by the Spanish as defensive fortifications to protect against pirate attacks and other threats.

There are **four** Martello towers on Formentera, each strategically located to cover different parts of the island's coastline. These towers are:

1. **Torre de sa Punta Prima** - Located on the northeastern coast.
2. **Torre de s'Alga** - Situated on the western side near the Cape of s'Alga.
3. **Torre de ses Coves Blanques** - Found on the southern coast near the beach of ses Coves Blanques.
4. **Torre de es Cap Blanc** - Located on the southern part of the island.

These Martello towers are important historical landmarks and have been well-preserved, offering insights into Formentera's military past while also serving as popular attractions for tourists.
