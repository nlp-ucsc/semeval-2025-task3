John Christopher Willis, often referred to as J.C. Willis, was a British botanist known for his work in the early 20th century. He made significant contributions to the field of botany, particularly in the areas of plant ecology and biogeography. Willis is perhaps best known for his "Age and Area" hypothesis, which he proposed in 1922 as an alternative explanation for the geographical distribution of species.

The "Age and Area" hypothesis suggested that the size of a species' geographical range is primarily determined by its age. According to this theory, older species tend to have larger ranges because they have had more time to disperse and colonize new areas. This idea was seen as a challenge to some aspects of Darwinian natural selection, as it proposed a different mechanism for the distribution patterns of species.

However, it is important to note that Willis was not entirely opposed to the concept of natural selection. He acknowledged its role in evolution but sought to provide additional explanations for certain observational data that he believed were not fully accounted for by natural selection alone. Over time, Willis' "Age and Area" hypothesis has been largely supplanted by more comprehensive theories in evolutionary biology and biogeography, though his work remains an interesting historical footnote in the development of these fields.

In summary, John Christopher Willis was not a proponent of natural selection in the sense that he sought to modify or supplement the theory with his own hypotheses, particularly the "Age and Area" theory. However, he did not reject natural selection outright but rather offered complementary or alternative explanations for certain aspects of species distribution.
