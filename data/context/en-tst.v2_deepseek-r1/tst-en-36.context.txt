Voice disorders are typically associated with the **larynx (voice box)** and the **vocal cords**. The larynx is located in the neck and plays a crucial role in producing sound for speech and singing. The vocal cords, which are two bands of muscle tissue located inside the larynx, vibrate to produce sound. 

Here are the key structures involved in voice production and commonly associated with voice disorders:

1. **Vocal cords (Vocal Folds):** These are the primary structures responsible for sound production. Disorders such as vocal cord polyps, nodules, or paralysis can lead to voice problems.

2. **Larynx:** The larynx houses the vocal cords and regulates the tension and length of the cords, which affects pitch and volume. Conditions like laryngitis or laryngeal cancer can cause voice disorders.

3. **Throat (Pharynx):** The throat is part of the resonating cavity that modifies the sound produced by the vocal cords. Infections or obstructions in the throat can affect voice quality.

4. **Trachea:** The trachea, or windpipe, is connected to the larynx and ensures airflow reaches the lungs. Blockages or conditions affecting the trachea can indirectly impact voice.

5. **Lung:** The lungs provide the airflow necessary for the vocal cords to vibrate and produce sound. Lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), can affect breathing and voice production.

6. **Brain and Nervous System:** The brain and nervous system control the muscles involved in voice production. Conditions like Parkinson's disease, stroke, or vocal cord paralysis can lead to voice disorders due to nerve damage.

In summary, voice disorders are primarily linked to the larynx and vocal cords, but they can also involve other structures like the throat, trachea, lungs, and nervous system.
