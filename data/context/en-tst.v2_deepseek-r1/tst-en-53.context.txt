The Spotted Blue-eye (Pseudomugil gertrudae) is a species of fish that is native to Australia. They are small, schooling fish that typically inhabit freshwater and brackish environments, such as streams, rivers, and estuaries. 

In terms of their diet, Spotted Blue-eyes are omnivorous, which means they eat a variety of food sources. Their diet generally includes:

1. Small Insects: They feed on insects, both larvae and adults, that are present in the water or at the water's surface.

2. Algae: They consume various types of algae that grow on rocks and other surfaces in their habitat.

3. Zooplankton: Zooplankton, such as tiny crustaceans, are also part of their diet.

4. Detritus: They may eat detritus, which is dead and decaying organic matter found in the water.

In aquarium settings, Spotted Blue-eyes can be fed a varied diet that includes high-quality flakes, small pellets, live or frozen brine shrimp, and daphnia. It's important to provide them with a balanced diet to ensure their health and well-being.
