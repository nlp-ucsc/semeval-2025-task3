Yes, there were other Kalanga-speaking kingdoms aside from the Kingdom of Zimbabwe. The Kalanga people have a rich history that spans across present-day Zimbabwe, Botswana, and parts of South Africa. One notable Kalanga-speaking kingdom was the Kingdom of Butua, which was also known as the Butwa kingdom or the descendants of the Changamire. This kingdom existed from around the 14th to the 19th century and was a significant political and cultural entity in the region, particularly in what is now southern Zimbabwe.

The Kingdom of Butua was well-known for its powerful leaders, such as the Changamire mapungubwe, who played important roles in regional trade and politics. Although the Kingdom of Zimbabwe is more widely recognized due to its association with the Great Zimbabwe ruins, the Kingdom of Butua also had its own distinct influence and history in the area.
