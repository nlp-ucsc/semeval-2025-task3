Yes, corn salad (Valerianella locusta) is an annual Salad plant that does produce flowers. The plant grows to a height of about 30 to 40 cm and has small, delicate leaves that are used in salads. In the summer, it produces small, white flowers in cymes, which are clusters of flowers. Corn salad is cultivated for its leaves and is often used in green salads, but it does indeed have flowers that grow in a cyme formation.
