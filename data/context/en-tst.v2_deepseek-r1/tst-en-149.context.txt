The population of La Belli√®re, Seine-Maritime is approximately 53 people, as of the latest available estimates. The area is a small commune in the Normandy region of France, and such a low population is typical for many rural French villages. If you need more up-to-date or detailed information, I recommend checking the latest data from the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) or local governmental sources.
