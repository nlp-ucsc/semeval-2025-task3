The Amyema quandang, commonly known as the Quandong, is a species of plant in the family Loranthaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Australia. The fruit of the Quandong is known to be eaten by various birds, but one of the most commonly associated birds with this plant is the Spiny-cheeked Honeyeater (Acanthagenys rufogularis). This bird feeds on the nectar and fruit of the Quandong, playing an important role in dispersing its seeds.

Additionally, other birds such as the Brown Falcon (Falco berigora), the Australian Magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), and various species of parrots and cockatoos may also consume the fruit of the Amyema quandang. These birds contribute to the spread and germination of the Quandong seeds by depositing them in new locations, often in nutrient-rich soil near their roosting sites.

It's worth noting that the Quandong fruit is also an important food source for several indigenous Australian communities, who have traditionally used it as a food and medicine for centuries.
