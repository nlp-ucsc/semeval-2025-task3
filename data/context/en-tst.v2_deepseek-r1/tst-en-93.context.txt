Lesser bamboo rats, scientific name * Cannomys badius*, are not currently considered endangered. They are relatively common and have a wide distribution across their range, which includes parts of South Asia and Southeast Asia. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), they are classified as "Least Concern." This classification suggests that they are not threatened with extinction at the global level, and their populations are stable in many areas. However, local threats such as habitat loss and hunting could affect specific populations, but these do not currently pose a significant risk to the species as a whole. Conserving their habitats and monitoring their populations remain important steps to ensure the continued stability of lesser bamboo rat populations.
