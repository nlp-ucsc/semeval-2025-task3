Yes, there are several notable Anglo-Irish mathematicians who have made significant contributions to their field. Here are a few examples:

1. **William Rowan Hamilton** (1805–1865): Although born in Dublin, Hamilton is often associated with both Irish and Scottish heritage. He is best known for his work in mathematics and physics, particularly his development of Hamiltonian mechanics and the invention of quaternions.

2. **George Gabriel Stokes** (1819–1903): Born in Skreen, County Sligo, Ireland, Stokes made significant contributions to fluid dynamics, mathematics, and physics. He is best known for Stokes' theorem and his work on the Navier-Stokes equations.

3. **John Casey** (1820–1891): From County Kerry, Casey contributed extensively to geometry, particularly in the field of circle geometry. His work on circles and their properties led to the establishment of several important theorems.

4. **James MacCullagh** (1809–1847): A mathematician and physicist from County Antrim, MacCullagh is known for his work on the theory of light and the development of the theory of wave optics.

These mathematicians showcase the rich intellectual heritage of the Anglo-Irish community in mathematics.
