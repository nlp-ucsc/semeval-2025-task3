The British commander during the Battle of Long Island, which occurred on August 27, 1776, was General William Howe and his brother Admiral Richard Howe. General William Howe led the ground forces, while Admiral Howe commanded the naval forces. However, the overall strategy and coordination during the battle were a combined effort between the two brothers. The battle was part of the New York Campaign during the American Revolutionary War.
