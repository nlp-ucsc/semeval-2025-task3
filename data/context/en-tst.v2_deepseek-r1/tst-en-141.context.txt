The Autonomous Province of Korçë was a short-lived administrative division in southern Albania, existing from 1916 to 1920. It was established during World War I under French protection, with Korçë as its capital. The province operated autonomously, maintaining Albanian language and culture while having some self-governance. However, it was reintegrated into Albania in 1920.
