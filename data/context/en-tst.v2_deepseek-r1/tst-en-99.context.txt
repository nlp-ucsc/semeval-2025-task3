Fredrikstad Fotballklubb, a Norwegian football club, has changed its home ground stadium over the years. The team played at the old Fredrikstad Stadion for many decades. However, in 2007, they moved to a new stadium called Fredrikstad Stadion. This new stadium was built to accommodate more spectators and meet modern football standards.
