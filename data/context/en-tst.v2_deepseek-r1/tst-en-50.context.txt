John Davison Rockefeller IV, also known as Jay Rockefeller, is the son of John D. Rockefeller III. Jay Rockefeller served as the U.S. Senator from West Virginia from 1985 to 2015. He married Sharon Percy, and they have four children: John Davison Rockefeller V, Valerie Rockefeller, Charles Rockefeller, and Justin Aldrich Rockefeller.

Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller, who was the Vice President of the United States under Gerald Ford, was another son of John D. Rockefeller Jr. His children include Rodman Rockefeller, Ann Rockefeller, Steven Rockefeller, and Roberta Rockefeller.

It's important to note that Laurance Rockefeller was also a member of the Rockefeller family, but I don't have specific information on his children. For more details about Laurance Rockefeller, you may want to refer to a reliable source or biography.
