Paul Egede was sent to Greenland for his missionary work. He was a Norwegian missionary and the first to bring Christianity to the Inuit people of Greenland. Egede arrived in Greenland in 1721 and established the first permanent Danish-Norwegian mission there. He is often referred to as the "Apostle of Greenland" due to his significant role in spreading Christianity and his contributions to the local culture and language.
