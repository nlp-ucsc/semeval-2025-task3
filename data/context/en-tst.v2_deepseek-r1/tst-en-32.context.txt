Air France Flight 296Q was an experimental flight that crashed on June 26, 1988, during an air show in Habsheim, France. The aircraft, an Airbus A320, struck trees and crashed into a forest, killing three people and injuring many others. The crash was due to a combination of pilot error, poor visibility, and a miscalculation of the plane's altitude. It remains one of the first and most significant crashes involving an A320.
