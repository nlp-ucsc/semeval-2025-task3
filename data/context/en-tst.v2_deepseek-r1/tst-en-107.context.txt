As of the most recent information available to me, which is up to July 2024, the mayor of Jonquery, a commune in the Marne department in the Grand Est region of France, is not immediately available in my current data. Municipal elections in France, including those for mayors, can vary, and specific details about local officials might change after my last update.

For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking the official website of the Jonquery commune or contacting the local municipal office directly. They will be able to provide you with the current mayor's name and any other relevant details. Additionally, local news sources or official government websites often list the latest information on elected officials.
