The dry boiling point of DOT 5 brake fluid is 180°C (356°F). This refers to the temperature at which the brake fluid begins to boil in its original, unopened state or in a system that is free from moisture. DOT 5 brake fluid is typically silicone-based and is known for its high boiling point, which makes it suitable for high-temperature braking applications. However, unlike glycol-based brake fluids (such as DOT 3, DOT 4, and DOT 5.1), DOT 5 does not absorb water, which can be both an advantage and a disadvantage depending on the application. Always check your vehicle's manufacturer recommendations before selecting a brake fluid type.
