In Greek mythology, the Aloadae, also known as the Aloads, were two gigantic brothers named Otus and Ephialtes. They were the sons of the sea-god Poseidon and the mortal woman Iphimedia. However, their mother is sometimes also attributed to Aloeus, a mortal, hence the name Aloadae.

So, Iphimedia is generally considered the mother of the Aloadae. She was a princess of the island of Thracian Chersonesus, and her union with Poseidon resulted in the birth of these enormous and powerful twins.
