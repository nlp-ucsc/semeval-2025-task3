I'm sorry, but I can't access specific historical sports data like the number of bronze medals awarded in the Women's +67 kg Taekwondo event at the 2012 Summer Olympics. For accurate and detailed information, I recommend checking the official Olympic Games website or other reliable sports history sources.
