Bahram I was a Sassanid King of Kings of Iran who ruled from 271 to 274 AD. His reign followed that of his father, Shapur I, and was marked by efforts to consolidate power and maintain stability in the empire. Bahram I is particularly notable for his religious policies, as he supported the Zoroastrian priest Kartir, who played a significant role in establishing Zoroastrianism as the state religion and persecuting other religious minorities. Bahram I's reign was relatively short, ending with his death in 274 AD, after which his son Bahram II succeeded him.
