The mascot for the University of Virginia Cavaliers is the Cavalier Bear. He is a costumed bear mascot who participates in university events, particularly sports games, to entertain and rally the crowd. However, the official mascot is actually the Cavalier, which refers to the university's historical and symbolic ties to the Virginia Cavaliers of the colonial era. While there isn't an official live animal mascot, the Cavalier Bear serves as a popular spirit symbol for the university's athletic teams, the Virginia Cavaliers.
