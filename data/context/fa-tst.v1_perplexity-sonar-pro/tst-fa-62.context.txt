Based on the search results, the literacy rate in Iran in the year 1400 (2021-2022) was reported as follows:

1. According to the head of the Literacy Movement Organization, the overall literacy rate in Iran reached 90.5% in 1400 [9][2].

2. For the age group of 10-49 years old, the literacy rate was estimated to be 97% at the end of 1399 and beginning of 1400 [7].

3. Breaking it down by gender for the 10-49 age group:
   - The literacy rate for women was estimated at 96%
   - The literacy rate for men was estimated at 98% [7]

4. For urban and rural areas in the 10-49 age group:
   - The literacy rate in urban areas was estimated at 98%
   - The literacy rate in rural areas was estimated at 92% [7]

5. However, it's important to note that there are some discrepancies in the reported illiteracy rates. While some sources claim a 90.5% literacy rate (implying a 9.5% illiteracy rate), others report a 12% illiteracy rate for the same year [1].

6. The literacy rate varies significantly across different provinces. For example, Tehran province had the lowest illiteracy rate at 6.6%, while Kurdistan province had the highest at around 18% [8].

7. It's worth mentioning that there are ongoing efforts to improve literacy rates, especially among the 10-19 age group, where approximately 150,000 individuals were reported as illiterate [7].

These figures demonstrate that while Iran has made significant progress in improving literacy rates since the 1979 revolution, there are still challenges, particularly in certain regions and demographic groups. The government continues to work towards increasing literacy rates across the country.
