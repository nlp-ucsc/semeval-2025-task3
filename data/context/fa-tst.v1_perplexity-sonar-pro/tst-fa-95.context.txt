1. According to the Ministry of Health, 30,692 people died due to air pollution in Iran in the previous year (1402 Iranian calendar, equivalent to 2023-2024)[1][6]. This represents an increase from 26,307 deaths reported in the year before that.

2. The head of the Air Pollution Research Center at Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Mohammad Sadegh Hassanvand, stated that about 50,000 deaths annually in Iran are attributable to air pollution[4][10]. This figure represents approximately 12% of all annual deaths in the country.

3. Another estimate suggests that around 45,000 people die annually in Iran due to causes related to air pollution[7]. Of this number, about 9,000 deaths are reported to occur in Tehran alone.

4. The Minister of Health mentioned that air pollution is responsible for 15% of deaths among children under 5 years old in Iran[8].

However, the consensus among these sources is that air pollution is a significant cause of mortality in Iran, responsible for tens of thousands of deaths annually. The trend also seems to be worsening, with more recent estimates generally higher than older ones.
