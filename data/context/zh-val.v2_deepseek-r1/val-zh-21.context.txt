修辞学在汉语中的语源可以追溯到“修辞”这一词汇。“修”Originally, it means "to decorate" or "to embellish," and "辞" refers to "words" or "language." Together, the term "修辞" encompasses the study and art of using language effectively and persuasively. The introduction of Western rhetoric, or "修辞学," into Chinese academia was influenced by the importation of Western philosophical and literary theories during the late Qing dynasty and the early Republican period. This blending of traditional Chinese "修辞" with Western "rhetoric" gave rise to the modern academic discipline known as "修辞学" in Chinese.
