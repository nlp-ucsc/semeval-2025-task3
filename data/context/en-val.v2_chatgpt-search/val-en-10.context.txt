Childbirth is typically divided into three stages:

1. First Stage: Labor
 - Early (Latent) Phase: The cervix begins to thin (efface) and open (dilate) up to about 6 centimeters. Contractions are mild and irregular during this phase.
 - Active Phase: The cervix dilates from approximately 6 to 10 centimeters. Contractions become stronger, more regular, and closer together. [MAYO CLINIC]
2. Second Stage: Delivery of the Baby
 - This stage starts when the cervix is fully dilated at 10 centimeters and ends with the birth of the baby. The mother experiences strong contractions and the urge to push as the baby moves through the birth canal. [WEBMD]
3. Third Stage: Delivery of the Placenta
 - After the baby is born, contractions continue to help expel the placenta from the uterus. This stage typically lasts a few minutes but can extend up to 30 minutes. [NHS]
 - Some medical sources also recognize a fourth stage, known as the recovery stage, which occurs in the hours immediately following the delivery of the placenta. During this time, the mother's body begins to recover, and healthcare providers monitor for any complications. [MEDICINENET]

Understanding these stages can help expectant mothers and their support teams prepare for the labor and delivery process.
