In Bruce Sterling's "Schismatrix," humanity has diverged into two primary factions:

Shapers: This group focuses on enhancing human capabilities through genetic engineering and specialized psychological training. Originating from colonies orbiting Jupiter and Saturn, Shapers emphasize biological modifications to achieve their vision of human evolution. [WIKIPEDIA]

Mechanists: In contrast, Mechanists pursue human advancement via cybernetic augmentation and external technological enhancements. They modify their bodies with computer software and mechanical alterations, aiming to transcend human limitations through machinery. The Mechanists primarily inhabit colonies in the asteroid belt.

These factions represent opposing ideologies on human evolution, leading to prolonged conflict over the future direction of humanity.
