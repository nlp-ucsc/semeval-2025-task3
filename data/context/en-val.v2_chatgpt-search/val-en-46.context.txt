Two Roman emperors were born in Lugdunum (modern-day Lyon, France):

Claudius (Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus): Born on August 1, 10 BC, Claudius was the first Roman emperor born outside Italy. He reigned from AD 41 to 54 and is noted for expanding Roman rule in North Africa and making Britain a province. [ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA]

Caracalla (Marcus Aurelius Antoninus): Born on April 4, AD 188, Caracalla ruled as emperor from AD 198 to 217. He is known for the Constitutio Antoniniana, which granted Roman citizenship to all free men within the Empire, and for commissioning the Baths of Caracalla in Rome. [WIKIPEDIA]

Both emperors' births in Lugdunum highlight the city's significance in the Roman Empire.
