Zhejiang cuisine, one of China's Eight Culinary Traditions, comprises four distinct regional styles:

Hangzhou Style: Known for its rich variety and the prominent use of bamboo shoots, Hangzhou cuisine emphasizes freshness and lightness. Common cooking methods include stir-frying, steaming, and pot-roasting, resulting in dishes that are elegantly presented. [CHINA TOURS]

Shaoxing Style: Specializing in poultry and freshwater fish, Shaoxing cuisine is characterized by mild and refreshing flavors. Ingredients such as fish, shrimp, poultry, beans, and bamboo shoots are often steamed or stewed with the famous Shaoxing rice wine, imparting a distinctive aroma and taste. [CHINA TOURS]

Ningbo Style: Focusing on seafood, Ningbo cuisine places a strong emphasis on freshness and tends to be saltier compared to other Zhejiang styles. The cooking techniques—quick-frying, stir-frying, deep-frying, simmering, and steaming—ensure that the seafood remains tender and flavorful. [CHINA TOURS]

Wenzhou Style (Ou Cuisine): Also known as Ou cuisine, Wenzhou style is renowned for its extensive use of seafood, poultry, and livestock. With over 30 different cooking methods and more than 250 seafood dish varieties, Wenzhou cuisine is noted for its light flavors and the importance placed on cutting techniques and aesthetic presentation.
