Yes, a Graphics Address Remapping Table (GART) is a type of Inputâ€“Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU). The GART facilitates Direct Memory Access (DMA) for graphics cards by mapping device-visible virtual addresses to physical addresses, enabling efficient data transfer between the GPU and system memory. This functionality is characteristic of an IOMMU, which manages memory addresses for I/O devices to ensure proper access and protection.
