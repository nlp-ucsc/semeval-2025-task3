Count Carl Löwenhielm (1772–1861) was the illegitimate son of King Charles XIII of Sweden and Augusta von Fersen. At the time of Carl's birth, Augusta was married to Fredrik Adolf Löwenhielm, the Chancellor of the Royal Court, who acknowledged Carl as his own. This acknowledgment provided Carl with the Löwenhielm surname and integrated him into the noble Löwenhielm family.
