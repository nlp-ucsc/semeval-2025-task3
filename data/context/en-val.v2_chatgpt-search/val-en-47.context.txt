Bischofsheim was a constituent community of the city of Mainz from January 1, 1930, until 1945. During this period, it was incorporated into Mainz along with other neighboring communities. However, after World War II, the American and French occupying forces redefined administrative boundaries, leading to Bischofsheim's separation from Mainz. Consequently, Bischofsheim became an independent municipality within the Gro√ü-Gerau district of Hesse.
