The term "western oriole" can refer to two different species: the Western Oriole (Oriolus brachyrynchus), native to Africa, and Bullock's Oriole (Icterus bullockii), found in North America. Western Oriole (Oriolus brachyrynchus): This African species measures approximately 21 centimeters (8.3 inches) in length and weighs between 42 to 57 grams (1.5 to 2.0 ounces). [WIKIPEDIA]
