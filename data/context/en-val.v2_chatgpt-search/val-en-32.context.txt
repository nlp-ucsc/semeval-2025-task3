Windows Neptune was a version of Microsoft Windows under development in 1999, intended to be the first consumer-oriented operating system built on the Windows NT codebase. However, it was never officially released. Only one alpha build, version 5111, was distributed to testers under a non-disclosure agreement and later became available on beta collector sites. In early 2000, Microsoft merged the Neptune project with another project codenamed Odyssey to create a new project called Whistler, which was eventually released as Windows XP in 2001.
