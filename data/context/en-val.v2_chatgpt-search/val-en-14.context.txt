Bleeding Kansas refers to a series of violent confrontations between pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions in the Kansas Territory between 1854 and 1859. [ENCYCLOPÃ†DIA BRITANNICA] This period of unrest was a precursor to the American Civil War, highlighting the deep national divisions over slavery. The conflict was ignited by the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which allowed settlers in those territories to decide the legality of slavery through popular sovereignty. [HISTORY] This led to a rush of both pro-slavery and anti-slavery settlers into Kansas, resulting in violent clashes as each side sought to influence the state's stance on slavery.
