Dr. William John Little, an English surgeon in the 19th century, is recognized as the first physician to extensively study and treat cerebral palsy. Drawing from his own experience with a clubfoot, he pioneered research into neuromuscular disorders and, in 1861, provided the first medical description of spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy. His work was so influential that spastic diplegia was initially known as "Little's Disease." [WIKIPEDIA]

Dr. Little's contributions laid the foundation for understanding and managing cerebral palsy, bridging the gap between neurology and orthopedics. His innovative techniques in orthopedic surgery continue to influence modern treatments for neuromuscular conditions.
