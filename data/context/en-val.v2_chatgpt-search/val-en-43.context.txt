In a case-control study, two groups are compared:
1. Cases: Individuals who have the condition or outcome of interest.
2. Controls: Individuals who do not have the condition or outcome.

This design allows researchers to assess whether certain exposures or factors are more prevalent among those with the condition compared to those without it.
