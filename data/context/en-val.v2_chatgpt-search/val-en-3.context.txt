Not all arthropods possess antennae. While many arthropods, such as insects and crustaceans, have one or two pairs of antennae used for sensory functions, certain groups lack them entirely. For instance, chelicerates—which include spiders, scorpions, and horseshoe crabs—do not have antennae. Instead, they have specialized appendages like chelicerae and pedipalps that serve various roles, including feeding and sensory perception. [WIKIPEDIA] Similarly, proturans, a group of small, soil-dwelling arthropods, also lack antennae.
