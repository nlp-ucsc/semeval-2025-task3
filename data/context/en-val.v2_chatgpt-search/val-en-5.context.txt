The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) aims to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable." [SDGS KNOWLEDGE HUB] This goal emphasizes the importance of urban areas that provide equitable access to services, ensure safety, promote resilience against disasters, and operate sustainably to meet the needs of current and future generations.

SDG 11 encompasses several specific targets, including:
 - Safe and affordable housing: Ensuring access to adequate, safe, and affordable housing for all.
 - Sustainable transport systems: Providing access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems, with special attention to the needs of vulnerable populations.
 - Inclusive urbanization: Enhancing inclusive and sustainable urbanization and participatory, integrated, and sustainable human settlement planning and management.
 - Protection of cultural and natural heritage: Strengthening efforts to protect and safeguard the world's cultural and natural heritage.
 - Disaster risk reduction: Significantly reducing the number of deaths and people affected by disasters, including water-related disasters, with a focus on protecting the poor and vulnerable.
 - Environmental impact reduction: Reducing the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and waste management.
 - Access to green and public spaces: Providing universal access to safe, inclusive, and accessible green and public spaces, particularly for women, children, older persons, and persons with disabilities.

By addressing these targets, SDG 11 seeks to create urban environments that are equitable, safe, resilient, and sustainable for all residents.
