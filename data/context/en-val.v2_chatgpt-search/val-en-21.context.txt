Yes, kremlins and detinets are similar, as both terms refer to fortified central complexes in historic Russian cities. The term "kremlin" (Russian: кремль) is widely recognized and often associated with the Moscow Kremlin, but it applies to major fortresses in various Russian cities. "Detinets" (Russian: детинец) is an older term used in ancient Rus' to describe a city's central fortified area, akin to a citadel. Over time, "kremlin" became the more prevalent term, replacing "detinets" in many regions.
