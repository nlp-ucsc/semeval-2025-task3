Garajonay National Park's name comes from Alto de Garajonay, which is the highest peak on the island of La Gomera[1][2]. The park is named after this rock formation, which reaches an elevation of 1,487 meters (4,879 feet) above sea level[2].

The name "Garajonay" itself has its origins in Guanche folklore, specifically from the legend of Gara and Jonay[2]. According to the legend:

- Gara was a princess from Agulo on La Gomera
- Jonay was the son of the Guanche king (mencey) of Adeje on Tenerife
- The two fell in love during a festival
- Their romance was opposed due to a perceived bad omen (an eruption of the Teide volcano)
- The lovers fled and were pursued
- Trapped on a mountain, they decided to take their own lives

This tragic love story, reminiscent of Romeo and Juliet, is commemorated in the name of the park and its highest peak[2]. The legend reflects the cultural heritage of the Guanche people, who were the original inhabitants of the Canary Islands before European colonization.

The park, which was declared a national park in 1981 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986, encompasses this peak and the surrounding area, covering about 40 square kilometers (15 square miles) of La Gomera's central and northern regions[1][2].
