Kyriakos Mitsotakis became Prime Minister of Greece on two occasions:

1. First term: July 8, 2019 - May 24, 2023

Mitsotakis first became Prime Minister of Greece on July 8, 2019, after his New Democracy party won a decisive victory in the 2019 Greek legislative election[1][4]. He led his party to a majority in parliament, securing 158 seats out of 300[1].

2. Second term: June 26, 2023 - present

Following the May 2023 Greek legislative election where no party won an outright majority, Mitsotakis called for a snap election in June 2023[1]. In this second election, he once again led his party to a majority and was sworn in as Prime Minister on June 26, 2023[1][4].

Between these two terms, there was a brief period (May 24, 2023 - June 26, 2023) where Ioannis Sarmas served as a caretaker Prime Minister, as required by the Greek constitution when no coalition government could be formed after the May 2023 election[1].

Mitsotakis's political career leading up to his premiership included serving as the Minister of Administrative Reform from 2013 to 2015 and becoming the leader of the New Democracy party in 2016[1][2]. His rise to power was marked by his advocacy for pro-business policies, anti-corruption measures, and a move towards more centrist positions within his traditionally right-wing party[6].
