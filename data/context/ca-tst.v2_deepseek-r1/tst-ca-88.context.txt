I'm unable to provide specific financial data for individuals or specific locations, especially from years as far back as 2009, due to privacy concerns and data limitations.

However, I can guide you on how you might find this information:

1. **Local Government Office**: Contact the local government or town hall of Herpy-l'Arlésienne. They may have access to historical tax data.

2. **National Statistics Office**: In France, the INSEE (Institut National de la Statistique et des Études Économiques) collects various economic and demographic data. They might have regional or departmental data that could be useful.

3. **Online Resources**: Some websites or academic studies may have compiled average income data from past years. You might need to search for specific reports or databases.

### Additional Considerations:
- The concept of "median annual income" might not be exactly the same as "media anual d'ingressos fiscals per persona."
- Taxable income can vary significantly from actual income, as it depends on deductions, exemptions, etc.
-Privacy laws may prevent the disclosure of specific individual or small group data.

If you have access to specific sources or databases, consulting them directly is your best bet.
