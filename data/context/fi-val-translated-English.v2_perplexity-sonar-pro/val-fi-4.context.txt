During the 2008 European Championship, Red Bull Arena was known as EM-Stadion Wals-Siezenheim[1][4]. This name was specifically used for the tournament to comply with UEFA regulations that prohibit corporate sponsorship in stadium names during their events. The "EM" in the name stands for "Europameisterschaft," which is German for "European Championship"[1].

Some key details about the stadium's use during Euro 2008:

1. It hosted three group stage matches, all involving Greece[1].

2. The stadium's capacity was expanded from its original 18,200 to over 30,000 specifically to accommodate the tournament[1][6].

3. After the tournament, the expanded capacity was retained for use by FC Red Bull Salzburg[1].

4. It was one of four venues in Austria used for the championship[6].

The temporary renaming of stadiums for major tournaments is a common practice to avoid conflicts with sponsorship agreements and to maintain a neutral branding during international events.
