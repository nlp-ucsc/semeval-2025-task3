A metallic bond is a type of chemical bonding that occurs between metal atoms in a solid or liquid metal. It is characterized by the following key features:

1. Electron delocalization: In metallic bonding, the valence electrons of metal atoms are not confined to specific atoms or bonds. Instead, they form a "sea" or "cloud" of delocalized electrons that can move freely throughout the metal structure[1][2].

2. Electrostatic attraction: The metallic bond arises from the electrostatic attractive force between the positively charged metal ions (cations) and the negatively charged sea of delocalized electrons[5][2].

3. Lattice structure: Metal atoms in a solid typically form a closely packed, ordered array or lattice of positive ions[1][2].

4. Non-directional bonding: Unlike covalent bonds, metallic bonds are not directional, which contributes to the unique properties of metals[5].

## Properties of Metallic Bonding

Metallic bonding imparts several characteristic properties to metals:

1. Electrical conductivity: The delocalized electrons can easily move through the metal structure, allowing for excellent electrical conductivity[3][6].

2. Thermal conductivity: Metals are good conductors of heat due to the mobility of electrons and the transfer of kinetic energy[4].

3. Malleability and ductility: The non-directional nature of metallic bonds allows metal atoms to slide past one another without breaking the bonds, making metals malleable and ductile[3][6].

4. Lustre: The high density of electrons at the surface of metals causes incoming light to be reflected, giving metals their characteristic shiny appearance[4].

5. High melting and boiling points: Strong metallic bonds require significant energy to break, resulting in generally high melting and boiling points for metals[5].

## Factors Affecting Metallic Bond Strength

The strength of metallic bonds depends on several factors:

1. Number of delocalized electrons: More delocalized electrons generally lead to stronger metallic bonds[3].

2. Charge of the metal cation: A higher positive charge on the metal ion results in stronger attraction to the electron sea[3].

3. Size of the cation: Smaller cations typically form stronger metallic bonds due to increased effective nuclear charge[3].

In summary, metallic bonding is a unique type of chemical bonding that explains many of the distinctive properties of metals, such as their conductivity, malleability, and lustre. It involves the collective sharing of delocalized electrons among positively charged metal ions in a lattice structure.
