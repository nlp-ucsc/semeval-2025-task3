The Mir space station was based on and evolved from the earlier Soviet Salyut space station series[1][2]. Specifically:

Mir represented the third generation of Soviet space stations, following the Salyut series[1]. The Salyut stations were the first generation of space stations, consisting of single-module designs. The second generation included Salyut 6 and Salyut 7, which had two docking ports to allow resupply missions[2].

Mir's core module was an improved design based on the DOS-17K space stations used in the later Salyut program[10]. It was authorized in 1976 to create an enhanced model of the Salyut stations[10].

Key improvements in Mir over the Salyut series included:

1. Modular design: Mir was the first modular space station, allowing for expansion and greater flexibility[1][2].

2. Multiple docking ports: The core module was equipped with six docking ports, compared to the two ports on later Salyut stations[1][10].

3. Longer operational lifespan: While Salyut stations typically operated for months to a few years, Mir was designed for long-term use and ultimately remained in orbit for 15 years[1][3].

4. Enhanced systems: Mir incorporated improved technologies such as the Salyut 5B digital flight control computer, Kurs automatic rendezvous system, and more advanced life support systems[10].

By building upon the experience gained from the Salyut program, the Soviet Union was able to create a more capable and long-lasting space station in Mir, which served as a crucial step towards the development of the International Space Station.
