Al-Khobar was established as a result of several key factors:

1. Migration of the Dawasir tribe: In 1923, members of the Dawasir tribe moved to the area that would become Al-Khobar, fleeing from British persecution in Bahrain. They settled there with the permission of King Abdulaziz Al Saud[1][4].

2. Discovery of oil: The discovery of oil in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia in the mid-20th century was a crucial factor in Al-Khobar's establishment and rapid development[1][3].

3. Need for a port: With the discovery of oil, Al-Khobar was transformed from a small fishing village into an industrial port. It became a key location for exporting petroleum, particularly in the early days of Saudi Aramco[3][4].

4. Commercial development: The oil industry sparked significant commercial activity in the area, leading to the official founding of the municipality of Al-Khobar in 1942[3][6].

5. Strategic location: Al-Khobar's position on the coast of the Arabian Gulf made it an ideal location for both industrial and commercial development[3].

6. Planned urban development: Based on a city plan dating back to 1942, Al-Khobar was carefully designed with neatly divided residential squares and evenly transected roads, indicating its important role in the national economy[3].

As a result of these factors, Al-Khobar evolved from a modest fishing hamlet into a thriving commercial and industrial center, becoming an integral part of the Eastern Province's economic landscape and one of the key cities in Saudi Arabia's oil-driven development.
