I apologize, but there appears to be a misunderstanding in your question. There is no character called "the Judge" trying to cleanse Hell's Kitchen in the TV series The Punisher.

The Punisher, also known as Frank Castle, is the main character who engages in violent vigilantism to clean up crime in New York City, including Hell's Kitchen. However, he is not a judge, but rather a former Marine turned vigilante after the murder of his family[2].

The confusion may stem from the fact that Hell's Kitchen is a prominent setting in both The Punisher and Daredevil series, which are part of the Marvel Netflix universe. In Daredevil, the main character Matt Murdock is a lawyer by day and vigilante by night, working to protect Hell's Kitchen from crime and corruption[6].

The Punisher's methods are much more extreme than Daredevil's. While Daredevil refuses to kill, Frank Castle (The Punisher) believes in violently eliminating criminals. This creates a moral conflict between the two characters when they interact[2][4].

If you're looking for information about efforts to clean up Hell's Kitchen in these series, it's worth noting that multiple characters, including Daredevil, The Punisher, and even some of the villains like Wilson Fisk, claim to be working towards improving the neighborhood, albeit through very different methods.
