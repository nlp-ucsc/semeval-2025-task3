A sustainable city is an urban area designed and managed to minimize negative environmental impacts while promoting social and economic well-being for its residents. It aims to meet the needs of the present population without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs[1][3].

Key characteristics of a sustainable city include:

1. Environmental consciousness: Sustainable cities prioritize reducing their ecological footprint through various means:

   - Efficient use of resources and energy, including adoption of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power[2]
   - Waste reduction and management, emphasizing recycling and composting[3]
   - Green infrastructure and spaces, such as parks, gardens, and urban forests[1][2]
   - Sustainable transportation options, including efficient public transit, cycling infrastructure, and pedestrian-friendly design[2][3]

2. Economic sustainability: These cities promote:

   - Local economies and businesses[4]
   - Green jobs and industries
   - Circular economy principles to ensure efficient resource use[3]

3. Social equity and inclusivity:

   - Affordable and clean housing for all socioeconomic groups[2]
   - Equal access to essential services and opportunities
   - Promotion of community engagement and participation[2]

4. Resilience:

   - Ability to adapt to and mitigate climate change impacts[1]
   - Disaster preparedness and risk reduction strategies

5. Smart city integration:

   - Use of technology and data to improve city management and services
   - Implementation of smart grids and energy-efficient systems[3]

6. Sustainable urban planning:

   - Mixed-use development to reduce urban sprawl
   - Compact city design to improve efficiency and reduce transportation needs[3]

Sustainable cities aim to create a balance between environmental protection, economic growth, and social well-being. They strive to be self-sufficient in energy production, manage resources efficiently, and provide a high quality of life for their inhabitants while minimizing their impact on the environment[4][5].

By implementing these principles, sustainable cities work towards creating resilient, livable urban environments that can thrive in the long term while addressing global challenges such as climate change, resource depletion, and social inequality.
