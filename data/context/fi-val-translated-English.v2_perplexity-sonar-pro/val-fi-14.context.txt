Jef Raskin studied at multiple universities:

1. Stony Brook University: He received a BA in mathematics and a BS in physics with minors in philosophy and music from Stony Brook University (formerly known as the State University of New York at Stony Brook)[1][2][6].

2. Pennsylvania State University: After Stony Brook, Raskin earned a master's degree in computer science from Pennsylvania State University in 1967[1][2]. He had initially enrolled in a PhD program in mathematical logic at Penn State, but switched to computer science due to differences with his advisor[1].

3. University of California, San Diego (UCSD): Following his time at Penn State, Raskin enrolled in a graduate music program at UCSD[1]. However, he did not complete this program and instead became a professor in the Visual Arts department at UCSD, teaching there from 1968 to 1974[1][3].

It's worth noting that while Raskin completed coursework for PhD-level studies at both Penn State and UCSD, he did not ultimately receive a PhD due to various circumstances, including accreditation issues at Penn State and administrative decisions at UCSD[1][3].
