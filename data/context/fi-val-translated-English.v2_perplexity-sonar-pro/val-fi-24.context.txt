Alfredo Cristiano Keil (1850-1907) was indeed the composer of the Portuguese national anthem, "A Portuguesa"[1][7]. He was a multifaceted artist who made significant contributions to Portuguese culture as a composer, painter, poet, archaeologist, and art collector[1].

Born in Lisbon to parents of German origin, Keil showed an early interest in both music and painting. At just 12 years old, he composed his first musical work, "Pensée Musicale," which he dedicated to his mother[1].

As a composer, Keil gained prominence with his operas, including "Donna Bianca" (1888), "Irene" (1893), and "Serrana" (1899), the latter being considered the best Portuguese opera of its time[1]. He was well-connected in the European music scene, maintaining contact with renowned composers like Giuseppe Verdi, Giacomo Puccini, and Jules Massenet[1].

However, Keil's most enduring musical legacy is undoubtedly "A Portuguesa." He composed this patriotic song in 1890 in response to the British ultimatum to Portugal regarding territorial control in Africa[3]. The lyrics were written by poet Henrique Lopes de Mendonça[7]. Initially created as a protest march, the song gained popularity and became a symbol of Portuguese patriotism and republican sentiment[3].

"A Portuguesa" was officially adopted as the national anthem of Portugal on October 5, 1910, following the establishment of the Portuguese Republic[7]. The anthem's powerful lyrics and stirring melody continue to evoke national pride and unity among the Portuguese people to this day.

Keil's contribution to Portuguese culture extends beyond music. He was also a respected painter, known for his romantic landscapes and intimate scenes[1]. His artistic versatility and patriotic compositions have secured his place as a significant figure in Portuguese cultural history.
