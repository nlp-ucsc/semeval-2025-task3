Chris Claremont is particularly known for his legendary run on Uncanny X-Men. He wrote the series for an unprecedented 16-year stint from 1975 to 1991, which is considered one of the most influential and important runs in comic book history[1][4]. During this time, Claremont transformed the X-Men from a lackluster, underperforming series into Marvel's best-selling and most popular title[3][4].

Some key aspects of Claremont's X-Men run include:

1. Character creation: He co-created numerous iconic X-Men characters like Rogue, Psylocke, Kitty Pryde, Phoenix, Mystique, Gambit, and many others[4].

2. Classic storylines: Claremont wrote many famous X-Men stories, including "The Dark Phoenix Saga" and "Days of Future Past"[4].

3. Character development: He is credited with developing strong female characters and introducing complex literary themes into superhero narratives[4].

4. Commercial success: Under Claremont's writing, X-Men became the best-selling comic book in the world[4].

5. Spinoff series: He also launched and wrote successful X-Men spinoffs like The New Mutants and Excalibur[4][5].

6. Record-breaking: Claremont co-wrote X-Men #1 in 1991, which remains the best-selling comic book of all time, with over 8.1 million copies sold[4].

Claremont's work on X-Men is so significant that his papers and archives related to the series are now collected in the Rare Book and Manuscript Library of Columbia University, highlighting the cultural and literary importance of his contributions to the medium[3][7].
