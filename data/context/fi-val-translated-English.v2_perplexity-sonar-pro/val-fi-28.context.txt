Muhammad bin Qasim was born on December 31, 695 AD[2][3][4]. He was born in Taif, located in the Hejaz region of western Arabia, which is part of present-day Saudi Arabia[3][4]. 

Some key details about Muhammad bin Qasim's birth and early life:

- His full name was Muḥammad ibn al-Qāsim al-Thaqafī in Arabic (محمد بن القاسم الثقفي)[3].

- He was born into a family with close connections to the ruling Umayyad Caliphate[2].

- His uncle Al-Hajjaj bin Yusuf, who was the powerful governor of Iraq, played a significant role in shaping Muhammad's early career and military training[2].

Muhammad bin Qasim would go on to become a renowned military commander at a very young age, leading the Muslim conquest of Sindh when he was only 17 years old in 711-712 AD[1][2]. His birth in 695 AD set the stage for his meteoric rise and brief but impactful military career that ended with his death in 715 AD at the age of 19 or 20[3][4].
