The only family of powdery mildew fungi is Erysiphaceae[1][2]. This family belongs to the order Erysiphales, which is part of the class Leotiomycetes in the phylum Ascomycota[2][8].

Erysiphaceae contains all the fungi responsible for causing powdery mildew diseases on plants. Some key characteristics of this family include:

1. Obligate parasites: These fungi can only grow and reproduce on living plant tissue[3][5].

2. Surface growth: Most powdery mildew fungi grow on the surface of the host plant, forming a white to grayish powdery coating[1][3].

3. Specialized structures: They produce haustoria (feeding structures) that penetrate host cells to absorb nutrients[4].

4. Asexual and sexual reproduction: They can reproduce asexually through conidia (spores) and sexually by forming cleistothecia (fruiting bodies)[1][3].

5. Wide host range: Members of Erysiphaceae can infect thousands of plant species across various families[4].

6. Multiple genera: The family includes several important genera such as Erysiphe, Podosphaera, Golovinomyces, Leveillula, and Phyllactinia, among others[5][7].

While there are many species of powdery mildew fungi (estimates suggest around 700 species), they are all classified within this single family, Erysiphaceae[4]. This family's unique position as the sole family in the order Erysiphales underscores its significance in fungal taxonomy and plant pathology.
