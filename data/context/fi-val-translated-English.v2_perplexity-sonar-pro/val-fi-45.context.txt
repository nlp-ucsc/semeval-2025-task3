Susan Mayer lives on Wisteria Lane in the television series Desperate Housewives[1][3]. Wisteria Lane is a fictional street that serves as the central setting for the show. Susan's house is specifically located at 4353 Wisteria Lane[2][3].

Wisteria Lane is depicted as a quiet suburban street with well-maintained homes, typical of an idealized American neighborhood. The street features a cul-de-sac and is home to the main characters of the series, including Susan and her neighbors[6].

Susan's house on Wisteria Lane is described as a pale-yellow Dutch Colonial style home with brown-stone accents and a gambrel roof[8]. This house plays a significant role throughout the series, serving as the backdrop for many of Susan's storylines. She lives there with her daughter Julie for most of the show, and later with her husband Mike Delfino and their son MJ[4].

The exterior scenes of Wisteria Lane, including Susan's house, were actually filmed on Colonial Street within Universal Studios Hollywood[6]. This street was designed to replicate a typical American suburban neighborhood and has been used in various film and television productions.
