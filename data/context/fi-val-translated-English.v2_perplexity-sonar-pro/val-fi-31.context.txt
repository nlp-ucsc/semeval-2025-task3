I apologize, but there appears to be an error in your query. There is no bird species called a "mud crow." The search results provided do not contain any information about a bird by that name. 

The search results primarily discuss various species of crows, including the American Crow, Northwestern Crow, Fish Crow, and Pied Crow. However, none of these are referred to as a "mud crow."

To provide a helpful response, I can offer information on the distribution of some common crow species:

1. American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos):
This species has a wide distribution across North America. It ranges from the Pacific to the Atlantic coast in Canada, through the United States, and into northern Mexico[7]. American Crows are found in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, farmlands, and urban areas[5].

2. Northwestern Crow (now considered part of the American Crow species):
Previously thought to be a separate species, it ranged along the northeastern Pacific Coast from northern Washington to southern Alaska[3]. However, in 2020, it was officially absorbed into the American Crow species[5].

3. Fish Crow (Corvus ossifragus):
This species is native to the east coast of the United States, with its range extending from Maine to Florida. It has been found as far west as Nebraska, Wyoming, Kansas, and Iowa[2].

If you meant to ask about a different species or if you have more specific information about the "mud crow" you're inquiring about, please provide additional details, and I'll be happy to help further.
