No, not all arthropods have antennae. While antennae are a common feature among many arthropod groups, there are some notable exceptions[1][4][6]:

1. Chelicerates: This subphylum of arthropods, which includes spiders, mites, scorpions, and horseshoe crabs, lack antennae[9]. Instead of antennae, chelicerates have specialized appendages called chelicerae, which are often used for feeding or defense[3].

2. Arachnids: As part of the chelicerate subphylum, arachnids (including spiders, scorpions, ticks, and mites) do not possess antennae[6]. They typically have two body segments and four pairs of legs[4].

3. Proturans: These small, soil-dwelling hexapods are an exception among the non-crustacean arthropods, as they lack antennae[1].

Most other major arthropod groups do have antennae, though the number and structure can vary:

- Insects: Have a single pair of antennae[1][7].
- Crustaceans: Possess two pairs of antennae[1][5].
- Myriapods (centipedes and millipedes): Have one pair of antennae[5][7].

Antennae serve various important functions in arthropods that possess them, including:

- Sensing touch, smell, and in some cases, hearing[2].
- Detecting air motion, heat, and vibration[1].
- Aiding in mating practices and locating food sources[1].
- Assisting in flight stabilization for some insects[1].

The presence or absence of antennae, along with other morphological features, is often used in arthropod classification and identification[4][5]. While antennae are a characteristic feature of many arthropods, it's important to remember that exceptions exist within this diverse phylum.
