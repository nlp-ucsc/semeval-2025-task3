Since 2006, Gillette Stadium has consistently used FieldTurf artificial turf surfaces[1][2]. Specifically:

- FieldTurf was initially installed at Gillette Stadium in November 2006, marking the first in-season grass-to-turf conversion in NFL history[6][8].

- The stadium has exclusively utilized FieldTurf products since that 2006 installation[6].

- Over the years, Gillette Stadium has upgraded to newer FieldTurf systems:
  - In 2014, they installed the FieldTurf Revolution system with VersaTile drainage[6][8].
  - In 2017, they upgraded to FieldTurf's latest monofilament technology at the time[1][3].
  - In 2021, a new FieldTurf CORE system was installed[7].
  - Most recently in 2024, Gillette Stadium completed installation of the latest FieldTurf CORE system with multi-layer dual-polymer monofilament fiber[5][10].

- The 2024 season will mark the 19th consecutive season Gillette Stadium has featured FieldTurf surfaces[5][10].

This long-standing relationship with FieldTurf demonstrates the stadium's commitment to providing a high-quality playing surface for both the New England Patriots (NFL) and New England Revolution (MLS) teams that call Gillette Stadium home[1][3][5].
