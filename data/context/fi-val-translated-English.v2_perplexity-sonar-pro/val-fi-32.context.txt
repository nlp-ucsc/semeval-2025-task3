Carl Löwenhielm's father was King Charles XIII of Sweden[2][4][5]. Carl Löwenhielm was born as an illegitimate son to King Charles XIII (who was then Prince Charles, Duke of Södermanland) and Augusta von Fersen[2][4][5]. 

Some key details about Carl Löwenhielm's parentage:

1. His biological father was King Charles XIII of Sweden, who reigned from 1809 to 1818[8].

2. His mother was Augusta von Fersen, who was married to Fredrik Adolf Löwenhielm, the Chancellor of the Royal Court[2][4].

3. Carl Löwenhielm was born on November 3, 1772 in Stockholm, Sweden[4][5].

4. He was the half-brother of Gustaf Löwenhielm, who was also a general and diplomat[2].

5. Carl's illegitimate royal parentage was known, as he is consistently described in historical sources as the illegitimate son of King Charles XIII[2][4][5].

It's worth noting that while Carl Löwenhielm's biological father was King Charles XIII, he was legally recognized as the son of Fredrik Adolf Löwenhielm, who was married to his mother Augusta von Fersen at the time of his birth. This was a common practice for illegitimate children of royalty during that era.
