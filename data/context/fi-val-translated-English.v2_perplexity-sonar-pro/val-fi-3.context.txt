Dave Franco's film breakthrough came with his supporting role in the buddy comedy "21 Jump Street" (2012)[1][2][3]. This movie, based on the 1987 television series of the same name, starred Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill as young police officers going undercover in a high school. Franco played Eric Molson, a high school student who was also the lead drug dealer[3].

Prior to this breakout role, Franco had begun his acting career with small parts in films like "Superbad" (2007) and "Charlie St. Cloud" (2010)[1][2]. He also had a starring role in the ninth and final season of the comedy series "Scrubs," where he played Cole Aaronson, a wealthy medical student[1][3].

The success of "21 Jump Street" helped elevate Franco's profile in Hollywood and led to more prominent roles in subsequent films. After this breakthrough, he went on to star in several notable movies, including:

1. "Now You See Me" (2013) and its sequel "Now You See Me 2" (2016)
2. "Neighbors" (2014)
3. "Nerve" (2016)
4. "The Disaster Artist" (2017)

These roles further established Franco as a versatile actor in both comedy and drama, helping him step out of the shadow of his older brother, James Franco, and create his own distinct career path in the entertainment industry[2][3].
