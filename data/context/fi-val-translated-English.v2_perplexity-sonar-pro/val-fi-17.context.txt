Bruce Sterling edited the science fiction newsletter Cheap Truth under the pseudonym Vincent Omniaveritas[1][5][7].

Cheap Truth was a series of free, one-page, double-sided newsletters published between 1983 and 1986, with its headquarters in Austin, Texas[1]. The name "Vincent Omniaveritas" is a play on the Latin phrase "vincit omnia veritas," meaning "truth conquers all"[1].

Some key points about Cheap Truth and Sterling's role:

1. The newsletter was not copyrighted and encouraged "xerox pirates" to circulate it freely[1].

2. It served as an unofficial organ for a loose group of authors who called themselves "The Movement," later known as the Cyberpunk movement[1].

3. Cheap Truth was critical of what its editors saw as the "stagnant state of popular science fiction" at the time[1].

4. Other contributors used pseudonyms as well, such as Lewis Shiner writing under the name "Sue Denim"[1][4].

5. The newsletter ran for 18 issues, with the last one dated November 1986[4][10].

6. Sterling used Cheap Truth as a platform to define and promote the principles of the Cyberpunk subgenre[6].

7. The complete run of Cheap Truth has been compiled and is available as an ebook titled "The Complete Cheap Truth"[6][10].

Sterling's work on Cheap Truth played a significant role in shaping the discourse around science fiction in the 1980s, particularly in promoting and defining the Cyberpunk movement.
