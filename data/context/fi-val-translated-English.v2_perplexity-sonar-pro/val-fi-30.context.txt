Some key points about Katsina's population:

- The state has an estimated population of over 7.8 million as of 2016[6].
- Katsina is described as a "mono ethnic and monolingual state" with the people generally being Hausa/Fulani[7].
- About 95% of the state's population is engaged in subsistence agriculture, primarily farming and animal rearing[7].
- There are small minority populations of other groups like Maguzawa (animistic Hausas), as well as some Yoruba and Igbo who have migrated from southern Nigeria[4].
- Christianity is practiced by a small minority in the state[4].

While the Hausa and Fulani make up the vast majority, Katsina's population is predominantly Muslim and heavily engaged in agricultural activities. The state's demographic makeup reflects its position in Nigeria's predominantly Hausa-Fulani northwest region.
