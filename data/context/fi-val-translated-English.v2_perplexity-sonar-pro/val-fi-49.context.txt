The Nokia E5 was primarily designed for business users and young professionals, with a focus on messaging and productivity features. Here are the key points that support this:

1. Business-oriented design: The E5 is part of Nokia's Eseries, which is targeted at business-to-business users[1]. It features a QWERTY keyboard in a candybar form factor, making it suitable for frequent messaging and email use[1][2].

2. Business software: The phone comes with business software applications, including QuickOffice for editing Office documents[1]. It also supports corporate email solutions like Mail for Exchange and IBM Lotus Notes Traveler[1].

3. Connectivity options: The E5 offers a range of connectivity features important for business users, including Wi-Fi, 3G, GPS, and Bluetooth[2]. These allow for easy internet access, navigation, and file sharing.

4. Affordable smartphone: While targeted at business users, the E5 is positioned as a budget smartphone[1][3]. This makes it accessible to young professionals or small business owners who need business features without a high price tag.

5. Social networking and messaging: The E5 includes support for various instant messaging services and social networking sites, appealing to younger business users who rely on these platforms[1][3].

6. Long battery life: With a talk time of 8 hours and standby time of over 10 days[1], the E5 is designed for users who need their phone to last throughout a busy workday.

7. Practical design: The phone's solid build quality, comfortable grip, and relatively slim profile make it suitable for professional environments[2][9].

While the E5 maintains many business-oriented features, it also caters to a younger audience compared to other E-series devices. It balances business applications with social networking features, making it suitable for young people entering the corporate world or those who need both personal and professional functionality in a single device[3].
