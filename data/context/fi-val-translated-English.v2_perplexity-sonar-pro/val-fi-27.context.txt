World Cerebral Palsy (CP) Day is celebrated annually on October 6th[1][2][3]. This global observance day brings together people living with cerebral palsy, their families, supporters, and organizations from over 100 countries to raise awareness and promote inclusion for those affected by this condition[1][2].

The upcoming World CP Day will be observed on Sunday, October 6, 2024[3]. This will mark the 13th annual celebration of World Cerebral Palsy Day, which was first launched in 2012 by Cerebral Palsy Alliance (Australia) and United Cerebral Palsy (USA)[2].

World CP Day serves several important purposes:

1. Awareness: It aims to educate the public about cerebral palsy, which affects approximately 18 million people worldwide[3].

2. Celebration: The day celebrates the lives and achievements of people living with cerebral palsy[2].

3. Advocacy: It provides a platform to address key issues affecting people with CP globally, regardless of geographical, cultural, or economic differences[2].

4. Action: The observance encourages individuals and organizations to take action to improve the lives of those with cerebral palsy through various initiatives and events[4].

Each year, World CP Day often has a specific theme. For example, the theme for 2024 is "#UniquelyCP," which empowers people with CP, their family members, and supporters to share stories about their unique experiences[9].

By participating in World CP Day on October 6th, individuals and communities can contribute to creating a more inclusive and understanding society for people living with cerebral palsy.
