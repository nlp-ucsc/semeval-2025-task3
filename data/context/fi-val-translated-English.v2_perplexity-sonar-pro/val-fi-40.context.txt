The motto of the World Chess Federation (FIDE) is "Gens una sumus," which is Latin for "We are one family" or "We are one people"[1][2][6]. This motto was officially adopted by FIDE in 1952 and has since become an integral part of the organization's identity[7].

The phrase "Gens una sumus" reflects FIDE's vision of chess as a sport that unites people from all over the world, transcending national, political, racial, social, and religious boundaries[2]. It emphasizes the idea that chess players and enthusiasts form a global community, bound together by their shared passion for the game.

This motto aligns with FIDE's mission to promote chess as a cultural and sporting activity that fosters international cooperation and understanding. The concept of being "one family" is evident in FIDE's efforts to:

1. Organize international competitions like the Chess Olympiad, where national teams from around the world compete[2].
2. Establish universal rules and standards for chess play and competition[8].
3. Implement a global rating system that allows players from different countries to be ranked on the same scale[8].
4. Award international titles such as Grandmaster and International Master, which are recognized worldwide[8].

The motto "Gens una sumus" is prominently featured in FIDE's official documents, events, and communications. It appears on the FIDE flag, which consists of the FIDE seal (a white knight on a black globe) at the center of a sky-blue background, with the motto displayed in black below the globe[5].

By embracing this motto, FIDE emphasizes the unifying power of chess and its ability to bring people together across cultural and geographical boundaries, reinforcing the idea that the global chess community is indeed one family.
