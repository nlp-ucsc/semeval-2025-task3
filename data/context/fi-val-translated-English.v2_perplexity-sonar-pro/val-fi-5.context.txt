Chance the Rapper's real name is Chancelor Johnathan Bennett[1][5][9]. He was born on April 16, 1993, in Chicago, Illinois[1][2][5]. Bennett adopted the stage name "Chance the Rapper" early in his career, but he was originally known by other names:

1. As a child and teenager, he went by his given name, Chancelor Bennett[4].

2. When he first started performing in high school, he used the stage name "Chano"[2][4].

3. He later shortened his first name to "Chance" and added "the Rapper," creating his current professional moniker[2].

The choice of his stage name has significance to Bennett. In a 2017 interview, he explained that he wanted to embrace the term "rapper" despite some negative connotations, seeing it as synonymous with being Black. He aimed to challenge people's preconceptions about rappers and their artistry[7].

Despite his stage name, Bennett is known for his versatility as an artist. He is not only a rapper but also a singer, songwriter, record producer, and actor[1][5]. His father once suggested he change his name to "Chance the Artist" to reflect this multifaceted approach to his craft[7].
