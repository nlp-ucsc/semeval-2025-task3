The Arts and Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI) primarily focuses on arts and humanities disciplines, but it is not exclusively limited to those fields. Here are the key points about A&HCI's coverage:

1. Core focus: The A&HCI primarily indexes over 1,700 arts and humanities academic journals[1][5].

2. Disciplinary scope: It covers a wide range of arts and humanities disciplines, including language (including linguistics), poetry, music, classical works, history, oriental studies, philosophy, archaeology, architecture, religion, television, theater, and radio[1].

3. Interdisciplinary coverage: While focusing on arts and humanities, A&HCI also includes coverage of some social and natural science journals[1]. This allows for interdisciplinary connections and research across different fields.

4. Additional sources: Beyond academic journals, A&HCI covers individually selected, relevant items from approximately 1,200 titles, mostly arts and humanities journals but with an unspecified number of titles from other disciplines[1].

5. Format diversity: The index covers various types of content, including original research articles, reviews, editorials, chronologies, abstracts, scripts, letters, meeting abstracts, errata, poems, short stories, plays, music scores, excerpts from books, chronologies, bibliographies, filmographies, book reviews, and reviews of films, music, and theatrical performances[1].

6. Selective inclusion: The database is curated by editorial experts to ensure the inclusion of trusted, reliable sources[3].

7. Temporal coverage: A&HCI covers publications from 1975 to the present[1][5].

In summary, while the Arts and Humanities Citation Index is primarily focused on arts and humanities disciplines, it does include some coverage of social and natural sciences, particularly where they intersect with arts and humanities research. This approach allows for a more comprehensive and interdisciplinary perspective on arts and humanities scholarship.
