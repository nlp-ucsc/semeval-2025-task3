Captain Morgan rum has been produced since 1944. The brand was founded by Seagram Company, which began producing rum under the Captain Morgan Rum Company name that year[1][2]. 

Specifically:

- In 1944, Seagram's CEO Samuel Bronfman purchased the Long Pond distillery from the Jamaican government and started producing rum under the Captain Morgan Rum Company name[1].

- The brand was created to pay tribute to the 17th century Welsh privateer Sir Henry Morgan, who later became Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica[4].

- Initially, the rum was produced in Jamaica using a centuries-old Jamaican recipe[4].

- In the 1950s, production shifted to Puerto Rico[1][4].

- Captain Morgan was introduced to the United States market in 1984[1][2].

- In 2001, the brand was acquired by Diageo when they purchased several Seagram's assets[4].

So while the brand has changed ownership and production locations over the decades, Captain Morgan rum has been continuously produced since its founding in 1944, making it over 80 years old as of 2025.
