Galicia, an autonomous community located in northwestern Spain, consists of four provinces:

1. A Coruña (also spelled La Coruña)
2. Lugo
3. Ourense (also spelled Orense)
4. Pontevedra[1][2][3][4]

These four provinces make up the modern administrative division of Galicia. Each province has its own capital city, which shares the same name as the province itself[1]. 

It's worth noting that historically, Galicia was divided into seven provinces. In the 16th century, these seven provinces were Santiago, Betanzos, A Coruña, Lugo, Mondoñedo, Ourense, and Tui[1]. However, in 1833, a territorial reform reorganized Galicia into the four provinces we know today[1].

The capital of the autonomous community of Galicia is Santiago de Compostela, located in the province of A Coruña. While it serves as the political capital, it is not a provincial capital[1][2].

Galicia has a rich cultural heritage and a unique identity within Spain. It has its own language, Galician (Galego), which is co-official with Spanish in the region[2][6]. The region is known for its green landscapes, extensive coastline, and distinct cultural traditions[4].
