Raivotarjonta refers to the most common fetal presentation during childbirth, where the baby is positioned with its face towards the mother's back[1][10]. This is also known as the occiput anterior position in English.

Specifically:

1. Position: The baby's head is down, with the back of its head (occiput) facing the mother's front[10].

2. Prevalence: It is the most common and generally preferred fetal position for vaginal delivery[10].

3. Terminology: In Finnish, "raivo" refers to the back of the head, and "tarjonta" means presentation or offering[1][10].

4. Optimal position: This position is considered ideal for childbirth as it allows for easier passage through the birth canal[10].

5. Contrast: It is different from other presentations like avosuinen tarjonta (face-up position) or per√§tila (breech position)[10].

Understanding fetal positioning is crucial in obstetrics as it can significantly impact the course of labor and delivery. The raivotarjonta position is generally associated with smoother deliveries compared to other presentations, which may require medical interventions or alternative delivery methods.
