Johnny Cash enlisted in the U.S. Air Force when the Korean War broke out in 1950[1][3][5]. After graduating high school that year, Cash volunteered to join the Air Force rather than waiting to be drafted into the Army[9].

Cash completed basic training at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas[3]. He then received specialized training in radio communications, attending technical training at Brooks Air Force Base in Texas and radio intercept class at Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi[3].

After his training, Cash was assigned to the 12th Radio Squadron Mobile (USAFSS) at Landsberg am Lech, West Germany[3]. There he served for three years as a Morse Code Intercept Operator, monitoring and decoding Soviet Army transmissions[1]. Cash claimed that in this role, he was the first American to intercept reports of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's death in 1953[1].

During his time in Germany, Cash purchased his first guitar and began teaching himself to play[3]. He formed a band with fellow airmen called "The Landsberg Barbarians" and started writing songs, including "Folsom Prison Blues"[1].

Cash served in the Air Force until 1954, receiving an honorable discharge at the rank of Staff Sergeant[3]. His military service lasted about four years total[5]. After leaving the Air Force, Cash returned to the United States and launched his music career, signing with Sun Records in 1955[1].
