Based on the search results provided, there is no specific information about the conservation status of the fluted jellyfish. However, I can provide some general information about jellyfish conservation status:

Jellyfish as a whole are not currently listed as endangered or threatened species[4]. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, which is the global authority on the conservation status of species, does not have a specific listing for the fluted jellyfish.

Many jellyfish species are actually listed as "vulnerable" on the IUCN Red List, with decreasing population trends[10]. However, this is a broad categorization and doesn't necessarily apply to all jellyfish species, including the fluted jellyfish.

It's important to note that while jellyfish themselves may not be endangered, they can serve as indicators of marine ecosystems that are out of balance[8]. Increasing jellyfish populations in some areas may actually be a sign of environmental stress, as jellyfish can often thrive in conditions that are detrimental to other marine species.

Conservation efforts for jellyfish are not as prominent as for other marine species. For instance, box jellyfish are not considered at risk by the IUCN, CITES, or the US Federal List, and there are no specific conservation efforts for them[2].

Without specific data on the fluted jellyfish, it's not possible to definitively state its conservation status. If you need accurate information about this particular species, it would be best to consult specialized marine biology resources or contact marine conservation organizations for the most up-to-date information.
