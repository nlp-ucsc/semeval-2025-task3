The answer provided is incorrect. Let me provide the correct information:

Two Roman emperors were born in Lugdunum (modern-day Lyon, France):

1. Claudius: He was born on August 1, 10 BC in Lugdunum[1][7]. Claudius, whose full name was Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, ruled as Roman emperor from 41 to 54 AD[1][7].

2. Caracalla: He was born on April 4, 188 CE in Lugdunum[10]. Caracalla, whose original name was Septimius Bassianus, ruled as Roman emperor from 198 to 217 AD[10].

The statement that Augustus was born in Lugdunum in 43 BC is incorrect on multiple counts:

1. Augustus was not born in Lugdunum. He was born in Rome on September 23, 63 BC[2][5].

2. Augustus was born before Lugdunum was even founded as a Roman colony. Lugdunum was established in 43 BC by Lucius Munatius Plancus[8][9], which was the same year Augustus (then known as Octavian) was 20 years old.

3. The founding date of Lugdunum (43 BC) is being confused with Augustus's birth year in the incorrect statement.

It's worth noting that while Augustus wasn't born in Lugdunum, he did visit the city multiple times between 16 and 8 BC[8], which might have contributed to its importance as a Roman city in Gaul.
