The correct head town of the 12 de Octubre Department in Argentina is General Pinedo, not "12 Octobre" as stated in the given answer[1][9].

To elaborate:

1. The 12 de Octubre Department (also written as Doce de Octubre Department) is a western department of Chaco Province in Argentina[1][9].

2. According to reliable sources, the capital city or head town of this department is General Pinedo[1][9].

3. The department has an area of 2,576 kmÂ² and a population of about 20,000 inhabitants[1][9].

4. General Pinedo is located approximately 1,060 km from the federal capital of Argentina[1].

5. The demonym for residents of this area is "Pinedense"[1].

It's important to note that "12 Octobre" is not only incorrect but also appears to be a misspelling. The correct Spanish spelling would be "Octubre" if referring to the month of October, but this is not relevant to the head town of the department.

This fact-check demonstrates the importance of verifying information using reliable sources, especially when dealing with specific geographic and administrative details of regions in other countries.
