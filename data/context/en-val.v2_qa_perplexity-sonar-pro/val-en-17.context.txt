The provided answer contains some inaccuracies. Let me clarify the history of the stadium names:

Gillette Stadium, which opened in 2002, did not have a previous name. It was a newly constructed stadium that replaced the old Foxboro Stadium[5]. The previous stadium that stood on a nearby site was indeed called Foxboro Stadium, but it was a separate facility, not a renamed version of the current Gillette Stadium[1][4].

To provide a more accurate timeline of the stadium names:

1. From 1971 to 1983, the original stadium was called Schaefer Stadium, named after the Schaefer Brewing Company[1][4][8].

2. From 1983 to 1989, it was renamed Sullivan Stadium, after the family that owned the Patriots[1][4][8].

3. From 1989 to 2002, it was known as Foxboro Stadium[1][4][8].

4. Foxboro Stadium was demolished in early 2002[9].

5. The new stadium, Gillette Stadium, opened in 2002 adjacent to the old stadium site[5][7].

Gillette Stadium was initially called CMGI Field before opening, but the naming rights were acquired by Gillette before the stadium's inauguration due to the dot-com bust[5]. Therefore, it has been known as Gillette Stadium since its opening in 2002.

The renovation and expansion mentioned in the original answer likely refers to the recent $250 million North End Renovation Project completed for the 2023 NFL season, which significantly transformed Gillette Stadium's appearance and amenities[7]. However, this renovation did not involve a name change.
