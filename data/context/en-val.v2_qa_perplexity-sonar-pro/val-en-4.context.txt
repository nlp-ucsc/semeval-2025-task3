The statement "Chance the Rapper debuted in 2011" is not entirely accurate. Let's clarify the timeline of Chance the Rapper's debut:

Chance the Rapper's official debut came in 2012, not 2011. Here are the key details:

1. In 2011, Chance was still in high school and began working on his first mixtape during a 10-day suspension[1][4].

2. His debut mixtape, titled "10 Day," was released on April 3, 2012[1][3][4]. This marks his official debut as a solo artist.

3. Prior to the mixtape's release, in February 2012, Chance was highlighted by Complex magazine as one of "10 New Chicago Rappers to Watch Out For"[4].

4. The "10 Day" mixtape gained significant attention, being downloaded over 500,000 times via the mixtape-sharing site DatPiff[4].

While Chance began working on his music in 2011, his actual debut as Chance the Rapper occurred in 2012 with the release of "10 Day." This mixtape launched his career and set the stage for his future success in the music industry.
