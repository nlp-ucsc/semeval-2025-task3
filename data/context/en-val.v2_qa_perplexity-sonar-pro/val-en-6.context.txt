The provided answer about the four styles of Zhejiang cuisine contains several inaccuracies. Let me provide the correct information:

Zhejiang cuisine consists of four distinct styles, but they are different from those mentioned in the given answer. The four main styles of Zhejiang cuisine are:

1. Hangzhou style: This style is characterized by its use of bamboo shoots and rich variations in ingredients and cooking methods[1]. It focuses on freshness, lightness, and the use of seasonal ingredients[3][5].

2. Shaoxing style: This style specializes in poultry and freshwater fish[1]. It offers dishes with a special rural flavor, often using Shaoxing rice wine in cooking[5][10].

3. Ningbo style: Known for its emphasis on seafood, Ningbo cuisine specializes in salty dishes and focuses on retaining the freshness of ingredients[1][2][10].

4. Wenzhou style (also known as Ou cuisine): This style is sometimes included as a separate subdivision due to its proximity to Fujian Province. It is characterized by its extensive use of seafood, poultry, and livestock[1].

The answer provided in the query is incorrect in several aspects:
- There is no "Jiangnan style" or "Xiamen style" in Zhejiang cuisine.
- The description of Hangzhou style is partially correct about using vegetables, but it's not specifically known for meat dishes.
- There is no "Zhaozhou style" in Zhejiang cuisine.

In general, Zhejiang cuisine is known for its fresh, light flavors, emphasis on the natural taste of ingredients, and the use of seafood and seasonal products[1][2][5]. The cooking techniques commonly used include quick-frying, stir-frying, deep-frying, simmering, and steaming[2][5][8].
