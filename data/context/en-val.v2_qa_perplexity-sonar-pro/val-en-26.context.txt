Yes, the Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI) is indeed still maintained and updated by Clarivate Analytics. This can be confirmed based on the following information from the search results:

1. The AHCI is part of the Web of Science Core Collection, which is a comprehensive citation database covering multiple disciplines[1][7].

2. As of recent data, the AHCI indexes approximately 1,800 journals across 28 arts and humanities disciplines[8][9]. It contains over 4.9 million records and 33.4 million cited references, with coverage dating back to 1975[9].

3. The AHCI covers a wide range of subjects including archaeology, art, architecture, Asian studies, classics, dance, folklore, history, language, linguistics, literary reviews, literature, music, philosophy, poetry, radio, television, film, religion, and theatre[5].

4. Recent updates to the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) by Clarivate have included the addition of profile pages for journals indexed in the AHCI[6]. This indicates ongoing maintenance and development of the index.

5. In 2023, Clarivate expanded the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) to include AHCI journals, further demonstrating the continued relevance and maintenance of the index[6].

6. The AHCI is accessible through the Web of Science platform, which is described as "the world's most trusted publisher-independent global citation database"[9].

This information confirms that the AHCI is not only still maintained but is also being actively updated and integrated into Clarivate's broader citation analysis tools and metrics.
