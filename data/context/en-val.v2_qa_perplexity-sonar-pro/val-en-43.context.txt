The given answer is partially correct but lacks some important details about case-control studies. Let me provide a more accurate and comprehensive explanation:

In a case-control study, two groups are compared:

1. Cases: People who have the disease or condition being studied[2][4][5].
2. Controls: People who do not have the disease or condition being studied[2][4][5].

The primary purpose of a case-control study is to compare these two groups to identify potential risk factors or exposures associated with the disease or condition[4]. While the answer mentions comparing DNA, this is just one possible aspect that might be examined in a case-control study. In fact, case-control studies can investigate a wide range of potential risk factors, including:

- Environmental exposures
- Lifestyle factors
- Medical histories
- Genetic factors (including DNA)
- Occupational exposures
- And many other variables[1][4]

It's important to note that case-control studies are retrospective, meaning they look back in time to examine exposures that occurred before the onset of the disease[3][6]. This is in contrast to the answer's implication that the study simply compares current DNA samples.

Additionally, the control group should be carefully selected to be similar to the case group in most respects (e.g., age, gender, overall health status) except for the presence of the disease[4]. This helps ensure that any differences found between the groups are more likely to be related to the disease or condition being studied.

In summary, while the given answer correctly identifies that two groups (cases and controls) are compared in a case-control study, it oversimplifies the design and focuses too narrowly on DNA comparison, which is just one of many possible factors that can be examined in this type of study.
