The claim that Edu Manga's real name is "Eduardo Mango" is incorrect. Based on the provided search results, there are two individuals named Edu Manga, but neither has the real name Eduardo Mango:

1. Brazilian rock guitarist: Eduardo Paes de Almeida, born on October 15, 1960, in São Paulo, Brazil[1].

2. Brazilian football player: Eduardo Antônio dos Santos, born on February 2, 1967, in Osasco, Brazil[7][10].

It's important to note that these are two different people who share the nickname "Edu Manga" but have distinct full names and professions. The guitarist Eduardo Paes de Almeida passed away on November 28, 2021[1], while the football player Eduardo Antônio dos Santos had a career in professional soccer, playing for the Brazilian national team and various clubs[7][10].

The name "Eduardo Mango" does not appear in any of the provided search results and appears to be a misinterpretation or confusion of the name "Manga," which is part of both individuals' nicknames.
