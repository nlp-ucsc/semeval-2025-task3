The answer provided contains some inaccuracies that need to be corrected:

In the television series "White Collar," FBI Special Agent Peter Burke, played by Tim DeKay, is indeed the head of the FBI's White Collar Crimes Unit at the FBI's New York City field office[1][2]. The answer incorrectly states that there isn't a specific character named as the head of this unit.

Key points to correct and clarify:

1. Peter Burke's role: He is not just overseeing Neal Caffrey's work, but is the Special Agent in Charge of the White Collar Crimes Unit[1].

2. Neal Caffrey's position: While correctly described as a former white-collar criminal and art forger working as an FBI consultant, it should be noted that he works specifically under Peter Burke's supervision[1].

3. Hierarchy: The answer fails to clearly state Peter Burke's leadership position within the FBI's White Collar Crimes Unit.

4. Time frame: The show's air dates (2009-2014) are correctly mentioned[1].

In summary, Peter Burke, portrayed by Tim DeKay, is the head of the FBI's White Collar Crimes Unit in the series "White Collar," contrary to what the original answer suggests. This information is central to the show's premise and the dynamic between Burke and Caffrey.
