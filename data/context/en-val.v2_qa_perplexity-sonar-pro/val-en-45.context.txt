1. Jef Raskin died on February 26, 2005[1][2][4][5][8].

2. He was 61 years old at the time of his death[1][2][5][8].

3. He passed away at his home in Pacifica, California[1][2][5].

4. The cause of death was pancreatic cancer, which he had been diagnosed with in December 2004[1][2][5].

5. Raskin was born on March 9, 1943[1][8], which confirms his age of 61 at the time of death.

These facts are consistently reported across multiple reliable sources, including obituaries, news articles, and biographical information. The provided answer is therefore incorrect in both the date of death and the age at death.
