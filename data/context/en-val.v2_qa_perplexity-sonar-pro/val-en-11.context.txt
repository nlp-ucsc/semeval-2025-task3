The provided answer contains some inaccuracies that need to be corrected:

The merger between Takara and Tomy took place on March 1, 2006, not in 2005[1][3][7]. The companies agreed to merge in 2005, but the actual merger was completed in 2006. Specifically:

1. On May 13, 2005, Takara and Tomy announced their agreement to merge[5].

2. The merger was officially completed on March 1, 2006, creating the new company known as "Takara Tomy" in Japan and "Tomy" internationally[1][3][7].

3. The company resulting from this merger is called Takara Tomy (タカラトミー), not "Takera and Toyo Tomo" as stated in the original answer[3][7].

This merger combined two of Japan's largest toy manufacturers, with Takara being the second-largest and Tomy the third-largest at the time[1]. The merger aimed to leverage their respective strengths and position the new company to become a leading global toy manufacturer[7].
