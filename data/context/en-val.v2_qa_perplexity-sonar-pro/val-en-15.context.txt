The statement that "The white winged cough was first discovered by the English naturalist John Latham in 1770" contains several inaccuracies:

1. First description: The white-winged chough was first described by French naturalist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1817, not John Latham in 1770[1][4].

2. Scientific name: Vieillot initially named it Coracia melanorhamphos[1][4].

3. Year of description: The year 1817 is correct for the first description, not 1770[1][4].

4. Naturalist's nationality: The first describer was French (Vieillot), not English[1][4].

5. Spelling: The correct spelling is "chough," not "cough"[1][4][7].

While John Latham was indeed an English ornithologist who named many Australian birds, he is not credited with the first description of the white-winged chough[5]. Latham lived from 1740 to 1837, so he was active during the relevant time period, but he did not provide the first description of this particular species[5].

It's worth noting that other names were given to the white-winged chough after Vieillot's initial description, including Pyrrhocorax leucopterus by Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1820 and Corcorax australis by French naturalist René-Primevère Lesson in 1830, before the current name was settled by Gregory Mathews in 1912[1][4].
