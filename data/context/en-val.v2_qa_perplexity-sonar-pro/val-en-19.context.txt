The provided answer contains some inaccuracies that can be corrected based on the search results:

Captain Morgan, as a brand, was founded in 1944 by the Seagram Company in Jamaica[3][7]. The brand was not initially introduced in the United States at that time. The introduction of Captain Morgan to the United States market actually occurred in 1984, when Captain Morgan Original Spiced Rum was launched in the U.S.[3][10].

There is no mention in the search results of the specific year 1945 or 1954 in relation to the brand's introduction or the creation of the Captain Morgan image. The iconic label featuring the Captain Morgan character was designed by Don Maitz, an American artist, but the exact year of this design is not specified in the given information[3].

The origin of the rum blend is actually documented. The recipe for Captain Morgan Spiced Rum was originally created for medicinal purposes by Levy Brothers pharmacy in Kingston, Jamaica. Seagram's CEO Samuel Bronfman purchased the rights to this recipe and started producing it commercially under the Captain Morgan label[3].

In summary, Captain Morgan as a brand was invented in 1944 in Jamaica, not 1945 in the United States as the original answer suggested. The U.S. introduction came much later in 1984.
