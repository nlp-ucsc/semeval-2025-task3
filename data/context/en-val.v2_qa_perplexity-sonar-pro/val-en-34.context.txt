The provided answer contains some inaccuracies. Let's fact-check and provide the correct information:

Toruń (Thorn in German) was indeed a member of the Hanseatic League, but the dates mentioned in the given answer are incorrect. According to the search results:

1. Toruń joined the Hanseatic League in 1280[1][3][5]. This is later than the "approximately 1260" stated in the given answer.

2. Toruń left the Hanseatic League in 1411[1][3], not in 1524 as claimed in the answer. This departure occurred after the Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic War, during which Toruń had temporarily recognized Polish rule[3].

3. The statement about Toruń's membership contributing to its economic growth during the Middle Ages is generally correct. Toruń became an important medieval trade center as a result of joining the Hanseatic League[1][3].

To provide a more accurate answer:

Toruń, also known as Thorn in German, was a member of the Hanseatic League from 1280 until 1411. The city joined the mercantile Hanseatic League in 1280, which contributed significantly to its development as an important medieval trade center[1][3]. Toruń's membership in the league ended in 1411, following the Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic War and the First Peace of Thorn[3]. The Hanseatic League was indeed a commercial and defensive confederation of merchant guilds and market towns in Northwestern and Central Europe, and Toruń's participation in it played a crucial role in the city's economic growth during the Middle Ages.
