I apologize, but the provided answer contains incorrect information. The 26th Biathlon World Championships were not held in Rasnov, Romania in 2013. According to the search results, the 2013 Biathlon World Championships, which would have been the 46th edition, were held in Nové Město na Moravě, Czech Republic[8][10].

To provide the correct information:

The 2013 Biathlon World Championships took place from February 6 to February 17, 2013, in Nové Město na Moravě, Czech Republic[1][8]. This event was notable for its impressive atmosphere, with a crowd of around 20,000 spectators creating a lively and noisy environment for the competitors[8]. 

Some key points about these championships:

1. It was the 46th edition of the Biathlon World Championships[10].
2. The venue was praised by both veteran and new athletes for its impressive setup[8].
3. Norway won the mixed relay event, continuing their dominance in this discipline[8].
4. The United States achieved their best mixed-relay result, finishing 8th[8].
5. Emil Hegle Svendsen of Norway won gold in the men's 10 km sprint[8].
6. Olena Pidhrushna of Ukraine secured her first career win in the women's 7.5 km sprint[8].

It's important to note that Biathlon World Championships are typically held annually, except in Winter Olympic years, and the locations vary each year[10]. The event combines cross-country skiing with rifle shooting, as correctly described in the original answer.
