The provided answer is incorrect. Based on the search results, before the Civil War, Valrico, Florida was known as Long Pond[1][4][7]. 

Several sources confirm this information:

1. The area was called Long Pond and consisted of several cotton plantations before the Civil War[1].

2. Before the Civil War, Valrico was called Long Pond, and cotton plantations were said to have existed nearby[4].

3. The area surrounding what is now Valrico Lake was first known as "Long Pond". Thus, the Valrico area was known as Long Pond[7].

It's important to note that while the area wasn't officially named Valrico at the time, it did have a recognized name and some settlement activity. The name "Valrico" was given to the area in the 1880s by William G. Tousey, a philosophy professor from Tufts College, who purchased property in the area[1][4][7].

The claim that there is no recorded history of Valrico before the Civil War is inaccurate. While it may not have been a well-established town, the area was known and had some agricultural activity, particularly cotton plantations.
