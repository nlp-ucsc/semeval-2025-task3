The provided answer stating that "As of 2021, the estimated population in the region is around 1.5 million people" is incorrect. According to the most recent data available, the population of Galicia is significantly higher.

As of July 2024, Galicia had a total population of 2.7 million inhabitants[1]. This figure is corroborated by multiple sources:

1. The Spanish National Statistics Institute (INE) reports that as of January 1, 2024, Galicia's population was 2,705,833[3].

2. CaixaBank Research indicates that in demographic terms, the region has 2.71 million inhabitants as of 2023, which represents 5.6% of Spain's total population[5][9].

3. Wikipedia's ranked list of Spanish autonomous communities shows Galicia's population in 2024 as 2,706,643[7].

These figures consistently show that Galicia's population is well above 2.7 million, which is nearly double the 1.5 million stated in the original answer. The discrepancy is significant, and the correct population figure is crucial for understanding the demographic and economic landscape of the region.

It's worth noting that Galicia is one of the most populated autonomous communities in Spain[1]. The region faces demographic challenges, particularly an aging population, with 26.6% of its inhabitants over the age of 65, compared to the national average of 20.4%[5].

In conclusion, the correct population of Galicia is approximately 2.7 million as of 2024, not 1.5 million as previously stated. This fact is crucial for accurately representing the region's demographic situation and its importance within Spain.
