The provided answer is mostly accurate, but requires some clarification and correction:

Chris Claremont was not the sole writer of the original "Days of Future Past" storyline. While Claremont wrote the script, John Byrne co-plotted the story with him[2][8]. The credits for Uncanny X-Men #141-142 list both Chris Claremont (plot and script) and John Byrne (plot) as writers[2].

Key points to clarify:

1. Chris Claremont and John Byrne collaborated on the story's plot[2][8].
2. Claremont wrote the script based on their shared plot[2].
3. John Byrne was the penciler for the issues, not just an illustrator[2][5].
4. Terry Austin was the inker, not the artist for alternative future sequences[2][5].

The answer correctly notes that other creators were involved in later adaptations to different media. However, for the original comic book storyline, the primary creators were Claremont (writer/co-plotter), Byrne (co-plotter/penciler), and Austin (inker)[2][5][8].
