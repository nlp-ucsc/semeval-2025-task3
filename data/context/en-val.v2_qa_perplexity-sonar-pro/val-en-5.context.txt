The UN Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) defines a sustainable city as one that is inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable[1][4]. This definition encompasses several key aspects:

1. Inclusive: SDG 11 aims to make cities more inclusive, ensuring that all residents have access to basic services, housing, and opportunities[4].

2. Safe: The goal emphasizes creating safe urban environments for all inhabitants[1][4].

3. Resilient: Cities should be able to withstand and recover from various challenges, including natural disasters and climate change impacts[1][4].

4. Sustainable: The goal focuses on reducing the environmental impact of cities and promoting sustainable urban development[1][4].

Regarding the specific points mentioned in the answer to be fact-checked:

- "Equipped with infrastructure and services to ensure sustainable and equitable access to a range of basic services, such as water, sanitation, and electricity": This is largely accurate. SDG 11 does emphasize ensuring access to adequate, safe, and affordable housing and basic services for all[1][4]. Target 11.1 specifically addresses this aspect, aiming to "ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services and upgrade slums" by 2030[10].

- The second point is incomplete in the given answer. However, it's worth noting that SDG 11 covers additional aspects of sustainable cities, including:

1. Sustainable transport systems: Target 11.2 aims to provide access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems for all[10].

2. Inclusive and sustainable urbanization: Target 11.3 focuses on enhancing inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory, integrated, and sustainable human settlement planning and management[10].

3. Protection of cultural and natural heritage: Target 11.4 aims to strengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the world's cultural and natural heritage[10].

4. Reducing environmental impact: Target 11.6 addresses reducing the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including air quality and waste management[1][4].

5. Access to green spaces: Target 11.7 aims to provide universal access to safe, inclusive, and accessible green and public spaces[4][10].

In conclusion, while the first point in the answer to be fact-checked is largely accurate, it only covers one aspect of SDG 11's definition of a sustainable city. The UN's vision for sustainable cities is more comprehensive, encompassing various social, economic, and environmental factors.
