The Sakya Trizin is the traditional title for the head of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism[1]. This position is hereditary within the Kh√∂n family, which has led the Sakya lineage since its founding in 1073 CE[1][2]. The Sakya Trizin is considered the throne-holder of the Sakya order and is responsible for preserving and propagating its teachings[4].

Some key points to note:

1. The Sakya Trizin is indeed a Tibetan Buddhist monk who leads the Sakya sect[1][2].

2. The title "Sakya Trizin" literally means "Sakya Throne-Holder" in Tibetan[1].

3. The position is not specifically associated with SakyaBooks.com. This website is not mentioned in any of the provided search results.

4. The current situation is more nuanced:
   - Until 2017, the 41st Sakya Trizin was Ngawang Kunga, who held the position since 1952[4].
   - In March 2017, Ngawang Kunga passed the throne to his elder son, Ratna Vajra Rinpoche, who became the 42nd Sakya Trizin[4].
   - After retiring, Ngawang Kunga is now known as Kyabgon Gongma Trichen Rinpoche[4][10].

5. The Sakya Trizin is considered a manifestation of the Buddha's transcendent wisdom, similar to how the Dalai Lama is seen as an emanation of compassion[10].

In summary, while the given statement is partially correct about the Sakya Trizin's role, it contains some inaccuracies and omits important recent changes in the leadership structure of the Sakya school.
