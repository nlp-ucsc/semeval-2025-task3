The statement "Yes, all arachnids have antennas. However, not all of them are visible to the naked eye." is incorrect. Let me provide the correct information:

Not all arthropods have antennae, and specifically, arachnids do not have antennae at all. Here are the key points to consider:

1. Antennae are present in many arthropod groups, but not all. Insects, crustaceans, and myriapods (centipedes and millipedes) typically have antennae[1][6][7].

2. Arachnids, which include spiders, scorpions, mites, and ticks, do not have antennae[2][3]. This is a defining characteristic that distinguishes them from other arthropod groups.

3. Instead of antennae, arachnids have other sensory structures. They typically have eight legs, chelicerae (mouthparts), and pedipalps, which are used for feeding, locomotion, and sensory perception[2][5].

4. Arachnids rely on other sensory organs for environmental perception, such as specialized hairs (setae), slit sense organs, and various types of eyes[2][5].

5. The absence of antennae in arachnids is not a matter of visibility but a fundamental anatomical difference[2][3].

To summarize, while many arthropods do have antennae, arachnids (a major group within arthropods) do not possess antennae at all. This is an important distinguishing feature of arachnids within the arthropod phylum.
