The given answer "Gregory Lahm" is incorrect. 

Gregory III Laham was born as Lutfi Laham on December 15, 1933 in Daraya, Syria, near Damascus[1][9]. His birth name was Lutfi, not Gregory. The name Gregory III was chosen when he became Patriarch[9].

To provide more details:

- His full birth name was Lutfi Laham[1][5][7].
- He was born on December 15, 1933[1][3][5].
- His birthplace was Daraya, Syria, near Damascus[1][5][9].
- He chose the name Gregory III when he became Patriarch of Antioch for the Melkite Greek Catholic Church in 2000[9].

So the correct answer to "What name was Gregory III Laham given at birth?" is Lutfi Laham, not Gregory Lahm as originally stated.
