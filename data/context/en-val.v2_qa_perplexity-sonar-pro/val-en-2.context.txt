The statement "The Elysiphale order contains 5 genera" is incorrect. Based on the search results, the Erysiphales order contains significantly more than 5 genera:

1. According to the Wikipedia article (search result [2]), the Erysiphales order contains 28 genera and around 1000 species[2].

2. The same source lists several genera, including Erysiphe, Microsphaera, Uncinula, Leveillula, Phyllactinia, Sphaerotheca, Podosphaera, Cystotheca, and Blumeria, among others[2].

3. Another source (search result [4]) mentions that a study found 111 powdery mildew fungi belonging to 1 family, 5 tribes, 8 teleomorphic genera, and 2 anamorph genera in a specific region[4].

4. The comprehensive phylogenetic analysis mentioned in search result [1] focuses on the genus Erysiphe, which is described as the largest genus in the Erysiphaceae, containing more than 50% of all species in this family[1]. This implies the existence of multiple genera within the order.

In conclusion, the Erysiphales order contains significantly more than 5 genera, with the most reliable source indicating 28 genera. The original statement severely underestimates the diversity within this fungal order.
