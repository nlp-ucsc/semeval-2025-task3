The statement "Bishofshain was a constituent community in the early Middle Ages" is incorrect. Based on the provided search results, Bischofsheim was a constituent community of Mainz for a much shorter and more recent period, specifically from 1930 to 1945.

Here are the key facts:

1. Bischofsheim became incorporated into the city of Mainz on January 1, 1930[1][5].

2. It remained a constituent community of Mainz until the end of World War II in 1945[5].

3. The reason for its separation from Mainz after 1945 was due to the division of occupation zones between American and French forces. The Rhine became the boundary between these zones, which resulted in Bischofsheim being separated from Mainz[4][5].

4. After 1945, Bischofsheim once again became an independent municipality in the Gro√ü-Gerau district[5].

To summarize, Bischofsheim was a constituent community of Mainz for only about 15 years in the 20th century, not during the early Middle Ages as the statement suggests. This period was from 1930 to 1945, which is a relatively recent and brief timeframe in the context of the town's long history.
