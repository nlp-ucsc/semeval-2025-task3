The correct answer is that Ponzone borders the following municipalities:

Cartosio, Cassinelle, Cavatore, Grognardo, Malvicino, Molare, Morbello, Pareto, Sassello, Tiglieto, and Urbe[1].

This information is specifically stated in the first search result, which cites Wikipedia as its source. It's important to note that Ponzone should not be confused with Ponza, which is a different Italian municipality located on an island in the Tyrrhenian Sea, not in the Piedmont region.
