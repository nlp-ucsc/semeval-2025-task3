The given answer is incorrect. Dave Franco did not play a character named Zack in Scary Movie 5 or in Scrubs.

In Scrubs, Dave Franco played the character Cole Aaronson[1][7][10]. Cole was a medical student introduced in the ninth and final season of the show, which aired in 2009-2010[1][7]. Franco appeared in all 13 episodes of that season[1].

Some key details about Franco's role in Scrubs:

1. Character name: Cole Aaronson[1][7][10]
2. Role: Medical student[1]
3. Season: 9th (final) season[1]
4. Number of episodes: 13[1]
5. Year: 2009-2010[1][7]

It's worth noting that Franco's appearance in Scrubs was one of his early significant television roles, coming before many of his better-known film appearances[1][2]. This role helped launch his career, leading to more prominent parts in movies like 21 Jump Street, Now You See Me, and Neighbors[1][2].

The confusion with Scary Movie 5 is unfounded, as Franco does not appear in the cast list for that film. His filmography shows no connection to the Scary Movie franchise[1][2].
