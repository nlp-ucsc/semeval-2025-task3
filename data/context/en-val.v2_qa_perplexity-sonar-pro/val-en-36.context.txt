The given answer "FC Zenit-2 Saint Petersburg" is incorrect. 

FC Zhenis, a Kazakh professional football club, plays its home games at the Kazhymukan Munaitpasov Stadium in Astana, Kazakhstan[4][10]. This stadium has a capacity of 12,350 spectators[4]. 

Key facts about FC Zhenis' home stadium:

1. Name: Kazhymukan Munaitpasov Stadium (also referred to as K.Munaitpasov Stadium)[4][10]
2. Location: Astana, Kazakhstan[4][10]
3. Capacity: 12,343 or 12,350 (sources differ slightly)[4][10]
4. Home team: FC Zhenis[4][10]

It's important to note that FC Zhenis has undergone several name changes throughout its history, including Astana-1964, but its home stadium has remained the same[4].

The confusion may have arisen because the search results also mention FC Zenit and Zenit-2, but these are different teams based in Saint Petersburg, Russia, not related to FC Zhenis in Kazakhstan[2][5].
