Hamilton Academical Football Club plays their home matches at New Douglas Park, which is indeed located in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, Scotland[1][3]. However, there are some important corrections to make:

1. Stadium capacity: The stadium has a capacity of 6,018, not "around 6,000"[3][5].

2. Year of establishment: New Douglas Park opened in 2001, not 1878[3][5]. It replaced the old Douglas Park, which the club had left in 1994[5].

3. Stadium age: It is not "one of the oldest football grounds in the world still in use by a single club." In fact, it's a relatively modern stadium[5].

4. Stadium name: While commonly known as New Douglas Park, the stadium has also been called SuperSeal Stadium due to a naming rights deal in 2016[5]. More recently, it has been referred to as ZLX Stadium[1].

5. Ground-sharing: Since 2021, Hamilton Academical has been sharing New Douglas Park with Clyde F.C.[6][9].

The stadium consists of two permanent stands and one temporary stand[3][5]. It's worth noting that Hamilton Academical had no permanent home between 1994 and 2001, during which time they ground-shared at other stadiums[9].
