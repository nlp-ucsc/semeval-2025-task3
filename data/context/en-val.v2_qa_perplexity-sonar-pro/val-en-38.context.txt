The answer stating that the two factions in Bruce Sterling's "Schismatrix" are called the "Sect" and the "Heretics" is incorrect. 

The two main factions in Bruce Sterling's "Schismatrix" are actually:

1. The Shapers
2. The Mechanists

These two groups represent fundamentally different approaches to human evolution and enhancement in Sterling's futuristic universe[1][3][5]:

1. Shapers: This faction advocates for improving the human body through genetic engineering and mental control. They focus on biological and genetic modifications to enhance human capabilities[1][3][5].

2. Mechanists: This group seeks to augment human bodies and prolong life through cyborg technology and medical advancements. They embrace the integration of machinery and artificial intelligence into human biology[1][3][5].

The conflict between these two factions forms the central tension in the Shaper/Mechanist universe depicted in "Schismatrix" and related stories. The protagonist, Abelard Lindsay, navigates between these two ideologically opposed groups throughout the narrative[1][3][5].

It's worth noting that while there are other minor factions and groups in the story, the Shapers and Mechanists represent the primary division in human society in Sterling's fictional future[5][7].
