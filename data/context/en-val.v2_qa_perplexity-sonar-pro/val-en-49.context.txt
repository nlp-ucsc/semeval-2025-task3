The given answer about Carl Löwenhielm's father is incorrect. Based on the search results, I can provide the following accurate information:

Carl Gustaf Löwenhielm, born on October 6, 1771, was the son of Lord Chancellor, Count Fredric Adolph Löwenhielm (1743-1810) and Countess Augusta Fersen (1754-1846)[1]. 

It's important to note that there are multiple individuals named Carl Löwenhielm mentioned in the search results, which could lead to confusion:

1. Gustaf Carl Fredrik Löwenhielm (1771-1856), the Swedish general and diplomat[1].
2. Carl Axel Löwenhielm (1772-1861), an illegitimate son of King Charles XIII of Sweden[3].
3. Carl Gustaf Löwenhielm (1748-1801), mentioned in a family tree[7].
4. Carl Gustaf Löwenhielm (1732-1788), also mentioned in a family tree[9].

The person referred to in the original question is most likely Gustaf Carl Fredrik Löwenhielm (1771-1856), as he is the most prominent figure among these. His father was definitely Fredric Adolph Löwenhielm, not Carl Gustaf Bernhard Lönneber or any variation of that name.

The birth date (March 4, 1786) provided in the answer to be fact-checked is also incorrect. Gustaf Carl Fredrik Löwenhielm was born on October 6, 1771[1].

In conclusion, the father of Carl (Gustaf) Löwenhielm was Count Fredric Adolph Löwenhielm, not Carl Gustaf Bernhard Lönneber as suggested in the answer to be fact-checked.
