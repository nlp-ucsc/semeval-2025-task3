The statement that "The Swedish navy was founded in 1625" is incorrect. 

The Swedish Navy was actually founded much earlier, in 1522[1][3]. Specifically, it was established on June 7, 1522, when King Gustav Vasa purchased a number of ships from the Hanseatic town of LÃ¼beck[1]. This date is officially recognized as the birth of the current Swedish Navy.

Some key points to note:

1. The Swedish Navy is one of the oldest continuously serving navies in the world, celebrating its 500th anniversary in 2022[1][3].

2. The founding of the navy is closely tied to Sweden's struggle for independence from the Kalmar Union, which had united Sweden, Denmark, and Norway under Danish rule[3].

3. Gustav Vasa, who became the first modern King of Sweden, understood the importance of naval power for establishing and maintaining Swedish independence[3].

4. While there were earlier naval forces in Swedish history, such as the medieval ledungen system, the 1522 founding marks the beginning of a permanent, organized national navy[1].

5. The year 1625, mentioned in the original statement, is actually significant for a different reason in Swedish naval history. It was around this time (1625-1626) that King Gustavus Adolphus ordered the construction of the famous warship Vasa[8].

In conclusion, the correct founding date of the Swedish Navy is 1522, not 1625. The navy has a rich history spanning five centuries, playing a crucial role in Sweden's emergence as a major European power in the 16th and 17th centuries.
