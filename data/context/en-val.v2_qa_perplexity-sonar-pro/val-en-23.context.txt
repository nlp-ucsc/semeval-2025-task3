The provided answer is incorrect. The municipality of Delley-Portalban was created on January 1, 2005, not 2004 as stated in the answer to be fact-checked[1][2][4]. Multiple reliable sources confirm that Delley-Portalban was formed through the merger of the communes of Delley and Portalban on January 1, 2005[1][2][4][5]. This date is consistently mentioned across different sources, including official websites and encyclopedic entries. The part about it being formed through a merger of two neighboring communes is correct, but the year given in the original answer is off by one year.
