The provided answer is incorrect. The Bleeding Kansas civil confrontations did not take place in the 1950s and 1960s.

The correct timeframe for Bleeding Kansas was between 1854 and 1861[1][2][4]. Specifically:

1. The conflict began in 1854 with the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which allowed settlers in Kansas Territory to decide whether slavery would be allowed[1][2].

2. The most intense period of violence occurred between 1855 and 1859[1][4]. During this time, pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions engaged in violent clashes, including raids, assaults, and murders[4].

3. The conflict officially ended in 1861 when Kansas was admitted to the Union as a free state on January 29, 1861[2][4].

Key events during this period include:

- The Sack of Lawrence in May 1856[1][2]
- The Pottawatomie Massacre led by John Brown in May 1856[2][4]
- The Battle of Osawatomie in August 1856[4]
- The Marais des Cygnes massacre in 1858[4][10]

It's important to note that Bleeding Kansas was a precursor to the American Civil War, which began shortly after Kansas achieved statehood[4]. The events of Bleeding Kansas took place in the mid-19th century, not in the mid-20th century as suggested in the incorrect answer.
