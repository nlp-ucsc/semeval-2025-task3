The statement that there are typically four stages in labour (early labour stage, active labour phase, transition, and delivery) is not entirely accurate. Based on the medical literature and standard obstetric practice, labor is typically divided into three main stages:

1. First Stage: This stage begins with the onset of regular contractions and ends with full cervical dilation. It is further subdivided into two phases:
   - Latent phase (early labor): From the start of labor to about 6 cm cervical dilation[1][4].
   - Active phase: From 6 cm to full cervical dilation (10 cm)[1][4].

2. Second Stage: This stage starts with full cervical dilation and ends with the delivery of the baby[1][2].

3. Third Stage: This stage begins after the baby is delivered and ends with the delivery of the placenta[2][3].

Some sources may include a fourth stage, which refers to the immediate postpartum period, but this is not universally recognized as a distinct stage of labor.

The transition phase mentioned in the original statement is actually part of the first stage of labor, specifically the late active phase, rather than a separate stage[5].

It's important to note that while these stages are generally recognized, the exact definitions and timelines can vary slightly between different medical sources and practices. However, the three-stage model is the most widely accepted and taught in medical literature[1][3][7].
