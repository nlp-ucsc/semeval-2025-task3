The provided answer contains some inaccuracies and misconceptions. Let me provide a more accurate explanation:

Kremlins and detinets are indeed similar structures in Russian history, but they are not distinct as the previous answer suggests. In fact, "detinets" is an older term for what later came to be known as a "kremlin"[1][5].

A detinets or kremlin refers to a central fortified part of an ancient Rus' city, similar to a citadel[1]. The term "detinets" was used in many regions of Kievan Rus', including Chernihiv, Novgorod, and Kyiv, from the end of the 11th century[1]. From the 13th to 14th centuries, the term was primarily used in the Pskov-Novgorod region[1].

The Novgorod Detinets, also known as the Novgorod Kremlin, is a prime example of this structure[5]. It's a fortified complex in Veliky Novgorod, Russia, standing on the left bank of the Volkhov River[5].

The previous answer incorrectly states that the Detinets was the original fortified core of the Moscow Kremlin. This is not accurate. The Detinets and the Moscow Kremlin are separate structures in different cities. The Novgorod Detinets is in Veliky Novgorod, while the Moscow Kremlin is in Moscow[5][7].

Furthermore, the term "kremlin" is not exclusive to Moscow. There were about 400 kremlins across Russia at one point, with around 20 preserved to this day[7]. "Kremlin" (Кремль, kreml') is the general name for town and city citadels in Russia, while "detinets" is how a kremlin or citadel was called in ancient times[7].

In summary, kremlins and detinets are essentially the same type of structure, with "detinets" being the older term. They are fortified complexes that served as the central, protected area of ancient Russian cities, often housing important religious and governmental buildings[1][5][7].
