The given answer is incorrect. Here are the correct facts:

Petra van Staveren won a gold medal in the 100 meter breaststroke at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles[1][4][7]. Specifically:

1. The event was the women's 100 meter breaststroke[1][10].
2. She won the gold medal with a time of 1:09.88, which set a new Olympic record at the time[4][10].
3. The Olympics took place in 1984, not 2008[1][4].
4. The location was Los Angeles, California, not Beijing, China[1][4].
5. She won gold, not silver[1][4][7].

Petra van Staveren did not compete in the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Her Olympic success came much earlier in her career. She was born in 1966[1], making her 18 years old when she won her gold medal in 1984[7]. By 2008, she would have been 42 years old and long retired from competitive swimming.
