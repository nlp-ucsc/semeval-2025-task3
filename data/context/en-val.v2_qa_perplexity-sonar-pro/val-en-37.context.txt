Based on the search results provided, I cannot confirm that Hüffelsheim is partnered with Häfen. The information about Hüffelsheim's town partnerships is limited in the given sources. However, I can provide some relevant details:

1. Hüffelsheim does have at least one town partnership, but it is not with Häfen. According to the search results, Hüffelsheim fosters a partnership with Khrabrovo, Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia since 1985[1].

2. Khrabrovo was formerly known as Powunden when it was part of East Prussia before the Potsdam Agreement went into effect[1].

3. The search results do not mention any partnership or twinning arrangement with a town called Häfen.

4. It's worth noting that town twinning or partnerships are common practices among European municipalities, as evidenced by examples like Tunbridge Wells being twinned with Wiesbaden in Germany[5].

5. The concept of town twinning in Europe originated after World War II as a way to rebuild diplomatic relationships and reconcile citizens[8].

Given this information, the claim that Hüffelsheim is partnered with Häfen cannot be verified based on the provided search results. To accurately fact-check this claim, additional sources specifically mentioning Hüffelsheim's partnerships would be needed.
