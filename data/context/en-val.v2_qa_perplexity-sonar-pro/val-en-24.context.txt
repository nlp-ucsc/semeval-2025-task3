The provided answer is incorrect. The World Chess Federation (FIDE) is currently based in Switzerland, not Belarus. Specifically:

FIDE's headquarters is located in Lausanne, Switzerland[1][2][5]. The organization moved its headquarters from Athens to Lausanne in 2018, following a decision by the Presidential Board meeting in London[2]. 

The exact address of FIDE's headquarters is:

Avenue de Rhodanie 54
1007 Lausanne
Switzerland[2][6][9]

This move to Lausanne was motivated by the desire to be closer to the headquarters of the International Olympic Committee and other major sports associations[2]. FIDE has a long history with Lausanne, as it previously had offices there from 1995 to 2004[2].

It's worth noting that FIDE is an international organization that works with nearly 200 national federations worldwide[3][5]. While its main headquarters is in Switzerland, it operates globally and organizes events in various countries.
