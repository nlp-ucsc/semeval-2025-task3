The Macintosh project at Apple was started by Jef Raskin. Raskin was an Apple employee who envisioned a user-friendly, low-cost computer that could be used by the general public. He began the project in 1979 and named it after his favorite type of apple, the McIntosh. However, Steve Jobs later took over the project and redirected it to incorporate the graphical user interface (GUI) concepts he saw during a visit to Xerox PARC, leading to the development of the Macintosh computer as it is widely known.
