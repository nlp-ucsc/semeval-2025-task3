Sriwijaya Air Flight 182 was a scheduled domestic passenger flight that departed from Jakarta, Indonesia, on January 9, 2021. The flight was operated by a Boeing 737-500 aircraft, registration PK-CLC, and was heading to Pontianak, West Kalimantan, Indonesia.

Approximately four minutes after takeoff from Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, air traffic control lost contact with the aircraft. The plane was at an altitude of about 10,900 feet (3,322 meters) when it suddenly descended rapidly and crashed into the Java Sea, approximately 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) off the coast of Jakarta.

All 62 people on board, including 50 passengers and 12 crew members, tragically lost their lives in the accident.

Investigations into the crash were conducted by the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT). The investigation determined that the probable cause of the crash was a malfunction of the autothrottle system, which led to an uncommanded reduction in engine power. This malfunction caused the aircraft to lose altitude and crash into the sea. Additionally, the crew's failure to properly manage the situation and a possible lack of effective communication between the pilots were contributing factors.

The accident highlighted issues related to aircraft maintenance and crew training, prompting regulatory changes and increased scrutiny of aviation safety standards in Indonesia.
