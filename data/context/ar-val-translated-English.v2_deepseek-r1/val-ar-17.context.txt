I'm unable to provide the specific day of the week for January 1, 695 AD, as I don't have access to detailed historical calendars or specific algorithms to calculate ancient dates accurately. For precise information, consulting a reliable historical calendar converter or a scholarly source on ancient chronology would be recommended.
