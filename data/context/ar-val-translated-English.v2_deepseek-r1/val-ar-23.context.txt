Alright, so I need to figure out when Takara Company announced its solution. The user mentioned that Takara Company is from Japan, known for things like Transformers and Blythe dolls, but I'm not sure what specific solution they're referring to here. The user already provided some information that Takara hasn't been called that since 2006, when they merged with Tomy to become Takara Tomy. 

So, first, I should consider what "solution" the user is asking about. Since the name change happened in 2006, it's possible they might be referring to that merger as a solution. But maybe there's another significant announcement or product release that the user is interested in. Without more context, it's a bit tricky, but I can look into major events related to Takara and Takara Tomy.

I know that before the merger, Takara was known for various toy lines, including Transformers (which they co-developed with Hasbro), Blythe dolls, and games. After the merger with Tomy in 2006, they became a major player in the toy industry, combining both companies' portfolios. So the merger itself could be seen as a strategic solution to expand their market presence and improve their position in the industry.

Alternatively, if the user is referring to a different solution, like a product launch or a business strategy, I don't have enough information to pinpoint the exact date. I think the most likely scenario is that the user is referring to the merger as the solution they announced, which happened in 2005 with the official merger taking place in 2006.

I should also consider that the user might have a different solution in mind, such as a new product line, a business restructuring, or a response to a challenge. Without specific details, I can't provide an exact date. But given the information provided, the merger is a significant event that represents a strategic solution.

Therefore, my response should clarify that Takara Company is now Takara Tomy, formed in 2006, and suggest that the merger itself was a major announcement, possibly the solution referred to. If the user has a different solution in mind, I can ask for more details to provide a more accurate answer.
The company you are referring to, Takara, is now known as Takara Tomy, resulting from a merger with Tomy in 2006. If you are asking about the merger as a strategic solution, it was announced in 2005 and finalized in 2006. If you have a different solution in mind, please provide more details so I can offer a more precise answer.
