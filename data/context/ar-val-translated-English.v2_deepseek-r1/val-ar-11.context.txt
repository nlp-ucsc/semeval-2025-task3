The Kremlin, located in Moscow, has a long and storied history that predates the modern Russian state. While the term "ancient Russia" typically refers to the period before the Kievan Rus' and the subsequent medieval states, the Kremlin as we know it today began to take shape during the medieval period.

### Origins and Early Use:
- **Foundations**: The Kremlin's origins can be traced back to the fortified settlement on Borovitsky Hill overlooking the Moskva River, likely dating to the 11th century. The initial wooden fortress was built by Yuri Dolgorukiy in 1147, making Moscow a significant settlement in the region.
- **Fortification**: Over the centuries, the Kremlin underwent several transformations. In the 14th century, Dmitry Donskoy replaced the wooden walls with white stone, reinforcing its defensive capabilities.
- **Political Center**: By the late 14th and early 15th centuries, the Kremlin became the political and religious center of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. It housed the royal court, key government institutions, and important religious sites like the Assumption Cathedral.

### Functions in Ancient Russia:
- **Defense**: The primary function of the Kremlin in ancient Russia was as a defensive structure. Its strategic location and formidable walls protected the city from invaders, such as the Mongols and other rival principalities.
- **Administrative Center**: As the capital of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, the Kremlin served as the administrative heart. It was the seat of power where the prince and later the tsar would reside and govern.
- **Religious Significance**: The Kremlin was also a major religious center, hosting numerous cathedrals and churches, which were central to the spiritual life of the Muscovite state. The Assumption Cathedral, where coronations and important ceremonies took place, was a focal point.

### Key Events:
- **Mongol Invasion**: In 1237-1238, Moscow was sacked by the Mongols, and the Kremlin suffered significant damage. However, it was rebuilt and reinforced afterward.
- **Ivan III and Consolidation**: Ivan III (the Great) oversaw a major reconstruction of the Kremlin in the late 15th century, including the building of the current brick walls and towers by Italian architects, marking the establishment of Moscow as a dominant power.

### Conclusion:
In ancient Russia, the Kremlin was primarily a fortified stronghold that gradually evolved into the political, administrative, and religious center of the state. Its strategic importance and historical significance laid the foundation for Moscow's rise as the capital of Russia.
