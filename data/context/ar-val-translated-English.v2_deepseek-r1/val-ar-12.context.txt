I'm not sure which novel Bruce Sterling won the Hugo Award for. Bruce Sterling is indeed a notable author in the science fiction community, known for his work in the cyberpunk genre. One of his famous novels is *Heavy Weather*. However, I'm not certain if that's the one he won the Hugo for. It might be helpful to check the Hugo Awards database or a reliable source for the most accurate information.
