The goddess who protected and helped Odysseus was **Athena**. She was the Greek goddess of wisdom, war, and strategy, and she played a crucial role in his journey home, known as **The Odyssey**. Athena often assisted Odysseus by providing him with guidance, wisdom, and sometimes direct intervention to overcome the challenges he faced during his travels.

For example, she helped him when he was stranded on the island of the Phaeacians, ensuring that he received the assistance he needed to return to Ithaca. Athena also helped him regain his throne by supporting him in his battle against the suitors who had taken over his palace.

Her unwavering support was instrumental in Odysseus's successful homecoming and the restoration of order in his kingdom.
