Busan, the second-largest city in South Korea, has a rich history that dates back thousands of years. The area where Busan is located today was originally settled during the Silla Dynasty (57 BCEâ€“935 CE). The name "Busan" is derived from the term "Busanpo," which refers to the natural harbor in the area. Over the centuries, Busan evolved as a significant port city, playing a crucial role in trade and maritime activities. While its origins can be traced back to ancient times, Busan as a modern city was formally established in 1949. This was shortly after the establishment of the Republic of Korea (South Korea) in 1948, following the end of Japanese colonial rule in 1945. Since then, Busan has grown into a major economic and cultural hub in South Korea.
