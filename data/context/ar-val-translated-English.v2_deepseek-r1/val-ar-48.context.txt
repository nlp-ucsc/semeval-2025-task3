The dominant family during the Heian period in Japan was the **Fujiwara** clan. The Fujiwara regents effectively controlled the imperial court through strategic marriages, political maneuvering, and their influential positions as regents (Sessh≈ç and Kampaku). They reached the height of their power during the 9th to 11th centuries, with figures like Fujiwara no Michinaga being particularly influential. Their dominance led to what is often referred to as the "Fujiwara Regency."
