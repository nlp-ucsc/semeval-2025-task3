Anglo-Irish refers to people, culture, and language associated with the intersection of English and Irish heritage. Specifically:

1. People: Anglo-Irish denotes an ethnic, social, and religious group primarily consisting of descendants of English Protestant settlers in Ireland[1]. They are often associated with the Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland and typically belonged to the Church of Ireland or other Protestant denominations[1].

2. Social class: The term is frequently applied to members of the Church of Ireland who formed the professional and landed class in Ireland from the 17th century until Irish independence in the early 20th century[1]. This Anglo-Irish landed class replaced the Gaelic Irish and Old English aristocracies as the ruling class in Ireland during the 17th century[1].

3. Language: Anglo-Irish can also refer to Hiberno-English, which is the variety of English spoken in Ireland[4][5]. This includes distinctive features influenced by the Irish language and historical developments.

4. Cultural identity: Anglo-Irish individuals often had complex identities, with some feeling "English in Ireland, Irish in England" and not fully accepted in either country[1].

5. Historical context: The Anglo-Irish were prominent in various aspects of Irish society, including business, politics, and culture. They owned many major indigenous businesses in Ireland at the beginning of the 20th century[1].

It's important to note that the term "Anglo-Irish" can have different connotations depending on the context and time period being discussed. While some Anglo-Irish individuals were strong supporters of the union with Great Britain, others became influential figures in Irish nationalism and the push for independence[1].
