I apologize, but I do not have any specific information about products from a company called "Yuekuai" in the provided search results. The search results do not contain any direct mentions of a company by that exact name or its product offerings.

The search results include information about several companies with similar-sounding names, but none that match "Yuekuai" precisely:

1. Yuesai - A luxury cosmetics brand focusing on traditional Chinese beauty products.
2. Yuexiu - A large Chinese conglomerate involved in real estate, finance, and other sectors.
3. Yue Yuen Industrial - A footwear manufacturer.
4. Yuehua Hardware Products - A key blank manufacturer.
5. Yue Hwa - A retailer with department stores and specialty shops in Hong Kong.
6. Yue Hui Hardware - A fitness equipment manufacturer.

Without more specific information about the company you're inquiring about, I cannot provide details on its products. If you have any additional information about the company, such as its full name, location, or industry, I'd be happy to try to find more relevant information.
