Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi, commonly known as HJK Helsinki or simply HJK, is a professional football club based in Helsinki, Finland. Founded in 1907, HJK is the most successful and popular soccer club in Finland[1][2].

The club was established as Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi – Helsingfors Fotbollsklubb in 1907 by Fredrik Wathén. The founding meeting was held at a bowling alley in Kaisaniemi Park in May, and the first competitive fixture was played against Ekenäs IF, which HJK won 4-2[1].

In its early years, HJK became popular among Finnish-speaking students, while Swedish-speaking students preferred other clubs. In 1909, the club adopted blue and white as its colors to support the fennoman movement. The same year, bandy was introduced as the club's second official sport[1].

HJK won its first championship title in 1911. The club has since become the most successful in Finnish football, winning numerous titles:

- 33 Finnish championship titles
- 14 Finnish Cup victories
- 6 Finnish League Cup wins[2]

Throughout its history, HJK has spent most of its time in the top tier of Finnish football. The club has also represented Finland in European competitions multiple times. A significant milestone was reached in the 1998–99 season when HJK became the first and, to date, only Finnish club to play in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League[1].

Since 2000, HJK has played its home games at the 10,770-seat Bolt Arena (formerly known as Telia 5G -areena)[1][2]. The club continues to be a dominant force in Finnish football, having won six consecutive championship titles from 2009 to 2014[1].

HJK is known for its blue and white striped shirts, blue shorts, and blue socks, a kit that has remained largely unchanged for decades. The club's crest has also remained nearly untouched for a century, reflecting its rich history and tradition[2].
