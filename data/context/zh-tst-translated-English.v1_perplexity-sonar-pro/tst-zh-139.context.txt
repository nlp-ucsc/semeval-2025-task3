I apologize, but I do not have any information about Xiong Ai being recorded in ancient books based on the search results provided. The search results do not contain any specific mentions of a person named Xiong Ai or their presence in ancient texts. 

The search results cover various topics related to Chinese history, philosophy, and artificial intelligence, but none of them directly address your query about Xiong Ai. Without more specific information or additional relevant sources, I cannot provide an accurate answer about which ancient books, if any, mention Xiong Ai.

If you have more context about Xiong Ai or can provide additional details, I may be able to assist you better. Alternatively, you might want to consider searching for more specific information about Xiong Ai in historical or literary sources focused on Chinese ancient texts.
