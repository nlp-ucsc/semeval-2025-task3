I apologize, but I do not have enough accurate information to answer what the "four sides of Li Che Gao Di" refers to specifically. The search results do not contain any clear references to a person or structure named "Li Che Gao Di" or details about its four sides. 

Some possibilities to consider, though I cannot confirm any of these:

1. It could potentially be referring to some architectural feature of an imperial tomb or structure, as some search results mention "four sides" in relation to Chinese imperial architecture[7][8].

2. It may be related to a historical figure, as some results discuss Chinese emperors and leaders[2][4], but none specifically mention "Li Che Gao Di".

3. The phrase could be a mistranslation or misspelling of a Chinese name or term.

Without more context or specific information about what "Li Che Gao Di" refers to, I cannot provide a definitive answer about its four sides. If you have any additional details or can clarify the context of the question, I'd be happy to help further research the topic.
