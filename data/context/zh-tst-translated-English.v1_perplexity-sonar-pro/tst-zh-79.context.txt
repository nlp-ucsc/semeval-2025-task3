Lichens are complex organisms that result from a symbiotic relationship between fungi and algae or cyanobacteria. However, in terms of classification, lichens are primarily classified based on their fungal component. Here's a detailed breakdown of their classification:

Kingdom: Fungi

Lichens are classified within the Kingdom Fungi[6][7]. This classification is based on the fungal partner, which forms the main structure of the lichen.

Phylum: Primarily Ascomycota, with some in Basidiomycota

The vast majority of lichens (about 98%) belong to the phylum Ascomycota[1][7]. A small number of lichens have fungal partners from the phylum Basidiomycota[1].

Class: Multiple

Lichens are distributed across several fungal classes. The main classes include[1]:

1. Lecanoromycetes
2. Arthoniomycetes
3. Eurotiomycetes
4. Dothideomycetes
5. Lichinomycetes
6. Agaricomycetes (for some basidiolichens)

Order: Multiple

Lichens are found in numerous orders within these classes. Some of the major orders include[1]:

1. Lecanorales
2. Peltigerales
3. Teloschistales
4. Arthoniales
5. Verrucariales
6. Pertusariales
7. Ostropales

It's important to note that lichen classification is complex and has been subject to revisions as our understanding of fungal taxonomy evolves. The current classification system recognizes about 20,000 lichen species[7], but estimates suggest there could be up to 28,000 species worldwide[2].

Lichens are also often categorized based on their growth forms, which include:

1. Crustose (crust-like)
2. Foliose (leaf-like)
3. Fruticose (shrub-like or hanging)

These growth forms, however, are descriptive categories and do not correspond directly to taxonomic classifications[4][5].

In summary, while lichens are composite organisms, their classification in taxonomy is based on the fungal component, placing them firmly within the Kingdom Fungi, primarily in the phylum Ascomycota, and distributed across multiple classes and orders.
