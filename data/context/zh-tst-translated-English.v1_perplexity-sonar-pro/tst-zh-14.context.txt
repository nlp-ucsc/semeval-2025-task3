Several stations on Paris Métro Line 8 have had name changes over the years. Here are some notable examples:

1. Commerce station was formerly called Avenue Émile Zola until 1937[1].

2. Charles Michels station was originally named Beaugrenelle when it opened in 1913. It was renamed to Charles Michels in 1945[1].

3. La Motte-Picquet–Grenelle station was simply called Grenelle until 1949[1].

4. Grands Boulevards station was previously known as Rue Montmartre until September 1998[1].

5. École Vétérinaire de Maisons-Alfort station was called Maisons-Alfort – Ecole Vétérinaire until 1996[1].

6. Charenton – Écoles station (formerly a terminus of the line) was renamed from Charenton[1].

7. Balard station, the current western terminus of Line 8, has an alternative name of Suzanne Lenglen, though it's unclear if this was ever its official name[1].

8. Porte d'Auteuil station, which was part of Line 8 until 1937 when that section was transferred to Line 10, was originally called Wilhelm until May 15, 1921, when it was renamed to Eglise d'Auteuil[1].

These name changes often reflect evolving urban landscapes, commemorations of historical figures, or efforts to provide more precise geographical information to passengers. It's worth noting that renaming stations is not uncommon in the Paris Métro system, as it allows the network to adapt to changes in the city and society over time.
