The Aloadae, also known as the Aloads or Aloidae, were twin giants in Greek mythology named Otus and Ephialtes. Their story is filled with ambition, hubris, and ultimately tragedy. Here are the key aspects of their mythology:

## Origins and Appearance

The Aloadae were the sons of Iphimedia and Poseidon, though they were sometimes said to be the sons of Aloeus (hence their name)[1][3]. They were renowned for their extraordinary size and strength, growing at an astonishing rate of nine fingers in width and a fathom (about 6 feet) in height every year[1]. By the age of nine, they were said to be nine fathoms tall[1].

## Heroic Deeds

Despite their later antagonism towards the gods, the Aloadae were initially viewed in a heroic light:

- They rescued their mother Iphimedia and step-sister Pancratis from Thracian pirates who had abducted them from Mount Drius[3].
- They were credited with founding several cities, including Aloium in Thessaly and Ascra in Boeotia[1][3].
- Some traditions portrayed them as bringers of civilization, teaching culture to humanity[1].
- They were said to be the first to worship the Muses on Mount Helicon, consecrating the mountain to them[1][2].

## Conflict with the Gods

The Aloadae's most famous exploit was their attempt to overthrow the Olympian gods:

- They planned to stack three mountains (Olympus, Ossa, and Pelion) on top of each other to reach the heavens[1][3][4].
- In some versions, they managed to capture Ares, the god of war, and imprison him in a bronze jar for thirteen months[3][4].
- They desired to take Olympian goddesses as wives - Otus wanted Artemis, while Ephialtes sought Hera[1][3].

## Downfall

The Aloadae's hubris led to their demise. There are two main versions of their death:

1. Apollo killed them before they could fully execute their plan to storm Olympus[1][2].

2. Artemis tricked them by transforming into a deer and running between them. As they both tried to spear the deer, they ended up killing each other[3][4][5].

## Punishment in the Underworld

After their death, the Aloadae were punished in Tartarus:

- They were bound to pillars with snakes, facing away from each other[1][3].
- An owl (sometimes said to be a manifestation of the Styx) tormented them with its shrieks[1][3].

The story of the Aloadae serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of excessive pride and challenging the established order of the gods. Despite their initial heroic portrayal, their ambition ultimately led to their downfall, illustrating a common theme in Greek mythology about the perils of hubris[8].
