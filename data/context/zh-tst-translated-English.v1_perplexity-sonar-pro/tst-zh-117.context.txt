On December 28, 1895, a pivotal moment in cinema history unfolded in the heart of Paris[1][2]. The Lumière brothers, Auguste and Louis, held the first public commercial screening of motion pictures at the Salon Indien du Grand Café, located on the Boulevard des Capucines[1][7].

The setting was modest yet groundbreaking. In the basement of the Grand Café, a small room typically used for billiards was transformed into an impromptu theater[2]. The cinématographe, the Lumière brothers' revolutionary invention, was propped up on a stepladder, projecting moving images onto a white canvas that resembled a simple bed sheet[2].

The audience for this historic event was small, with only 33 people in attendance[4]. Each spectator paid one franc for admission, unknowingly participating in what would become a cultural phenomenon[2][4]. The program consisted of ten short films, each lasting about 50 seconds, showcasing scenes from everyday French life[1][4].

The first film shown, titled "La Sortie des Usines Lumière à Lyon" (Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory), set the tone for the evening[1][4]. As the images flickered to life, the audience was captivated by the novelty of seeing movement on screen. The reaction was a mix of wonder, perplexity, and even shock[2][3]. Some viewers were so startled by the realism of the moving images that there were reports of screams and accusations of trickery[2].

This humble gathering, lasting less than 20 minutes in total, marked the birth of modern cinema[2]. Within days, word spread about the miraculous moving pictures, and by New Year's Day, over 2,000 people were lining up to experience the marvel for themselves[2]. The Lumière brothers' invention had ignited a global fascination with motion pictures, setting the stage for the development of a new art form and industry that would captivate audiences for generations to come[6].
