Based on the search results, new Valeriana (valerian) species have been recently discovered in the following areas:

1. Epiphytic habitat: The first epiphytic species of Valeriana in the world was recently reported, though the specific location is not mentioned in the given search results[8].

2. Chilean Andes: Valeriana praecipitis, a new species of high altitude valerian, was discovered in the Andean ranges of the Ã‘uble Region of Chile. This species grows at elevations between 1530 and 1980 meters above sea level[9].

3. Southern Ecuador: Three new species of Valeriana were described from southern Ecuador. One of these, Valeriana plateadensis, was found near the highest peak of Cerro Plateado[10].

These discoveries highlight that new Valeriana species are being found in South America, particularly in high-altitude Andean habitats. The epiphytic species represents a novel ecological niche for the genus, as valerian plants were not previously known to grow on other plants. 

It's worth noting that while these are newly described species, the genus Valeriana is widespread globally, with about 200 species distributed across the Northern Hemisphere and Andean South America[2]. The discovery of new species in South America suggests that this region may harbor more undescribed diversity within the genus.
