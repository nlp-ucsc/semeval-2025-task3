I apologize, but I could not find any specific information about a game called "Extreme Panic" in the provided search results. The search results do not contain any references to a game with that exact title or details about its developers or publishers.

The search results mainly contain information about Panic Inc., a software development and video game publishing company, as well as some unrelated mentions of panic in different contexts. However, none of these directly relate to a game called "Extreme Panic".

If you're looking for information about a specific game, it may be helpful to provide more details or check if the title is correct. I'd be happy to assist further if you have any additional information or if you'd like to know about other games published by Panic Inc.
