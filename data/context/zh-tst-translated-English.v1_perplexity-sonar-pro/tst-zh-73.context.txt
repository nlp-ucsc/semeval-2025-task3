I apologize, but I do not have any specific information about exploration records of Velikhov Cave in the new century. The search results provided do not contain any relevant information about a cave by that name or its recent exploration history. Without reliable sources to draw from, I cannot make any claims about exploration activities or discoveries related to Velikhov Cave in recent years. If you have additional context about this cave or its location that could help narrow the search, I'd be happy to try looking for more targeted information. Otherwise, I would need to research this topic further using other sources before being able to provide an accurate answer about its exploration records in the 21st century.
