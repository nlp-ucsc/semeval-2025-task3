Brake fluids are complex mixtures designed to meet specific performance requirements. The main types of brake fluids and their key ingredients are:

## DOT 3 and DOT 4 Brake Fluids

These are the most common types of brake fluids used in vehicles today. They are glycol-based fluids with the following main components:

1. Glycol ethers: The primary ingredient, making up 50-80% of the fluid[3][6]. Common glycol ethers used include:
   - Polyethylene glycol
   - Polypropylene glycol
   - Triethylene glycol

2. Borate esters: Added to DOT 4 fluids to increase the boiling point[4].

3. Additives (20-40% of the mixture)[6]:
   - Corrosion inhibitors
   - Antioxidants
   - Metal deactivators
   - pH buffers to maintain alkalinity

DOT 4 fluids generally have a higher boiling point than DOT 3 due to the addition of borate esters[1].

## DOT 5.1 Brake Fluid

DOT 5.1 is also glycol-based but has an even higher boiling point than DOT 4. It uses similar ingredients to DOT 4 but with a modified formulation to achieve better performance[2].

## DOT 5 Brake Fluid

Unlike the other DOT fluids, DOT 5 is silicone-based[2][5]. Its main ingredients include:

1. Silicone oils
2. Additives for performance enhancement

DOT 5 is not compatible with other DOT fluids and is primarily used in specific applications like classic cars or military vehicles[9].

## Other Specialized Brake Fluids

1. Racing brake fluids: These are typically based on glycol ethers but with specialized additives to achieve extremely high boiling points[8].

2. Low viscosity brake fluids: These use similar base ingredients to standard DOT 4 fluids but are formulated to have lower viscosity for improved performance in ABS and ESP systems[8].

It's important to note that the exact formulations of brake fluids can vary between manufacturers, and many products contain proprietary blends of additives to achieve specific performance characteristics[3].
