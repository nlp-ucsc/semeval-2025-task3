I apologize, but I don't have specific information about the orbital parameters of asteroid 7532 in the provided search results. The search results contain general information about orbital elements and asteroid databases, but they don't include data for this particular asteroid.

To provide accurate orbital parameters for asteroid 7532, we would need to consult a reliable astronomical database or recent scientific publication with specific data for this object. Some potential sources for this information could include:

1. The Minor Planet Center's MPCORB database[5], which contains orbital elements of minor planets.

2. NASA JPL's Small-Body Database (SBDB)[8], which provides orbits for known small bodies like asteroids.

3. Recent scientific publications or astronomical observations focused on this specific asteroid.

Without access to these specific sources, I cannot provide the exact orbital parameters for asteroid 7532. If you need this information, I recommend checking one of the mentioned databases or consulting with an astronomer who has access to up-to-date asteroid orbital data.
