Nina Curtis has won one Olympic medal in her sailing career. Specifically, she won a silver medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London[1][2][3].

Curtis competed in the Elliott 6m women's match racing event at the 2012 Olympics. She was part of a three-person team alongside Olivia Price and Lucinda Whitty representing Australia[2]. The Australian team performed exceptionally well throughout the competition:

1. They went undefeated through the round-robin stage.
2. Defeated the Netherlands 3-1 in the quarter-finals.
3. Came from behind to beat Finland in the semi-finals.
4. Faced Spain in the final, where they ultimately secured the silver medal after a close 3-2 loss[2].

At the time of her Olympic success, Curtis was 24 years old[2]. This achievement was particularly impressive given the relative youth of the Australian team, with Curtis being the oldest at 24, while her teammates were 19 (Price) and 22 (Whitty) years old[2].

The silver medal at the 2012 London Olympics remains Nina Curtis's only Olympic medal to date[1][3][7]. However, it's worth noting that this accomplishment is part of a broader successful sailing career that includes other notable achievements, such as world championships and participation in prestigious sailing events like the Volvo Ocean Race and SailGP[5][8].
