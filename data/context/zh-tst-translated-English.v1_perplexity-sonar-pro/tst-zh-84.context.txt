Chuseok, also known as Hangawi, is a major harvest festival in Korea with ancient roots dating back over 2,000 years. The origins of Chuseok can be traced to Korea's agrarian past and likely evolved from shamanistic harvest moon celebrations[1][4].

According to popular legend, Chuseok originated from a custom called "gabae" during the reign of the third king of Silla (57 BC - 935 AD). This month-long weaving contest between two teams culminated in a feast where the winning team was treated by the losing team[1]. However, many scholars believe the festival has even older shamanistic roots as a ritual to worship and thank the harvest moon deities[1][4].

As an autumn harvest festival, Chuseok developed as a way for families and communities to:

1. Celebrate the bountiful harvest
2. Give thanks to ancestors for their blessings
3. Pray for continued prosperity in the coming year

The festival traditionally centered around the full harvest moon, which appears on the 15th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar[6]. This timing aligns with the autumn equinox, marking the transition from summer to fall.

Over time, Chuseok incorporated various customs and rituals, including:

- Charye: Memorial services to honor ancestors
- Seongmyo: Visits to ancestral grave sites 
- Preparation of special foods like songpyeon (rice cakes)
- Traditional games and activities

As Korea transitioned from an agricultural to an industrial society, Chuseok evolved but retained its core as a time for family gatherings, ancestral reverence, and harvest celebrations[4]. Today, it remains one of the most important holidays in Korean culture, blending ancient traditions with modern practices as families come together to honor their heritage and give thanks for their blessings[8][9].
