The highest point in Altadena, USA is Mount Lowe, with an elevation of 5,606 feet (1,709 meters) above sea level[7]. Mount Lowe is located in the San Gabriel Mountains, directly north of Altadena.

Some key details about Mount Lowe:

1. Originally named Oak Mountain, it was renamed after Professor Thaddeus S.C. Lowe, who was credited as the first person to reach its summit and plant the American flag there[7].

2. It became famous as part of the Mount Lowe Railway, a scenic railway built by Professor Lowe in 1896 that took tourists up the mountain[7].

3. The mountain was chosen as an alternative to the more prominent Mount Wilson when attempts to secure rights of way to that peak failed[7].

4. Several hiking trails lead to and around Mount Lowe, stemming from the historic Mount Lowe Tavern that operated at Crystal Springs below the summit from 1895 to 1936[7].

5. Today, Mount Lowe can be approached via Echo Mountain or Chaney Trail, using a fire road that follows the old railway right-of-way[7].

While Mount Lowe is the highest point, it's worth noting that Altadena itself has varying elevations. The community's average elevation is around 1,309 feet (399 meters)[1][2], with some areas being lower and others higher as the terrain rises towards the San Gabriel Mountains.
