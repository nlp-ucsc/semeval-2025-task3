The splendid fairywren (Malurus splendens) is widely distributed across much of Australia, primarily in arid and semi-arid regions. Its range can be described in two main areas:

1. Western and Central Distribution:
   - From Shark Bay in Western Australia, southward through the state[2][4]
   - Through South Australia, except for the coast[4]
   - Into the southern and central parts of the Northern Territory[4]
   - Extending to the Flinders Ranges in South Australia[2][4]

2. Eastern Distribution:
   - From the Flinders Ranges in South Australia[4]
   - The far north-western tip of Victoria[4]
   - Central-western New South Wales, east to about Moree and Balranald[3][4]
   - South-central Queensland[3][4]

The splendid fairywren inhabits a variety of environments within these regions, including:

- Arid and semi-arid zones[3]
- Dry scrublands[1]
- Mallee eucalyptus woodlands[1]
- Dense shrublands or woodlands of acacia[4]
- Forested areas in the southwest[3]

It's worth noting that unlike some other fairywren species, the splendid fairywren has not adapted well to urbanized areas and has disappeared from some human-modified landscapes[3]. The species prefers areas with ample vegetation for shelter, typically in drier parts of the country[3].

The distribution of the splendid fairywren also varies by subspecies, with different forms occupying specific regions within the overall range[1][3]. This distribution pattern is believed to be the result of historical climate changes and subsequent isolation of populations, leading to the evolution of distinct subspecies in different parts of Australia[3].
