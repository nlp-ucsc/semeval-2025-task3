Based on the search results, Leptobotia species are primarily distributed in the following river basins in China:

1. Yangtze River Basin:
   - Leptobotia elongata is endemic to the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River (also known as Changjiang River)[1][4][7].
   - It is found in the middle and lower reaches of the Jinsha River, upper reaches of the Yangtze River, Minjiang River, Jialing River, and Qujiang River[6].

2. Pearl River Basin:
   - Many Leptobotia species are known from the Pearl River (Zhu-Jiang) Basin in southern China[10].

3. Lancang River:
   - Leptobotia elongata is also recorded in the Lancang River[6].

4. East Tiaoxi River:
   - While not specifically mentioning Leptobotia, this river system in China hosts several loach species, including the related genus Leptobotia tchangi[3].

The distribution of Leptobotia species appears to be concentrated in the freshwater systems of southern and central China, with a particular emphasis on the Yangtze River Basin. These fish typically inhabit the upper and middle streams of rivers, as well as shoals and mountain streams[1][4]. It's worth noting that some species, like Leptobotia elongata, have been introduced to other regions within China from their native ranges[7].
