The 2013 Iranian presidential election took place on June 14, 2013 and was a significant event in Iran's political landscape. Here are the key details about the background and context of this election:

1. Timing and significance: The election was held in the shadow of the turbulent 2009 presidential election, which had resulted in widespread protests known as the Green Movement[1]. It was seen as a critical moment for Iran, both domestically and in its relations with the international community[2].

2. Candidates and vetting process: 
   - 686 candidates initially registered to run[8].
   - The Guardian Council, which vets candidates, approved only 8 candidates to run in the election[4].
   - This represented an approval rate of just 1.1% of registered candidates[8].

3. Key candidates:
   - Hassan Rouhani emerged as the moderate/reformist candidate[4].
   - Other prominent candidates included Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, Ali Akbar Velayati, and Saeed Jalili[4].

4. Political context:
   - The election took place during a period of increasing tensions between Iran and the international community over its nuclear program[2].
   - There were also significant domestic challenges, including economic sanctions and political divisions[5].

5. Supreme Leader's influence:
   - Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader, played a crucial role in shaping the election process[1].
   - There were efforts to "engineer" the election to ensure a loyal president would be elected[1].

6. Voter turnout and participation:
   - The regime emphasized the importance of high voter turnout to demonstrate legitimacy[3].
   - Ultimately, the election saw a turnout of 72.94%, with 36,821,538 out of 50,483,192 eligible voters participating[8].

7. International scrutiny:
   - The election was closely watched by the international community, given Iran's nuclear program and regional influence[2].

8. Domestic concerns:
   - There were restrictions on cultural and political activities among Iran's ethnic minorities[9].
   - The government sought to prevent a repeat of the 2009 post-election protests[6].

The 2013 election was ultimately won by Hassan Rouhani, who secured 50.60% of the vote, avoiding a run-off[8]. This outcome was seen as a victory for the moderate/reformist faction and set the stage for significant changes in Iran's domestic and foreign policy in the following years.
