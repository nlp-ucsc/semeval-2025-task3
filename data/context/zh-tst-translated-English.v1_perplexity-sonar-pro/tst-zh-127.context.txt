3. Benthophilus casachicus
4. Benthophilus ctenolepidus
5. Benthophilus durrelli (Don tadpole-goby)
6. Benthophilus granulosus (Granular pugolovka)
7. Benthophilus grimmi

17. Benthophilus ragimovi
18. Benthophilus spinosus (Spiny pugolovka)
19. Benthophilus stellatus (Stellate tadpole-goby)
20. Benthophilus svetovidovi

These species are distributed in the fresh and brackish waters of the Black Sea, Caspian Sea, and Sea of Azov basins[4]. They typically inhabit deep waters, deltas, estuaries, and coastal areas with varying salinity levels. Tadpole-gobies are generally small fish, not exceeding 15 cm in length, with a short lifespan of about one year[4].

Some notable characteristics of specific species include:

- Benthophilus stellatus: Spawns after the first winter, between May and June. Females die shortly after spawning, while males survive for a few more weeks[1].

- Benthophilus leobergius: Distinguished by having two tubercles between the eyes and a projecting upper jaw[9].

- Benthophilus leptocephalus: A deepwater species found in the central Caspian Sea, from the mouth of the Samur River to Türkmenbaşy[7].

These fish play an important role in the ecosystems of the Ponto-Caspian region and are adapted to various environmental conditions within their range.
