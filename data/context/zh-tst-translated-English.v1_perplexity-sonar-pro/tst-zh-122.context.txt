Based on the search results provided, there don't appear to be any specific new competition rules implemented for the women's over 67 kg Taekwondo competition at the 2012 Summer Olympics. The information given mostly pertains to the general format and results of the Taekwondo competitions at those Olympics.

However, I can provide some details about the competition format and rules that were in place for Taekwondo at the 2012 London Olympics:

1. The competition used a single elimination tournament format[1].

2. Two bronze medals were awarded in each weight category[1].

3. A repechage system was used to determine bronze medal winners. Athletes who lost to the finalists competed in the repechage[1].

4. Matches were held on a platform 0.6m - 1m high from the base[5].

5. Points were awarded as follows:
   - 1 point for a valid punch to the trunk protector
   - 2 points for a valid kick to the trunk protector
   - 3 points for a valid kick to the head
   - 4 points for a valid turning kick to the head[6]

6. Matches consisted of three 2-minute rounds[8].

7. An instant video replay system was available for coaches to request reviews of decisions[5].

It's worth noting that significant rule changes were implemented for Taekwondo at the Paris 2024 Olympics, including a best-of-three rounds format similar to tennis[4]. However, these changes were not in effect for the 2012 London Olympics.
