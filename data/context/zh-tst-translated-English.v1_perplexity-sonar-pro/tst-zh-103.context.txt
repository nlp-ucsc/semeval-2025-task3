The 2008 Zimbabwean general election was a complex and controversial event that unfolded in multiple stages:

First Round (March 29, 2008):

1. Presidential Election:
- Morgan Tsvangirai (MDC) received 47.9% of the vote
- Robert Mugabe (ZANU-PF) received 43.2% of the vote[1]
- As neither candidate secured over 50% of the vote, a run-off was required[1][6]

2. Parliamentary Election:
- The MDC won the majority in the House of Assembly for the first time since Zimbabwe's independence in 1980[1][4]
- MDC won 100 seats
- ZANU-PF won 99 seats
- MDC-AM (a splinter faction) won 10 seats
- 1 independent candidate was elected[4]

3. Senate Election:
- ZANU-PF remained the largest party with 30 seats
- MDC won 24 seats
- MDC-AM won 6 seats[4]

Run-off Presidential Election (June 27, 2008):

- The period between the first round and the run-off was marked by significant political violence, primarily attributed to ZANU-PF supporters[1][6]
- On June 22, Tsvangirai withdrew from the race, citing violence against his supporters[1][7]
- Despite Tsvangirai's withdrawal, the election proceeded with Mugabe as the sole active candidate[1][8]
- Mugabe was declared the winner and sworn in for another term on June 29[1][7]

Aftermath:

- The run-off election was widely condemned internationally as neither free nor fair[6][7]
- Following negotiations mediated by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), a power-sharing agreement was reached on September 15, 2008[7]
- Under this agreement, Mugabe remained President, Tsvangirai became Prime Minister, and Arthur Mutambara (leader of the MDC splinter faction) became Deputy Prime Minister[7]

The 2008 election was a pivotal moment in Zimbabwe's history, marking the first time the ruling ZANU-PF party lost its parliamentary majority since independence. However, the controversial run-off and subsequent power-sharing agreement highlighted the ongoing challenges in Zimbabwe's democratic process.
