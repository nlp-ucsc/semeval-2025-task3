Catherine McCormack is an author, art historian, and independent curator with several notable works to her name. Her most prominent publications include:

1. "Women in the Picture: What Culture Does with Female Bodies" (2021)[1][2][4]
This book is a polemic about patriarchy, feminism, and art history. It examines how women have been depicted in art throughout history and the cultural implications of these representations. Published by W.W. Norton in the US and Icon Books in the UK, this work has garnered significant attention for its feminist perspective on art history.

2. "The Art of Looking Up" (2019)[1][2][6]
This book explores the often-overlooked art of ceilings and domes in architecture and painting. It offers a unique perspective on art history by focusing on works that are literally above our heads.

3. "Hedonist's Guide to Rome" (2006)[1][2]
While less academic than her later works, this travel guide showcases McCormack's versatility as a writer.

In addition to her books, McCormack has also made contributions to other media:

- She curated an acclaimed two-part show on contemporary art and motherhood at Richard Saltoun Gallery in London in 2019[4].
- In 2022, she curated a year-long program of events, interviews, talks, and performances around the topic of Radical Joy with Unit London[4].
- She is a regular contributor to BBC Radio 4's Front Row and The New European Newspaper[4].

It's worth noting that while McCormack is listed as an author for "Villette" on Goodreads[1][2], this appears to be an error as "Villette" is actually a novel by Charlotte BrontÃ« published in 1853. McCormack's work focuses primarily on art history and cultural criticism, with a particular emphasis on feminist perspectives in art.
