I apologize, but I do not have enough accurate information to determine which municipalities border Labélière, France. The search results do not provide any specific information about Labélière or its neighboring municipalities. 

Additionally, I'm not certain that Labélière is a valid commune name in France. The commune system in France is quite complex, with over 34,000 communes as of 2021[3], but I don't have a comprehensive list to verify if Labélière is among them.

To accurately answer this question, we would need more specific information about Labélière's location within France and access to detailed local administrative maps. If you have any additional details about Labélière's location or department, that could help in researching its neighboring municipalities. Alternatively, you may want to consult official French government sources or detailed regional maps for the most up-to-date and accurate information on commune boundaries.
