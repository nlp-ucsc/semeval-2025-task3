The number of nominations for the Best Supporting Actor category at the British Academy Film Awards (BAFTAs) has varied over the years. Here's an overview of how the nominations have changed:

1960s-1970s:
In the early years of the award, there were typically 4 nominees per year[1]. For example, in 1968 and 1969, there were 4 nominees each year.

1980s:
There was some variation in this decade:
- In 1980, no award was given out in this category[1].
- In 1981, the award was temporarily replaced with a gender-neutral "Best Supporting Artist" category, which had 4 male nominees[1].
- For most other years in the 1980s, there were 4 nominees per year[1].

1990s-2000s:
The standard practice of having 4 nominees per year generally continued through these decades[1].

2010s-Present:
In recent years, the number of nominees has increased:
- As of 2025, there are 6 nominees in the Supporting Actor category[2][9]. This expanded field allows for more recognition of performances.

It's worth noting that the number of nominees can sometimes vary slightly from year to year based on voting results or specific decisions by the British Academy. However, the general trend has been a move from 4 nominees in earlier decades to 6 nominees in recent years, allowing for greater representation and recognition in this category.
