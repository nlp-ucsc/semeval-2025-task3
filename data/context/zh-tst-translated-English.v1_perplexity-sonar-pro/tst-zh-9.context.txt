The Second Council of Nicaea, held in 787 AD, had a profound and lasting impact on Christian theology, practice, and church unity. Here are some of the key effects:

## Restoration of Iconography

The council's most significant impact was the restoration and affirmation of the use of icons in Christian worship[1][3]. It declared that icons deserve reverence and veneration, though not adoration, which is reserved for God alone[3]. This decision effectively ended the first phase of the Byzantine Iconoclasm, restoring the use of religious images that had been suppressed by previous emperors[1][4].

## Theological Implications

The council's decision on icons had deep theological significance:

1. It reaffirmed the doctrine of the Incarnation, asserting that because God became visible in Christ, He could be depicted in images[4].

2. It distinguished between veneration (proskynesis) of icons and the worship (latria) reserved for God, creating a nuanced understanding of Christian devotional practices[10].

## Ecumenical Significance

The Second Council of Nicaea is recognized as the seventh and last ecumenical council by both the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church[1]. This shared acceptance contributes to the council's importance in ecumenical relations between these two major Christian traditions.

## Liturgical and Cultural Impact

The council's decisions had far-reaching effects on Christian worship and culture:

1. It decreed that every altar should contain a relic, a tradition maintained in both Catholic and Orthodox churches[3].

2. The restoration of icons profoundly influenced Byzantine and later Eastern Orthodox art and architecture[4].

## Church Organization

The council reaffirmed principles of church organization, particularly the self-governance of different regions within the Church[2]. It also elevated the status of Constantinople, declaring it should have "the prerogative of honor after the Bishop of Rome"[2].

## Long-term Historical Significance

While the council's decisions were temporarily overturned during a second period of iconoclasm (813-843 AD), they were ultimately reinstated and have shaped Christian practice for over a millennium[4]. The council's affirmation of icons has influenced not only Eastern Orthodox and Catholic traditions but also continues to be a point of discussion and sometimes disagreement in broader Christian discourse, particularly with Protestant denominations[10].

In conclusion, the Second Council of Nicaea had a profound impact on Christian theology, worship practices, and church unity. Its decisions continue to shape Christian thought and practice to this day, making it a crucial event in the history of Christianity.
