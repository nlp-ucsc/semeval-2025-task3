University College Cork has had several names throughout its history:

1. Queen's College Cork (QCC): This was the original name when the institution was founded in 1845[1][2][5]. It was established as one of three Queen's Colleges in Ireland, along with those in Belfast and Galway[2].

2. University College, Cork (UCC): In 1908, the Irish Universities Act changed the name from Queen's College Cork to University College Cork[4][5]. This change occurred when the college became part of the newly established National University of Ireland[5].

3. National University of Ireland, Cork: The Universities Act 1997 renamed the university as National University of Ireland, Cork[1].

4. University College Cork – National University of Ireland, Cork: A Ministerial Order in 1998 gave the university its current official name[1]. However, it's worth noting that despite this formal name, the institution continues to be widely known simply as University College Cork or UCC[1].

Throughout these name changes, the Irish name of the university has remained Coláiste na hOllscoile Corcaigh[1].

It's interesting to note that despite the various official name changes, the university has maintained strong connections to its history. For example, its motto "Where Finbarr Taught, Let Munster Learn" references St. Finbarr, the patron saint of Cork, and reflects the institution's deep roots in the region[1][2].
