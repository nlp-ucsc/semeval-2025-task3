John Waters is an iconic American filmmaker known for his transgressive, provocative, and often darkly comedic works. His most representative films include:

1. Pink Flamingos (1972): This cult classic is perhaps Waters' most notorious film. It follows Divine as she competes for the title of "Filthiest Person Alive" and features shocking, boundary-pushing scenes that cemented Waters' reputation as a provocateur[1][7].

2. Female Trouble (1974): Considered by many to be Waters' best work, this film stars Divine as Dawn Davenport, a troubled teenager who becomes a criminal. It offers a nuanced commentary on consumerism and criminality[4].

3. Hairspray (1988): This marked Waters' transition to more mainstream success. The comedy, set in 1960s Baltimore, deals with racial integration and became a hit Broadway musical and was later adapted into a major Hollywood film[1][3].

4. Cry-Baby (1990): A musical comedy starring Johnny Depp that parodies 1950s teen rebel movies. It showcases Waters' camp sensibilities and his ability to work with more mainstream actors[2].

5. Serial Mom (1994): Starring Kathleen Turner, this dark comedy about a seemingly perfect suburban mother who becomes a serial killer exemplifies Waters' subversive take on American culture[2].

6. Polyester (1981): Notable for its use of "Odorama" scratch-and-sniff cards, this film starring Divine and Tab Hunter represents Waters' experimentation with film techniques and his ability to satirize suburban life[1][2].

These films showcase Waters' evolution as a filmmaker, from his early transgressive works to his later, more accessible but still subversive comedies. They all share his distinctive style, combining shock value, camp aesthetics, and social commentary[1][3][7].
