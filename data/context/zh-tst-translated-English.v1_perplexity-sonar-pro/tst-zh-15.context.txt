Plants of the Abrus genus are distributed across several tropical and subtropical regions around the world[1]. Specifically:

1. Africa: Abrus species are found naturally across tropical Africa, including countries like Nigeria, Ghana, and Somalia[1][3].

2. Madagascar: Several Abrus species are endemic to Madagascar, such as Abrus aureus and Abrus madagascariensis[1].

3. Arabian Peninsula: Some species like Abrus bottae are found in Saudi Arabia and Yemen[1].

4. South Asia: Countries like India are home to Abrus species, including the well-known Abrus precatorius[1][4].

5. Southeast Asia: The genus is present in countries like Laos and Vietnam[1].

6. Southern China: Some Abrus species occur naturally in southern parts of China[1].

7. Australia: Abrus precatorius is native to parts of northern and eastern Australia[1][9].

8. New Guinea: The genus has a natural presence on this island[1].

9. Pacific Islands: Some species have spread to various Pacific islands, including Hawaii (though as an introduced species)[4].

10. Americas: While not native, some Abrus species, particularly Abrus precatorius, have been introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of the United States like Florida[1][4][5].

It's important to note that while Abrus species are naturally distributed across many of these regions, some, like Abrus precatorius, have become invasive in areas where they were introduced, spreading beyond their native ranges[4][5].
