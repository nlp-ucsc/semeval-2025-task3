The West Athens Regional Unit is one of the regional units of Attica, Greece. It consists of 7 municipalities:

1. Agia Varvara
2. Agioi Anargyroi-Kamatero
3. Aigaleo (also spelled Egaleo)
4. Chaidari
5. Ilion
6. Peristeri
7. Petroupoli

This regional unit was created as part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, which restructured the administrative divisions throughout Greece[5]. It covers the west-central part of the Athens metropolitan area, spanning approximately 66.7 square kilometers[2]. The West Athens Regional Unit is home to 478,883 inhabitants and is connected to central Athens through an extensive network of public transportation and major arterial roads[2].

The area is characterized by its urban landscape and is bounded by natural features such as Mount Egaleo and Mount Poikilo, which create distinct geographical sectors among the seven municipalities[2]. Each municipality within the Regional Unit maintains community centers where residents participate in local governance and organize traditional Greek celebrations[2].
