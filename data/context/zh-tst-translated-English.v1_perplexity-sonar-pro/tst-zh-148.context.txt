The traditional jersey colors of Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi (HJK Helsinki), the most successful football club in Finland, are blue and white[4]. Specifically:

1. Home kit: The club's home jersey features blue and white vertical stripes[4].

2. Shorts: The home kit is typically paired with blue shorts[4].

3. Socks: The traditional sock color is blue[4].

This blue and white color scheme has been a long-standing tradition for HJK Helsinki. The club adopted these colors in 1909 to show support for the fennoman movement, which promoted Finnish national identity and culture[4]. 

It's worth noting that while the striped pattern has been the norm for most of the club's history, there was a brief period in the 1970s when the club switched to a solid blue shirt due to sponsor demands. However, in 1986, responding to fan requests, the club returned to its iconic blue and white striped design[4].

The consistency in maintaining these colors has made the blue and white stripes synonymous with HJK Helsinki, contributing to the club's strong visual identity in Finnish and European football.
