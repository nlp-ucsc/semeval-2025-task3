Bahram I executed Mani, the founder of Manichaeism, in 274 CE due to several key factors:

1. Religious conflict: Bahram I was a follower of Zoroastrianism, the traditional Persian religion, while Mani had founded a new faith that challenged Zoroastrian beliefs[1][5]. This religious difference created tension between Mani and the Zoroastrian establishment.

2. Influence of Zoroastrian clergy: The powerful Zoroastrian priest Kartir strongly opposed Mani's teachings and influenced Bahram I to take action against him[5]. Kartir saw Mani as a threat to Zoroastrian orthodoxy and pushed for his persecution.

3. End of religious tolerance: While previous Sasanian rulers like Shapur I had been tolerant of religious minorities, Bahram I's reign marked a shift towards enforcing Zoroastrianism as the state religion[5]. This change in policy made Mani and his followers vulnerable to persecution.

4. Political motivations: By executing Mani, Bahram I likely aimed to consolidate his power and gain support from the Zoroastrian priesthood[2]. This act demonstrated his commitment to defending the traditional Persian religion.

5. Perceived heresy: To the Zoroastrian clergy, Mani's teachings were seen as heretical and a dangerous mix of various religious ideas, including elements from Judaism, Buddhism, and Christianity[5].

The execution was carried out in a brutal manner, with some accounts stating that Mani was flayed alive and his skin was stuffed and displayed as a warning to his followers[6][8]. This gruesome act was intended to terrorize Mani's disciples and discourage the spread of Manichaeism.

Ironically, Mani's execution had the opposite effect of what Bahram I intended. Instead of eradicating the new faith, it turned Mani into a martyr figure for his followers, strengthening their resolve and commitment to his teachings[8]. The persecution of Manichaeans that followed under Bahram I's rule actually contributed to the spread of the religion beyond Persia's borders as followers fled to other regions[1][3].
