The Alpine region primarily refers to the area surrounding the Alps mountain range in Europe. This region includes territories from eight countries, known as the Alpine states or Alpine countries:

1. Austria
2. France
3. Germany
4. Italy
5. Liechtenstein
6. Monaco
7. Slovenia
8. Switzerland[1][2]

These countries are associated with the Alpine region as defined by the Alpine Convention of 1991[2]. However, the extent of Alpine territory varies significantly among these countries:

## Alpine Coverage

- Austria and Switzerland have the largest proportion of their territories within the Alpine region, with about 65% of each country covered by the Alps[1][2].
- Italy (27.2%) and France (21.4%) have significant Alpine areas, but these represent smaller portions of their total land area[2].
- Germany, Slovenia, Liechtenstein, and Monaco have smaller Alpine territories, with Liechtenstein and Monaco being entirely within the Alpine region due to their small size[1].

## Broader Alpine Region

Some definitions of the Alpine region extend beyond these eight countries. For instance, the European Union's Alpine Space Programme includes parts of additional countries:

- Bulgaria
- Croatia
- Finland
- Poland
- Romania
- Slovakia
- Spain
- Sweden[3]

These additional countries are included due to their mountainous regions that share similar characteristics with the Alps, although they are not part of the main Alpine mountain range.

## Geographic Extent

The Alpine region covers approximately 190,000 square kilometers (73,000 square miles)[1]. It stretches about 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) across Europe, from the Mediterranean coast near Nice, France, to Vienna, Austria[4].

## Key Features

The Alpine region is characterized by:

- High mountain peaks, with 1,599 peaks in total, including 29 that are 4,000 meters or higher above sea level[1].
- Diverse ecosystems, including forests, semi-natural grasslands, alpine meadows, and areas of permanent snow and ice[4].
- Rich biodiversity, with 134 animal species, 105 environmental habitats, and 97 plant species protected under EU legislation[3].
- Numerous important river sources, including the Rh√¥ne, Rhine, Po, and tributaries of the Danube[4].

The Alpine region is not just a geographical area but also a cultural and economic zone, with distinctive traditions, industries, and tourism playing significant roles in its identity and development.
