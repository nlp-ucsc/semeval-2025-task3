The presidency of Colombia is subject to the following regulations:

The President of Colombia is elected by popular vote to serve a four-year term[1][3]. Key aspects of the presidential regulations include:

1. Term Limit: As of 2015, presidents are limited to serving only one four-year term[5]. Consecutive re-election is prohibited[4][5].

2. Election Process: 
   - The president is elected through direct popular vote[1][3].
   - A two-round majoritarian system is used. If no candidate receives a majority in the first round, a runoff election is held between the top two candidates[3].

3. Eligibility Requirements:
   - Candidates must be native-born Colombian citizens[1].
   - They must be at least 55 years old[1].
   - Candidates must be in full possession of their political rights[1].
   - Prior experience is required, such as service as a congressional or cabinet member, governor, government official, university professor for five years, or practicing a liberal profession requiring a university degree[1].

4. Powers and Responsibilities:
   - The president serves as both head of state and head of government[3][4].
   - They are the commander-in-chief of the armed forces[4].
   - The president is the supreme administrative authority[4].
   - They oversee the executive branch, including a 13-member cabinet and various administrative agencies[1].

5. Constitutional Constraints:
   - Presidential powers, while extensive, are subject to checks and balances from the judiciary and legislature[1].
   - The Supreme Court has the authority to review and potentially declare unconstitutional certain presidential decrees[1].

6. Inauguration:
   - The presidential inauguration takes place on August 7th every four years[5].

7. Vice President:
   - A vice president is elected on the same ticket as the president[3].

These regulations are designed to maintain a balance of power and prevent the concentration of authority in a single individual for an extended period. The one-term limit, in particular, was reinstated in 2015 to promote democratic turnover in the executive branch[5][7].
