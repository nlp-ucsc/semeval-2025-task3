The legends of the Jomsvikings are primarily recorded in several medieval Icelandic sagas and other Norse literary sources from the 12th and 13th centuries. The main historical sources include:

1. Jómsvíkinga saga: This is the primary source dedicated specifically to the Jomsvikings. Composed in Iceland during the 13th century, it provides the most detailed account of their origins, laws, and exploits[1][3].

2. King Olaf Tryggvasson's Saga: This saga contains references to the Jomsvikings and their involvement in various events[1][2].

3. Flatey Book (Flateyjarbók): This important medieval Icelandic manuscript includes stories about the Jomsvikings[2][3].

4. Heimskringla: This collection of sagas about Norwegian kings, compiled by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century, mentions the Jomsvikings and their defeat by King Magnus I of Norway[1][4].

5. Gesta Danorum: Written by Saxo Grammaticus in the early 13th century, this work provides an account of Danish history that includes information about the Jomsvikings[1].

6. Knýtlinga saga: This saga focuses on Danish kings and includes references to the Jomsvikings[1].

7. Styrbjarnar þáttr Svíakappa: This short tale mentions the Jomsvikings and their connection to Styrbjörn the Strong[1].

8. Eyrbyggja saga: Another Icelandic saga that contains references to the Jomsvikings[1].

In addition to these literary sources, there are also three contemporary runestones that are believed to refer to battles involving the Jomsvikings:

1. The Högby Runestone
2. One of the Hällestad Runestones (DR 295)
3. The Sjörup Runestone[1]

It's important to note that while these sources provide rich narratives about the Jomsvikings, historians debate their historical accuracy. The sagas were composed centuries after the events they describe and likely contain a mix of historical fact, oral tradition, and literary embellishment[2][4]. The lack of contemporary primary sources specifically mentioning the Jomsvikings or Jomsborg has made it challenging for historians to confirm many details of their existence and exploits[1][4].
