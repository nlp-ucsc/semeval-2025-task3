Walthamstow Central station is operated and managed by multiple authorities:

1. London Overground: The Overground platforms and services are managed by London Overground, which is part of Transport for London (TfL)[1][6]. London Overground operates the Weaver line services between Liverpool Street and Chingford that stop at Walthamstow Central[2][4].

2. London Underground: The underground Victoria line platforms and services are operated by London Underground, which is also part of TfL[2][4]. Walthamstow Central is the northern terminus of the Victoria line[1][2].

3. Transport for London (TfL): As the overall integrated transport authority for London, TfL has overarching responsibility for both the Overground and Underground services at the station[6]. TfL sets specifications for train frequency, station facilities, and overall performance[6].

4. Network Rail: While not directly operating services, Network Rail owns and maintains most of the track and signals for the Overground portion of the station, as it is part of the National Rail network[6].

5. Arriva Rail London: This company manages the day-to-day operations of London Overground stations and trains on behalf of TfL[6].
