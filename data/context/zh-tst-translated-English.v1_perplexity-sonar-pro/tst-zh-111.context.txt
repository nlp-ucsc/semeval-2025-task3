The etymology of the Ukrainian Kuban is closely tied to the historical settlement and cultural development of the region. Here's a detailed explanation:

The term "Kuban" primarily refers to a geographic region in southern Russia, named after the Kuban River. The etymology of the Ukrainian Kuban, however, is rooted in the history of Ukrainian settlement in this area.

Ukrainian settlement of the Kuban region began in 1792 when Empress Catherine II of Russia granted the Black Sea Cossack Host rights to these lands[2]. The Black Sea Cossacks were largely composed of former Zaporozhian Cossacks, who were of Ukrainian origin[4]. This initial settlement marked the beginning of significant Ukrainian presence in the region.

The Ukrainian character of the Kuban developed over several waves of migration:

1. The first wave occurred between 1792 and 1793, with about 25,000 people settling the area[2][4].

2. Subsequent waves followed in the early 19th century, with tens of thousands of settlers arriving from various Ukrainian regions, including Poltava, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and others[2][4].

By the late 19th century, Ukrainians constituted a majority in the region. The 1897 census showed that 83-86% of the Black Sea Cossacks in Kuban were Ukrainian[3]. This demographic dominance led to the area being considered a Ukrainian ethnographic territory, despite being politically part of the Russian Empire[6].

The Ukrainian character of the Kuban was so pronounced that during the Ukrainian Revolution of 1917-1921, many political forces considered Kuban part of a future autonomous Ukraine[3]. The region even briefly existed as the Kuban People's Republic, which attempted to establish ties with Ukraine[8][10].

The term "Ukrainian Kuban" thus refers to this historical and cultural Ukrainian presence in the region. It's worth noting that the area where Ukrainians lived in Kuban was sometimes unofficially referred to as "Raspberry Ukraine" or "Malynovyi Klyn" in Ukrainian[4].

However, due to subsequent Russian and Soviet policies, including forced Russification and the Holodomor, the Ukrainian character of the region was significantly diminished over the course of the 20th century[4][8].

In essence, the "Ukrainian Kuban" is not so much an etymological term as it is a historical and cultural concept, reflecting the significant Ukrainian presence and influence in the Kuban region from the late 18th to the early 20th centuries.
