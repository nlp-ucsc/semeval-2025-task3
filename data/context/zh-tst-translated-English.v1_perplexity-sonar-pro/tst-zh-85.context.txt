Small bamboo rats, particularly the lesser bamboo rat (Cannomys badius), are distributed across several countries and regions in South and Southeast Asia. Their range includes:

1. Nepal: Found in eastern Nepal[1][8][10].

2. India: Present in Sikkim, West Bengal, and Assam[8][10].

3. Bangladesh: Occurs in northern and eastern parts of the country[8].

4. Bhutan: The species is present here[8].

5. Myanmar (Burma): Widely distributed throughout the country[1][8].

6. China: Found in southwestern Yunnan province[1][8].

7. Vietnam: Present in northern regions[1][8].

8. Laos: The species is found here[1][8].

9. Thailand: Distributed across the country[1][8].

10. Cambodia: Occurs in northern areas[8].

The lesser bamboo rat inhabits a variety of environments within these regions, including:

- Thicket and bamboo forests[8]
- Hilly and mountainous areas, sometimes at high elevations[8]
- Grassy areas and forests[9]
- Occasionally in gardens[9]

It's worth noting that the lesser bamboo rat is more adaptable in its habitat preferences compared to other bamboo rat species. It can live in a wider range of environments and consume a more varied diet of vegetation[9]. This adaptability likely contributes to its broad distribution across South and Southeast Asia.
