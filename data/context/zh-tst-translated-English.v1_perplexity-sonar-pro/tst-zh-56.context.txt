Garajonay National Park, located on the island of La Gomera in the Canary Islands, is home to a remarkable array of unique and endemic species. This park is particularly notable for its high level of endemism, with many species found nowhere else in the world. Here are some of the unique species found in Garajonay National Park:

## Flora

The park is renowned for its laurel forest (laurisilva), a relict ecosystem from the Tertiary period. Among the 450 vascular plant species recorded:

- 34 species are endemic to La Gomera island[3]
- 8 species are found only within the national park[3]
- About 25% of the flora is endemic to the Canary Islands[6]

Some notable endemic plant species include:
- Canary laurel (Laurus azorica), the dominant tree species[6]
- Codeso, an endemic Canarian shrub with vibrant yellow flowers[4]

## Fauna

### Birds
Two emblematic bird species are endemic to the Canary Islands and largely restricted to Garajonay's laurel forests:

1. White-tailed Laurel Pigeon (Columba junoniae) - Endangered[3][6]
2. Dark-tailed Laurel Pigeon (Columba bollii)[3][6]

The park is recognized as an Important Bird Area, supporting populations of other notable species such as:
- Barbary partridges
- Plain swifts
- Eurasian sparrowhawks
- Berthelot's pipits
- Island canaries[9][10]

### Reptiles
Endemic reptile species include:

1. La Gomera giant lizard (Gallotia bravoana) - Critically Endangered[6]
2. Gomera lizard (Gallotia galloti gomerae)[6]
3. Gomera skink (Chalcides coeruleopunctatus)[6]

### Amphibians
The stripeless tree frog (Hyla meridionalis) is found in the park[9][10].

### Mammals
While most mammals in the park are introduced, there are four native bat species:

1. Long-tailed bat (Tadarida teniotis)
2. Madeira pipistrelle (Pipistrellus maderensis) - Endangered
3. Savi's pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii)
4. Western barbastelle (Barbastella barbastellus)[1]

### Invertebrates
The invertebrate fauna is exceptionally rich in endemic species:

- An estimated 40-60% of the invertebrate fauna is endemic[3][10]
- 153 species are endemic to La Gomera island[5]
- 327 species are endemic to the Canary Islands[5]

The park's unique conditions have led to highly specialized invertebrates, such as:
- Endemic grasshoppers of the genus Calliphona
- Weevils of the genus Laparocerus
- The tiny weevil Rhopalomesites euphorbiae, which feeds exclusively on the threatened Euphorbia mellifera plant[1]

This exceptional biodiversity makes Garajonay National Park a crucial refuge for many species unique to the Canary Islands and, in some cases, to this specific park, highlighting its immense conservation value.
