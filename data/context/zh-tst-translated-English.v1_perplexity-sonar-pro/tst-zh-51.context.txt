I apologize, but there appears to be some confusion in your query. The search results do not contain any information about a person named Pietro Nanni. The search results provide information about two separate individuals:

1. Nanni di Banco (c. 1374 - 1421): An Italian Renaissance sculptor from Florence.

2. Pietro Mascagni (1863 - 1945): An Italian composer primarily known for his operas.
