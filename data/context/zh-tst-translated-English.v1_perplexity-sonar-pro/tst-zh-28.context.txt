The eye socket, also known as the orbit in anatomical terms, is a bony cavity in the skull that houses and protects the eyeball and its associated structures[1][3]. Here are some key points about the eye socket:

1. Structure:
   - The eye socket is a pear-shaped or pyramidal cavity with the wider part facing outward and the narrower part (apex) pointing inward[1][2].
   - It has a volume of approximately 30 cubic centimeters (about 2 tablespoons) in adults[1][2].

2. Composition:
   - The eye socket is formed by seven bones: frontal, sphenoid, zygomatic, ethmoid, lacrimal, maxillary, and palatine[2][5].
   - These bones create four walls: roof (superior), floor (inferior), medial, and lateral walls[4].

3. Contents:
   - Besides the eyeball, the socket contains blood vessels, nerves, muscles, fat, the lacrimal gland, and other soft tissues[1][3].
   - It houses the extraocular muscles that control eye movement[5].

4. Function:
   - The primary purpose of the eye socket is to protect the delicate structures of the eye from injury[1].
   - It provides attachment points for muscles and ligaments related to eye function[4].
   - The socket also serves as a passageway for important nerves and blood vessels[5].

5. Openings:
   - The eye socket has several important openings, including the optic canal (for the optic nerve and ophthalmic artery), superior orbital fissure, and inferior orbital fissure[3][5].

In summary, the eye socket is a complex bony structure that plays a crucial role in protecting and supporting the eye and its associated structures, while also facilitating the passage of vital nerves and blood vessels.
