I apologize, but there appears to be some confusion in your query. The search results do not provide information about an athlete named Ahn Jae-hyun winning international sports events awards. Instead, the results primarily refer to two different individuals:

1. Ahn Jae-hyun: A South Korean model and actor, born on July 1, 1987. He is known for his roles in various television dramas and has won some awards for his acting performances, but not for sports[1][5].

2. An Jae-hyun: A South Korean table tennis player, born on December 25, 1999. While he has participated in international competitions, the search results do not mention any specific international awards he has won[3].

There is also brief mention of a short track speed skater named Ahn, but this appears to be a different person altogether[4].

If you're looking for information about a specific athlete's international sports awards, I would need more accurate details about the person in question, such as their full name, sport, and nationality. This would help in providing more relevant and accurate information.
