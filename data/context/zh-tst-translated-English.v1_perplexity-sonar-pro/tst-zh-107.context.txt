I apologize, but I don't have any information about an athlete named Alfred Pley or any awards they may have earned. The search results do not contain any mentions of an athlete by that name. 

However, the search results do contain information about a different athlete named Julien Alfred. If you're interested, I can provide details about Julien Alfred's recent achievements and awards:
