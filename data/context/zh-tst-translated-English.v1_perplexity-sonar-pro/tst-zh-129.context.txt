Emperor Uda of Japan favored several key individuals during his reign that contributed to the prosperity of the Kampyō era (889-898):

Sugawara no Michizane was one of Emperor Uda's most trusted advisors and played a significant role during this period[1]. As a renowned scholar, Michizane rapidly rose in rank within five years to reach the third rank in the court. He was also given supervision of the Crown Prince's household, indicating the high level of trust Emperor Uda placed in him[1].

Emperor Uda assigned Sugawara no Michizane to review prisoners in the capital and provide a general amnesty for the wrongfully accused in 896, demonstrating Michizane's influence on judicial matters[1]. Additionally, Michizane's counsel was instrumental in Emperor Uda's decision to stop sending ambassadors to China, a significant shift in foreign policy[1].

The emperor also promoted non-Fujiwara officials, mainly from the Minamoto family, to prominent ranks[1]. This move was part of Emperor Uda's efforts to reassert imperial power and reduce the influence of the powerful Fujiwara clan.

In his hortatory will left for his son and successor, Emperor Daigo, Uda praised both Fujiwara no Tokihira and Sugawara no Michizane, assigning them to look after the young emperor until he reached maturity[1]. This indicates that while Uda sought to limit Fujiwara influence, he still recognized Tokihira's capabilities as an advisor.

Emperor Uda's strategic appointments and reliance on talented individuals like Sugawara no Michizane helped create a period of relative stability and prosperity during the Kampyō era. His efforts to balance power between different factions and promote capable officials based on merit rather than family connections contributed to the effective governance of Japan during this time.
