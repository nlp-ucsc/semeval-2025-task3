The pygmy beaked whale (Mesoplodon peruvianus) was first formally described and recorded in 1991, based on specimens obtained from Peru between 1976 and 1989[1]. Specifically:

1. The species was formally described in 1991 by scientists Reyes, Mead, and Van Waerebeek[1].

2. The description was based on ten specimens obtained from Peru between 1976 and 1989[1].

3. The type specimen (the individual used to formally describe the species) was a 3.72 m (12.2 ft) adult male[1].

However, it's worth noting that there were earlier sightings and specimens that were later identified as this species:

1. A specimen that stranded at Paracas, Peru in 1955 was initially tentatively identified as Andrews' beaked whale but has since been identified as a pygmy beaked whale[1].

2. Prior to the formal classification, there were at least two dozen sightings of an unknown beaked whale named Mesoplodon sp. A, which are now believed to be synonymous with this species[1].

The pygmy beaked whale's known range has expanded since its initial discovery:

- It has primarily been recorded in the eastern tropical Pacific between Baja California and Peru[1].
- Further strandings have been recorded in Chile and as far north as Monterey Bay, California[1].
- A specimen even washed up in New Zealand, though this is considered an extralimital occurrence[1].

In summary, while there were earlier unidentified sightings and specimens, the pygmy beaked whale was first officially recorded and described as a new species in 1991, based on specimens from Peru collected between 1976 and 1989.
