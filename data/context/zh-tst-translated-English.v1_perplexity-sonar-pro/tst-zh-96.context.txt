I apologize, but I don't have any information about notable works by Ding Huiren specifically. The search results don't contain any clear references to an author or artist by that name. 

The search results do mention a few different people with similar names:

1. Ding Ling - A prominent Chinese author active in the early to mid-20th century. Some of her notable works include:
   - "Miss Sophia's Diary" (1928)
   - "When I Was in Xia Village" (1941) 
   - "In the Hospital" (1941)
   - "The Sun Shines Over Sanggan River" (1948)[1]

2. Ding Yi - A Chinese painter known for consistently using cross motifs in his paintings since the late 1980s. His works are often titled "Appearance of Crosses" followed by a date.[3]

3. Huiling Ding - A professor of English who has published academic works on technical communication and rhetoric.[2][4]

However, none of these appear to be the Ding Huiren you asked about. Without more specific information about this person, I cannot confidently provide details about their notable works. If you have any additional context about Ding Huiren, such as their field of work or time period, that could help in finding relevant information.
