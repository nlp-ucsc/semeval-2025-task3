International Klein Blue (IKB) was developed in the late 1950s through a collaboration between French artist Yves Klein and Parisian art supplier Edouard Adam[1][2]. The goal was to create a unique blue paint that preserved the luminous quality of pure ultramarine pigment while providing a stable binder for artistic use[1][3].

The key components of IKB are:

1. Pigment: Klein selected a synthetic ultramarine blue pigment, which he referred to as "pure ultramarine blue, reference 1311"[1].

2. Binder: The crucial innovation was the use of a synthetic resin binder called Rhodopas M60A, developed by the chemical company Rhône-Poulenc[1][2][4]. This polyvinyl acetate resin allowed the pigment to retain its powdery appearance and vibrant hue[1].

3. Additives: To achieve the desired consistency and drying properties, the binder was mixed with measured amounts of ethyl alcohol and ethyl acetate[1][2].

The synthesis process involved:

1. Consultation with chemists: Edouard Adam worked with chemists at Rhône-Poulenc to identify the appropriate resin and additives[1].

2. Experimentation: Klein and Adam tested various formulations to achieve the desired visual effect - a surface that appeared devoid of any binder coating the pigment[1][3].

3. Suspension of pigment: The ultramarine pigment was suspended in the Rhodopas M60A binder, which was thinned with ethanol and ethyl acetate[2][7].

The resulting paint had several unique properties:

1. Preservation of pigment luminosity: The binder's long-chain molecules enfolded the pigment particles without smothering them, maintaining their vibrant appearance[2][7].

2. Quick-drying: The paint dried rapidly to a velvet-like finish[2][7].

3. Matte texture: The high shrinkage of the resin upon drying left the pigment with a matte, spongy appearance[9].

Klein registered the IKB process in France on May 19, 1960, under Soleau envelope no. 63471[4]. While he didn't patent the color itself (as colors cannot be legally appropriated), he patented the unique combination of pigment and binder[4][5].

Today, the binder is still available for purchase under the name "Medium Adam25" from the same Paris art supply store where Klein originally obtained his materials[1][9]. However, creating a true IKB requires following Klein's specific process, and most modern versions are approximations rather than exact reproductions of the patented formula[5].
