The JL-2 (Ju Lang-2) submarine-launched ballistic missile has undergone several test launches since its development began. Here's a detailed chronology of its known test launch history:

1. Early Development (1980s-1990s):
Research and development of the JL-2 began in the mid-1980s, alongside its land-based counterpart, the DF-31[2]. The common 2-meter diameter solid rocket motor for both missiles was successfully tested in late 1983[7].

2. First At-Sea Launch (2001):
The first at-sea launch of the JL-2 occurred in mid-January 2001. This test was conducted from China's modified Golf-class trials submarine[4].

3. Subsequent Tests (2001-2004):
- Another "pop-up" test (ejecting the missile from the submarine launch tube) was carried out in October 2001[4].
- Additional tests were reportedly conducted in 2002 and 2003[4].
- The program faced a setback when a test flight failed in the summer of 2004[4].

4. Continued Testing (2005-2012):
- On June 16, 2005, China test-fired the JL-2 from a nuclear submarine near Qingdao. The warhead reportedly impacted in a desert area several thousand kilometers away[4].
- Flight testing continued through the mid-2000s[2].
- A series of test launches occurred in 2012, which appear to have been successful[2][4].

5. Recent Tests:
- In August 2012, China conducted a cycle of testing that was reportedly successful, marking a significant milestone after previous failures[2].
- As of 2015, the missile was considered to have entered service[10].

6. Operational Deployment:
- By December 2015, Type 094 submarines began deterrence patrols with JL-2 missiles[7].
- As of 2017, 48 JL-2 launchers were deployed on submarines[7].

7. Latest Developments:
- In April 2024, the Chinese navy released a video showing the launch of a JL-2 ballistic missile from a nuclear submarine, demonstrating its second-strike capability[1].

It's worth noting that China has been secretive about its missile programs, and not all tests may have been publicly reported. The development of the JL-2 has been a long-term project for China, spanning several decades, with the missile finally providing China with its first credible sea-based nuclear deterrent[7].

Currently, the JL-2 is deployed on Type 094 Jin-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs). China operates six of these submarines, each capable of carrying up to 12 JL-2 missiles[1][9]. The successful development and deployment of the JL-2 represent a significant advancement in China's nuclear capabilities, allowing for a more robust nuclear triad and enhanced strategic deterrence.
