Cedric Liddell, a Canadian rower, achieved the following notable awards and accomplishments:

1. Olympic Bronze Medal: Cedric Liddell won a bronze medal in the coxed eights event at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics[6][7]. He was part of the Canadian team that finished third, just 0.4 seconds ahead of the British crew in the final[7].

2. Multiple Henley Royal Regatta Victories: As a member of the Hamilton, Ontario's Leander Boat Club crew, Liddell won Canada's Henley Royal Regatta every year from 1932 through 1936[7].

3. Olympic Participation: In addition to his bronze medal in 1932, Liddell also represented Canada at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, competing in the eights event[6][7]. However, the team was eliminated in the opening round[7].

4. Continued Competitive Success: After the 1936 Olympics, Liddell switched to competing in pairs and continued to be active in rowing competitions into the 1940s[7].

While not an award per se, it's worth noting that Liddell's athletic career extended beyond his Olympic achievements. He later became involved in coaching, working with the Brockville Rowing Club in Ontario after World War II[7].
