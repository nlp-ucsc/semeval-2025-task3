Erik Gunnar Asplund (1885-1940) was a prominent Swedish architect whose life and work significantly influenced modern Scandinavian architecture. His main life experiences include:

1. Education and Early Career:
Asplund began his creative journey by studying painting at the Royal Institute of Art in Stockholm in the early 20th century[2]. He later shifted his focus to architecture, studying at the Royal Institute of Technology[1][2]. After completing his education, Asplund opened his own architectural studio in 1913[2][3].

2. Architectural Influences:
Early in his career, Asplund was heavily influenced by neoclassical architecture. This influence was reinforced by his travels to Greece and Italy between 1913 and 1914[6]. These trips had a profound impact on his early architectural style.

3. Major Projects:
Throughout his career, Asplund worked on several significant projects that showcased his evolving style:

- Stockholm Public Library (1924-1928): This project is considered a prototypical example of Nordic Classicism and the Swedish Grace movement[1][4].
- Gothenburg City Hall Extension (1913-1937): This project demonstrates Asplund's transition from neoclassical to functionalist architecture[1][4].
- Skogskyrkogården (Woodland Cemetery) in Stockholm (1914-1940): A collaboration with Sigurd Lewerentz, this UNESCO World Heritage site is one of Asplund's most renowned works[1][3].

4. Stockholm International Exhibition (1930):
Asplund served as the Chief Architect for this watershed event, which is credited with introducing modernism to Swedish society[3]. His contributions, including the Paradise Café and Entry Pavilion, were particularly influential[2][3].

5. Academic Career:
Following the success of the Stockholm Exhibition, Asplund became a professor of architecture at the Royal Institute of Technology in 1931[1][3]. His appointment was marked by a significant lecture titled "Our architectonic concept of space"[1].

6. Shift to Modernism:
In the last decade of his life, Asplund became a major proponent of the modernist style in Sweden[1][4]. This shift is evident in his later works, which embraced functionalism and were influenced by architects like Le Corbusier[4][6].

7. Furniture Design:
In addition to his architectural work, Asplund also designed furniture. Notable pieces include the 'GA-2' chair, the 'Karmstol' chair, and the 'Gothenburg' chair[2][3].

8. Final Major Work:
The Woodland Crematorium at Stockholm South Cemetery (1935-1940) is considered Asplund's finest work and one of the masterpieces of modern architecture[1][6].

Throughout his career, Asplund designed 68 projects, of which 32 were constructed[6]. His work spanned various types of buildings, including airports, schools, housing, shops, restaurants, and mausoleums. Asplund's life and work served as inspiration for many Scandinavian design luminaries, including Alvar Aalto and Arne Jacobsen[3]. His contributions to architecture earned him the title of "high priest of functionalism in Sweden" by the Architectural Review magazine[6].
