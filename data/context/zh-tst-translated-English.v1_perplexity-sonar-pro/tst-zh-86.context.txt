Saint Isidore's Church was built against a backdrop of early 20th century Catholic expansion and community growth in California. Here are the key historical details:

The parish of St. Isidore was officially established on April 20, 1910 in Danville, California[4]. This was during a period of Catholic parish expansion in the region, as prior to 1921, only five parishes had been established in Orange County[1].

The historical context for the church's founding dates back to the Spanish colonial era:

1. The area was originally part of the Mission San Jose territory, founded in 1797 by Franciscan missionaries[4].

2. After Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1836, church properties in California were secularized[4].

3. California became part of the United States following the U.S.-Mexican War of 1846[4].

4. In the late 19th century, Catholic presence in the area grew, with the first Mass celebrated in Green Valley in 1875[4].

5. By 1910, the valley had attracted many farmers and ranchers, leading to the founding of St. Isidore parish[4].

The church was named after Saint Isidore the Farmer, chosen as the patron due to the agricultural nature of the Danville area at the time[4]. The parish initially gathered for Sunday Mass at the Grange Hall in Danville[10].

Construction of the original St. Isidore's church building began in 1911:

1. The church was built in the Mission style of architecture[10].
2. It was a frame building with a seating capacity of 300[10].
3. In 1913, a bell tower was added to the original structure[10].

The parish boundaries were initially very expansive, covering a large area including parts of Livermore, Pleasanton, Hayward, Oakland, Moraga Valley, Orinda, and the eastern slopes of Mount Diablo[10].

Over the years, the church underwent several expansions and renovations to accommodate the growing congregation. A new, larger church building was completed in 1961 to replace the original structure, which was razed in 1963[10].

This historical background reflects the growth of Catholic communities in California during the early 20th century, as well as the agricultural heritage of the region that influenced the choice of Saint Isidore as the church's patron.
