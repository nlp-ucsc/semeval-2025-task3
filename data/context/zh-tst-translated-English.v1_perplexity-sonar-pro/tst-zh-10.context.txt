Type 2 diabetes can lead to several serious complications if not properly managed. The main complications include:

## Cardiovascular issues

People with type 2 diabetes are at higher risk of cardiovascular problems, including:

- Heart disease and heart attacks
- Stroke 
- High blood pressure (hypertension)
- Atherosclerosis (narrowing of blood vessels)[1][5]

These cardiovascular complications are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes. Proper blood sugar control and management of other risk factors like high blood pressure are crucial for prevention.

## Eye problems 

Diabetes can damage the blood vessels in the retina, leading to:

- Diabetic retinopathy
- Cataracts
- Glaucoma
- Vision loss and blindness[1][3][5]

Regular eye exams are important for early detection and treatment of these issues.

## Kidney disease

High blood sugar levels can damage the kidneys over time, potentially causing:

- Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
- Kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplant[2][3][6]

About 1 in 3 adults with diabetes develops CKD. Controlling blood sugar and blood pressure helps protect kidney function.

## Nerve damage (neuropathy)

Diabetes can lead to various types of nerve damage:

- Peripheral neuropathy affecting the feet and legs, causing numbness, pain, and increased risk of infections and ulcers
- Autonomic neuropathy affecting internal organs, potentially causing digestive issues, sexual dysfunction, and other problems[1][3][5]

## Foot problems

Due to nerve damage and reduced blood flow, people with diabetes are at higher risk of:

- Foot ulcers and infections
- Slow-healing wounds
- Amputation in severe cases[1][5]

Daily foot checks and proper foot care are essential for prevention.

## Other complications

Additional potential complications of type 2 diabetes include:

- Skin and mouth infections
- Hearing impairment
- Increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia
- Depression
- Gastroparesis (delayed stomach emptying)
- Fatty liver disease[6][7][8]

## Prevention and management

While these complications are serious, they can often be prevented or delayed through:

- Maintaining good blood sugar control
- Regular medical check-ups and screenings
- Managing blood pressure and cholesterol levels
- Following a healthy diet and exercise regimen
- Not smoking
- Taking prescribed medications as directed[5][8]

Early detection and treatment of complications is crucial for minimizing their impact on health and quality of life. People with type 2 diabetes should work closely with their healthcare team to develop an effective management plan tailored to their individual needs.
