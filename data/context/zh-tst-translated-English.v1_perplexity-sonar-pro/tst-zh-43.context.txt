Agistri is a small island located in the Saronic Gulf of Greece[1][2][5]. Here are some key details about its location:

- It is part of the Saronic Islands group in the Aegean Sea[1][5].
- Agistri is situated very close to the larger Saronic island of Aegina[1][3].
- The island lies between the Attica peninsula (where Athens is located) and the eastern coast of the Peloponnese peninsula[5].
- It is approximately 55-60 minutes away from the port of Piraeus in Athens by high-speed ferry[3][4].
- Agistri belongs to the Islands regional unit, which is part of the Attica administrative region of Greece[1].

The island's strategic location in the Saronic Gulf makes it easily accessible from Athens, contributing to its popularity as a weekend getaway destination for Athenians and tourists alike[3][5]. Despite its proximity to the bustling capital, Agistri offers a tranquil, pine-covered landscape with beautiful beaches, providing a stark contrast to urban life[2][3].
