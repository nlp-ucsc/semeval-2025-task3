Yushu City, located in Qinghai Province, China, comprises four subdistricts under its jurisdiction[1]:

1. Gyêgu Subdistrict (结古街道, Jiégǔ Jiēdào)
2. Zhaxike Subdistrict (扎西科街道, Zhāxīkē Jiēdào)
3. Xihang Subdistrict (西杭街道, Xīháng Jiēdào)
4. Xinzhai Subdistrict (新寨街道, Xīnzhài Jiēdào)

These subdistricts form the urban core of Yushu City, which is the seat of the larger Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. Gyêgu Subdistrict, also known as Jiegu, serves as the main urban center and is often referred to simply as "Yushu" due to its role as the city seat[1].

In addition to these subdistricts, Yushu City also includes two towns and six townships, forming a complete administrative structure that combines urban and rural areas[1]. The city is an important cultural and economic center in the region, known for its Tibetan heritage and as a hub for trade and transportation in southwestern Qinghai Province.
