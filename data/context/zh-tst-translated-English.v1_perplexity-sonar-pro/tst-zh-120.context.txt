The Infiniti G series uses a powerful V6 engine paired with either an automatic or manual transmission, depending on the specific model and year:

Engine:
The G37 models feature a 3.7-liter VQ37VHR V6 engine with VVEL (Variable Valve Event and Lift) technology[1][5]. This engine produces:

- 328 horsepower at 7,000 rpm
- 269 lb-ft of torque at 5,200 rpm

Key engine features include:
- DOHC 24-valve design
- Aluminum construction
- Variable valve timing (CVTCS)
- 7,600 rpm redline
- Electronic drive-by-wire throttle system

Transmission:
The G37 offers two transmission options[1][5]:

1. 7-speed automatic transmission:
   - Standard on G37 Journey and G37x AWD models
   - Features Downshift Rev Matching
   - Drive Sport (DS) mode with Adaptive Shift Control (ASC)
   - Optional paddle shifters (part of Sport Package)

2. 6-speed manual transmission:
   - Available on G37 Sport 6MT model
   - Close-ratio gearing for sporty performance

The powertrain is mounted in a front-midship (FM) layout, which places the engine behind the front axle for improved weight distribution[2]. Rear-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive (ATTESA E-TS system) available on G37x AWD models[5].

This combination of a high-revving V6 engine and choice of transmissions allows the Infiniti G to deliver responsive acceleration and engaging performance, positioning it as a competitive option in the luxury sports sedan segment.
