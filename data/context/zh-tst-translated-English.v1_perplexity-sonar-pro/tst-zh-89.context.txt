Adult Concave-eared Torrent Frogs (Odorrana tormota) live in fast-flowing streams and the surrounding habitats in mountainous areas of eastern China[2]. Specifically:

1. Their distribution is restricted to the Huangshan Mountains in Anhui province and Jiande and Anji counties in northern Zhejiang province[2].

2. These frogs prefer habitats adjacent to rapidly moving water, which produces constant low-frequency background noise[2][8]. This noisy environment is likely why they have evolved the ability to communicate using ultrasonic frequencies.

3. They reside in vegetation along permanent streams and waterfalls running through mountains and hills, in subtropical/tropical moist lowland forest and shrubland habitats[5].

4. During the day, they shelter in moist rock crevices[5]. At night, they can be found in thick brush alongside streams[5].

5. Adult males are territorial and call from low vegetation adjacent to noisy streams, typically spacing themselves about 1.5 meters apart[5].

The Concave-eared Torrent Frog's habitat preferences are closely tied to its unique adaptations, including its ability to produce and perceive ultrasonic calls, which allows it to communicate effectively in its noisy stream environment[2][8]. This species' specific habitat requirements make it particularly vulnerable to environmental changes, especially those affecting stream habitats and surrounding vegetation.
