The British commanders and leaders in the Battle of Long Island were:

1. General William Howe: He was the overall commander of the British forces[3][8].

2. Admiral Lord Richard Howe: William Howe's elder brother, who commanded the British naval forces[3].

3. Lieutenant General Henry Clinton: He led one of the main attacking columns and played a crucial role in the British flanking maneuver[1][4][6].

4. Lord Charles Cornwallis: He commanded troops alongside Clinton in the initial landing and subsequent attack[1][4][6].

5. Major General James Grant: He led a division that included the 6th Brigade and made a diversionary attack on the American right flank[7].

6. Brigadier General James Agnew: He commanded the 6th Brigade under Grant's division[7].

7. Lieutenant General Hugh Percy (Earl Percy): He commanded the second line of British forces[7].

8. Major General Valentine Jones: He led the 3rd Brigade in the second line[7].

9. Major General James Robertson: He was part of Clinton's command structure[7].

These British leaders coordinated their efforts in a complex battle plan that involved multiple columns of attack, including a flanking maneuver through the undefended Jamaica Pass, which ultimately led to their victory over the American forces commanded by George Washington[1][4][6].
