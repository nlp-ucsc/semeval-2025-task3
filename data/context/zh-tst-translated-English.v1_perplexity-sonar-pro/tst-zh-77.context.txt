The Japanese era name Genkyō (元享) began on February 29, 1321, in the Gregorian calendar[3]. 

To provide more context:

1. The Japanese calendar system has used era names (nengō or gengō) since the 7th century, with each era typically corresponding to the reign of an emperor[9].

2. These era names are used alongside the Gregorian calendar in Japan, providing a unique way of marking time periods in Japanese history and culture[5].

3. The conversion between Japanese era dates and Gregorian dates can be complex due to the historical use of the lunar calendar and various calendar reforms in Japan[3].

4. The Genkyō era was a relatively short period in Japanese history, lasting from 1321 to 1324 during the Kamakura period[3].

5. It's worth noting that Japan officially adopted the Gregorian calendar on January 1, 1873, during the Meiji period[1]. Prior to this, Japan used a lunar calendar system, which makes precise date conversions for earlier periods somewhat challenging.

6. The adoption of the Gregorian calendar in 1873 caused some confusion at the time, as it resulted in a sudden jump in dates. The day before the change was December 2, 1872, in the old calendar, and the next day became January 1, 1873, in the new Gregorian system[1].

Understanding these historical calendar changes is crucial for accurately interpreting dates in Japanese historical documents and for comprehending the cultural significance of era names in Japanese society.
