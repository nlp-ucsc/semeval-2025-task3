I apologize, but I don't have any reliable information about celebrities who died specifically in 485 BC. The concept of "celebrities" as we understand it today didn't really exist in ancient times, and historical records from that far back are often incomplete or unreliable. 

Additionally, the search results provided don't contain any relevant information about deaths in 485 BC. They mostly relate to more recent events and unrelated topics.

For ancient historical figures, we typically have more reliable information about rulers, philosophers, and military leaders rather than "celebrities" in the modern sense. However, even for these prominent figures, precise dates of death from that era are often uncertain.

If you're interested in notable people from around that time period in ancient history, I could provide some information about key figures from the 5th century BC in general, though exact death dates may not be known. Would that be helpful?
