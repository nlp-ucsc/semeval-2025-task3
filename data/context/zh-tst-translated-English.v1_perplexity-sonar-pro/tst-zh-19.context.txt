There seems to be a misunderstanding in your question. The term "collage" refers to an art technique of assembling different forms to create a new whole. I believe you meant to ask about "college" instead, which refers to higher education institutions. Let me provide information about the different types of colleges and schools within colleges:

Colleges are post-secondary educational institutions that offer various academic programs and degrees. Within the broader category of colleges, there are several types:

1. Liberal Arts Colleges: These institutions offer a wide range of courses in the arts, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences[2]. They typically provide four-year bachelor's degree programs and focus on developing critical thinking and broad knowledge across disciplines.

2. Universities: These are larger institutions that offer both undergraduate and graduate degrees[2]. Universities often contain several smaller colleges or schools within them, such as:

   - College of Arts and Sciences
   - School of Engineering
   - School of Business
   - College of Education
   - School of Medicine
   - School of Law

3. Community Colleges: These are two-year institutions that offer associate degrees and certificates[2]. They often serve as a stepping stone to four-year colleges and universities.

4. Vocational-Technical and Career Colleges: These institutions focus on specialized training in specific industries or careers, such as culinary arts, firefighting, or dental hygiene[2].

5. Specialized Colleges: Some colleges focus on particular areas of study or student populations, including:
   - Arts Colleges
   - Single-Sex Colleges
   - Religiously Affiliated Colleges
   - Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)
   - Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs)[2]

Within a college or university, you'll typically find various schools or departments that focus on specific academic disciplines. For example, Arizona State University includes the following colleges and schools[4]:

- W. P. Carey School of Business
- Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts
- Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering
- School of Global Futures

The specific schools and colleges within an institution can vary widely depending on the size and focus of the university or college. When choosing a college, it's important to consider factors such as the type of institution, available programs, size, location, and cost to find the best fit for your educational goals and preferences[5].
