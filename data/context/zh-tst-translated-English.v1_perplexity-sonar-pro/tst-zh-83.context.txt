An oval is an elongated, rounded shape that resembles an egg or an ellipse[1][2]. It is characterized by having a smooth, continuous curve with no sharp corners or angles. The oval shape is wider in the middle and tapers towards the ends, though not necessarily symmetrically[2].

More specifically, an oval can be described as:

1. A closed, two-dimensional figure with a curved outline
2. Similar to an ellipse, but potentially less mathematically precise
3. Having two axes of symmetry - one along its length and one across its width
4. Typically longer than it is wide, with a distinct "long" and "short" axis

In mathematical terms, an oval in a projective plane is defined as a set of points where no three are collinear (in a straight line), and there is a unique tangent line at each point[2].

The term "oval" is used in various contexts:

1. In geometry and mathematics to describe shapes and curves
2. In sports, to refer to oval-shaped fields or tracks used for racing or athletic events[1][5]
3. In architecture and design, for oval-shaped structures or elements
4. In everyday language, to describe objects or forms that have an egg-like or elliptical appearance

It's worth noting that while all ellipses are ovals, not all ovals are necessarily perfect ellipses. The term "oval" can sometimes be used more loosely to describe shapes that are generally rounded and elongated, even if they don't conform to a strict mathematical definition.
