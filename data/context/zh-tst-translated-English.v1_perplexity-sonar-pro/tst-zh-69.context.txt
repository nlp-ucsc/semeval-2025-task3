The Autonomous Province of Korçë, also known as the Republic of Korçë, had a significant historical relationship with France during World War I. This relationship was characterized by French military control, administrative oversight, and cultural influence in the region. Here are the key aspects of their historical connection:

## Establishment and Administration

The Autonomous Province of Korçë was established on December 10, 1916, under French military protection[1][3]. This came about after the city of Korçë fell under French control due to developments in the Macedonian Front of World War I[3]. The French colonel Henri Descoins, with the approval of General Maurice Sarrail, declared the Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë and appointed Themistokli Gërmenji as prefect[3].

The administration of the province was overseen by French delegated governors:
- Henri Descoins (December 10, 1916 – May 11, 1917)
- Salle (1917–1919)
- Reynard Lespinasse (June 1919 – May 26, 1920)[3]

## Governance and Reforms

The French introduced various reforms to improve local governance in Korçë:

1. They established a framework for a modern administrative system.
2. Municipal councils were created.
3. New laws and regulations were implemented to ensure justice and order[3].

The province was governed by an Administrative Council consisting of 14 members, equally divided between Christians and Muslims[3]. This structure was later replaced by an Advisory Council with 12 members in September 1917[3].

## Cultural and Educational Impact

France had a significant influence on education and culture in Korçë:

1. The French promoted Albanian nationalism by closing Greek schools and opening Albanian ones[1][2].
2. They established the Albanian National Lyceum (Le lycée de Korça) in 1917, which was the first Albanian high school open to students of all faiths[3].
3. French was introduced as an official language alongside Albanian[3].

## Military Aspects

The French military played a crucial role in the province:

1. They provided military protection to the autonomous province[3].
2. A special unit of "Albanian gendarmerie mobile" was established under French authority[3].
3. The French army used local volunteers to fight against Austria-Hungary and employed thousands of laborers to build roads in the region[4].

## Diplomatic Implications

The establishment of the Autonomous Province of Korçë had diplomatic repercussions:

1. It created tensions between France and Italy, as Italy viewed it as a violation of the Treaty of London[3].
2. Austria-Hungary and Italy used the French precedent in Korçë to justify their own protectorates in other parts of Albania[3].

## Conclusion and Aftermath

The Autonomous Province of Korçë lasted until 1920 when the French army left on June 15[3]. Even after its dissolution, French influence remained strong in Korçë:

1. The Albanian National Lyceum continued to operate until 1939[3].
2. A French Military Cemetery was built and still exists in the city today[3][5].

The Autonomous Province of Korçë is often cited as an early example of international administration and intervention, showcasing France's role in shaping the region's governance, education, and culture during a critical period of Albanian history[3].
