Based on the search results provided, I don't have enough information to definitively state which specific awards athlete Kalevi Louhivuori has won. However, I can provide some relevant information about Kalevi Louhivuori's musical accomplishments:

Kalevi Louhivuori is primarily known as a musician, specifically a trumpeter, composer, arranger, producer, keyboardist, and singer[5]. He is not mentioned as an athlete in the given search results.

Some of his notable musical achievements include:

1. His group SUN Trio won the Young Nordic Jazz Comets competition in 2006[8].

2. He received a soloist award, though the specific name of the award is not mentioned. The justification for this award stated: "An overwhelmingly unique soloist who brings new dimensions to his instrument, both technically and musically."[10]

3. In 2002, Kesko awarded scholarships to young promising athletes and art students. A Kalevi Louhivuori is listed as receiving 1000 (presumably euros or Finnish marks) from the Sibelius Academy[4]. However, it's not explicitly clear if this is the same Kalevi Louhivuori or if this was for athletic or musical achievement.

While these accomplishments are noteworthy, I don't have specific information about athletic awards won by Kalevi Louhivuori. The search results primarily focus on his musical career rather than any athletic pursuits.
