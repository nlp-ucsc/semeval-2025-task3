I apologize, but I do not have any information about the distribution of "Gresslyichthys" in the provided search results or in my existing knowledge. This appears to be an unfamiliar or possibly fictional genus name that is not mentioned in any of the given sources. The search results contain information about various other species and their distributions, but nothing specifically about Gresslyichthys. Without reliable information, I cannot provide an accurate answer about where this genus might be distributed.
