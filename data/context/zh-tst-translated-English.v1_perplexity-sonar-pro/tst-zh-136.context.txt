Feng Kai, a short track speed skater from the People's Republic of China, has won two Olympic bronze medals in his career[1][3][5]. 

Specifically, Feng Kai's Olympic medals are:

1. Bronze medal in the 5,000 meters relay at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan[1].
2. Bronze medal in the 5,000 meters relay at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, USA[1].

Both of these medals were won as part of the Chinese men's short track speed skating team in the 5,000 meters relay event[1]. 

In addition to his medal-winning performances, Feng Kai also competed in individual events at the Olympics. At the 1998 Winter Olympics, he participated in the 500 meters and 1,000 meters events, finishing 14th and 18th respectively[1]. At the 2002 Winter Olympics, he improved his performance in the 500 meters event, finishing 4th, and placed 10th in the 1,000 meters event[1].

It's worth noting that Feng Kai's Olympic career spanned two Winter Games, demonstrating his consistency and longevity as a top-level short track speed skater for China[3].
