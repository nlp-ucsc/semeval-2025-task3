The brown-headed crow (Corvus fuscicapillus) is found in specific habitats in eastern Indonesia. Its primary habitats include:

1. Subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests[4]. This species primarily inhabits virgin forest areas.

2. Subtropical or tropical mangrove forests[4]. It can also be found in mangrove habitats.

3. Secondary growth forests[4]. While it prefers primary forests, the brown-headed crow also utilizes areas of secondary forest growth.

The brown-headed crow generally avoids open countryside and coastal areas[4]. It has a fragmented distribution across its range, which may indicate some specialized habitat requirements that are not yet fully understood[4].

Specifically, this crow species can be found in the following locations:

- Northern Papua in the lower Mamberamo River Valley
- The Nimbokrang region near Jayapura
- Islands of Waigeo and Gemien in western Papua
- Aru Islands in Maluku province[4]

The brown-headed crow typically inhabits areas up to an elevation of about 500 meters (1,600 feet) above sea level[4]. It is most commonly observed moving through the forest canopy, either alone, in pairs, or occasionally in small groups[4].

It's important to note that this species has a limited range and is considered near-threatened due to habitat destruction. Its total area of occupancy is estimated to be only about 18,400 kmÂ² (7,100 sq mi)[4].
