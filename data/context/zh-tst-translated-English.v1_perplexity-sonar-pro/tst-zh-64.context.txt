I apologize, but I do not have any specific information about towns or cities bordering Hautemetz-sur-Saâne, France. In fact, I cannot find any definitive information confirming the existence of a place called "Hautemetz-sur-Saâne" in France.

There are a few possibilities to consider:

1. The name may be misspelled or refer to a very small locality not commonly listed in geographic databases.

2. It could be a confusion with a similar-sounding place name. For example, there is a commune called Val-de-Saâne in the Seine-Maritime department of Normandy, France[4]. However, this is not an exact match to the name provided in the query.

3. If the place does exist, it's likely to be a very small village or hamlet that doesn't have much information readily available about its neighboring towns.

Without more accurate information about the location or correct spelling of the place name, I cannot provide details about bordering towns or cities. If you have any additional information about this location or can clarify the name, I'd be happy to assist further in researching the surrounding areas.
