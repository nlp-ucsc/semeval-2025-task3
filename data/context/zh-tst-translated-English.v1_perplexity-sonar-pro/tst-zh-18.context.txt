I apologize, but there appears to be some confusion in your query. The "sea raven" and the "common raven" are two distinct species with very different habitats and behaviors. Let me clarify the information for each:

Common Raven (Corvus corax):

The common raven is a large, intelligent bird that often dwells on cliffs, but is not aquatic. Here are some key behaviors and habits:

1. Nesting: Common ravens build their nests on cliffs, in trees, and on structures such as power-line towers, telephone poles, billboards, and bridges[7]. Cliff nests are usually under a rock overhang for protection[7].

2. Diet: Ravens are omnivorous and highly opportunistic feeders. Their diet may include carrion, small mammals, birds, eggs, insects, amphibians, reptiles, grains, berries, and human food waste[4][5]. They are known to cache or hide food for later consumption[5].

3. Social Behavior: Ravens are highly social birds that often form tight-knit family groups. They work cooperatively when hunting, foraging, and raising young[5].

4. Intelligence: Ravens are among the most intelligent birds, capable of problem-solving, recognizing individual humans and ravens, and even using tools[3].

5. Communication: Ravens have a complex system of vocalizations, with over 30 distinct calls documented in Alaska[3]. They can mimic sounds from their environment, including human speech[5].

6. Flight: Ravens are excellent fliers, engaging in aerial acrobatics and sometimes soaring to great heights[3]. They often perform impressive flight displays during mating season[5].

7. Play: Ravens exhibit playful behaviors, such as sliding down snow banks, playing with objects in flight, and engaging in games like tug-of-war[3][6].

Sea Raven (Hemitripterus americanus):

The sea raven, on the other hand, is actually a fish species, not a bird. It's also known as the Atlantic sea raven or the ocean pout. Here are some of its behaviors:

1. Habitat: Sea ravens are bottom-dwelling fish found in the North Atlantic Ocean[9].

2. Diet: They are voracious carnivores, eating small fish and invertebrates, including crustaceans, molluscs, sea urchins, other echinoderms, and worms[9].

3. Behavior: As a fish species, its behaviors are very different from those of the common raven bird. It does not build nests on cliffs or exhibit the complex social behaviors of the common raven.

In conclusion, the cliff-dwelling behaviors you're asking about are associated with the common raven bird, not the sea raven fish. The common raven is a highly adaptable, intelligent, and social bird species that often nests on cliffs and exhibits a wide range of complex behaviors.
