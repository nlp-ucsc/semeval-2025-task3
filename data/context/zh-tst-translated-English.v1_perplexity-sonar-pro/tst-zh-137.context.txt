In the tradition of Chinese Buddhism, Dharma names and titles follow specific customs and practices:

Dharma names are given to both lay practitioners and monastics in Chinese Buddhism. These names serve several purposes:

1. Severance of family ties: The adoption of a Dharma name signifies the practitioner's dedication to Buddhist teachings and a symbolic break from familial bonds[4].

2. Lineage identification: Dharma names often reflect the lineage or school of Buddhism the practitioner belongs to[3].

3. Generational markers: In some traditions, Dharma names include characters that indicate the practitioner's generation within a lineage[1].

The naming customs in Chinese Buddhism include:

## Monastic Naming System

Chinese Buddhist monastics typically receive multiple names throughout their spiritual journey:

1. Tonsure name (法號 - fǎhào):
   - Given when a person becomes a novice monastic
   - Also called the "outer name" as it's used publicly
   - Includes the Buddhist surname "Shi" (釋)[4]

2. Ordination name (戒名 - jièmíng):
   - Received during full ordination as a bhikkhu/bhikkhuni
   - Also called the "inner name" or "precept name"
   - Used primarily by one's master[3]

3. Dharma transmission name:
   - Given upon receiving Dharma transmission
   - Represents the practitioner's place in the Dharma lineage
   - Replaces the ordination name in formal usage[3]

## Lay Practitioner Naming

Lay Buddhists who have taken refuge may also receive a Dharma name, though the practice is less formalized than for monastics[1].

## Buddhist Surname

Since the 4th century, the standard Buddhist surname has been "Shi" (釋), which is derived from "Shijiamouni," the Chinese transliteration of Shakyamuni[4]. This practice was introduced by the monk Dao'an around 370 CE and became widespread after 385 CE[4].

## Lineage and Generation Markers

Some Buddhist schools use specific characters in Dharma names to indicate lineage and generation:

1. Shared characters: Disciples of the same teacher may share a common character in their names[1].
2. Generational poems: Some traditions use characters from a specific poem to name successive generations. For example, the Shaolin Temple uses a 70-character poem, with each generation taking names starting with the next character in sequence[7].

## Multiple Dharma Names

It's common for Buddhist practitioners, especially well-known teachers, to have multiple Dharma names throughout their lives, each representing a different stage of their spiritual journey[7].

## Regional Variations

While these practices are common in Chinese Buddhism, there are variations across different regions and schools. For instance, some Pure Land sects use specific naming conventions, such as the name "Miao-Yin" for practitioners who haven't yet received a personal Dharma name from a teacher[7].

In summary, Dharma names in Chinese Buddhism serve as spiritual identifiers, lineage markers, and symbols of commitment to Buddhist practice. The naming system is complex and multifaceted, reflecting the rich traditions and hierarchies within Chinese Buddhist culture.
