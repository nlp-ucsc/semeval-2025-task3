Choe Ryong-hae has held several high-ranking positions in the North Korean government and ruling Workers' Party of Korea (WPK). His key roles include:

1. Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly and First Vice President of the State Affairs Commission (since April 2019)[1][2]. In this role, he was briefly considered the nominal head of state of North Korea before constitutional changes transferred this position to Kim Jong Un.

2. Member of the Presidium of the Politburo and Vice Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea[1][2].

3. Director of the WPK Organization Guidance Department (OGD) (appointed in October 2017)[5][9]. This is a powerful position overseeing personnel and state affairs.

4. Vice Chairman of the State Affairs Commission (elected in June 2016)[9].

5. Director of the Korean People's Army (KPA) General Political Department from 2012 to 2014[8][9]. This made him the political boss of North Korea's armed forces.

6. Vice Marshal of the Korean People's Army (appointed in April 2012)[2].

7. Member of the WPK Central Military Commission[2][9].

8. Secretary for military affairs in the WPK (appointed in September 2010)[2].

9. Chief Secretary of the North Hwanghae WPK Provincial Committee (2006-2010)[9].

10. Chairman of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission (appointed in September 2014)[9].

Throughout his career, Choe has experienced both promotions and demotions, including periods of "re-education" in 2014 and 2015[9]. Despite these fluctuations, he has consistently remained one of the most powerful officials in North Korea's formal hierarchy, often considered the second or third-ranking official after Kim Jong Un[1][2][4].
