The Emden light cruiser was equipped with the following weapons:

Main armament:
- 8 x 15 cm (5.9 inch) SK L/45 guns in single turrets[1][3]

These were the primary weapons of the Emden. Initially intended to have 15 cm SK L/55 guns in twin turrets, the Allied powers mandated the use of existing stocks of 15 cm SK L/45 guns in single turrets instead[1]. These guns fired 45 kg (99 lb) shells with a muzzle velocity of 835 m/s (2,740 ft/s) and had a maximum range of 17,600 m (57,700 ft)[1].

Secondary armament:
- 2-3 x 8.8 cm (3.5 inch) SK L/45 anti-aircraft guns[1][2]

Anti-aircraft armament (upgraded over time):
- 2-4 x 3.7 cm SK C/30 guns (added in 1938)[1]
- Up to 18 x 2 cm Flak guns (added progressively)[1]

Torpedo tubes:
- Initially 4 x 50 cm (20 inch) torpedo tubes[1]
- Later replaced with 4 x 53.3 cm (21 inch) torpedo tubes in 1934[1]
- By 1942, only 2 torpedo launchers remained[1]

Additional capabilities:
- Capacity to carry 120 naval mines (added in 1938)[1]

The armament of the Emden underwent several modifications throughout its service life:

1. In 1942, the ship was rearmed with new 15 cm Tbts KC/36 guns, designed for destroyers. These fired a 40 kg (88 lb) shell at a higher muzzle velocity of 875 m/s (2,870 ft/s) with an increased range of 23,500 m (77,100 ft)[1].

2. By 1945, the anti-aircraft battery consisted of nine 3.7 cm guns and six 2 cm guns[1].

3. Some sources indicate that in 1944, further modifications were made, including the addition of 105 mm/42 SK C/32 guns and 40 mm/56 FlaK 28 guns[4].

It's worth noting that the Emden's armament was considered somewhat outdated compared to contemporary cruisers, as it was armed with surplus World War I-era guns initially. However, the ship underwent multiple upgrades throughout its service to improve its combat capabilities, particularly in anti-aircraft defense.
