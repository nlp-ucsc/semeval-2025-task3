Chengjiang City, located in Yuxi, Yunnan Province, China, has the following administrative divisions:

1. 2 subdistricts:
   - Fenglu (凤麓街道)
   - Longjie (龙街街道)

2. 4 towns:
   - Yousuo (右所镇)
   - Yangzong (阳宗镇)
   - Haikou (海口镇)
   - Jiucun (九村镇)

Chengjiang City is a county-level city under the administration of Yuxi City[3]. It's worth noting that Chengjiang was previously a county but has been upgraded to a county-level city, which is reflected in its current administrative structure combining both urban subdistricts and rural towns[3].

This administrative division allows Chengjiang to manage both its more urbanized areas through the subdistricts and its surrounding rural areas through the towns. Such a structure is common in Chinese county-level cities, which often serve as transitional areas between urban and rural regions.
