Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) issued the world's first 150-dollar denomination banknote in September 2009[1][2]. This commemorative banknote was released to mark the 150th anniversary of Standard Chartered's Hong Kong branch. 

Some key details about this unique banknote:

- It was the first 150 base unit denomination banknote in the world[2].
- Approximately 750,000 notes were issued[1].
- The notes were sold above face value as a commemorative charity issue[1].
- While legal tender, these notes were unlikely to enter general circulation due to their rarity and expected higher resale value[1][2].
- The banknotes measured 153 mm x 76 mm and were made of paper[2].

In 2015, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) also issued their own 150-dollar commemorative banknote to mark their 150th anniversary[1]. However, Standard Chartered's 2009 issue remains the world's first banknote of this unusual denomination.

This innovative banknote issuance highlights Hong Kong's unique position in the global financial system and the special role that commemorative banknotes play in numismatic history and charitable fundraising.
