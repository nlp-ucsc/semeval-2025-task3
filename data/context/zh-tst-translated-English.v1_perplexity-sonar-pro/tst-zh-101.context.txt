El Al Flight 402 crashed on July 27, 1955, after being shot down by Bulgarian fighter jets. Here's a detailed account of the incident:

1. Flight path and deviation:
The flight originated in London and was en route to Tel Aviv, with scheduled stops in Vienna and Istanbul[1]. After departing from Vienna at 02:53, the Lockheed Constellation aircraft (registered as 4X-AKC) was instructed to follow the Amber 10 airway over friendly Yugoslav and Greek airspace[1]. However, the plane veered off course and entered Bulgarian airspace[1][3].

2. Entry into Bulgarian airspace:
The aircraft's entry into Western Bulgarian airspace was detected by a military observation post near the town of Tran[1]. The plane traveled approximately 200 km (120 mi) over Bulgarian territory, about 120 km (75 mi) from the Yugoslav-Bulgarian border[1].

3. Interception by Bulgarian fighters:
Two MiG-15 jets were scrambled from Dobroslavtsi airport near Sofia, piloted by Petrov and Sankiisky[1][3]. They intercepted the El Al flight at an altitude of about 5,000 meters (16,400 feet)[3].

4. Attempted warnings:
According to the Bulgarian pilots, they attempted to warn the El Al plane by firing signal rounds in front of its nose[1]. The Constellation initially seemed to comply by deploying its flaps and landing gear but then retracted them and changed course towards Greece[1].

5. Shoot-down order:
As the plane approached the Greek border, Deputy Commander in Chief of Air Defense, General Velitchko Georgiev, gave the order to shoot it down, stating: "If the plane is leaving our territory, disobeying orders, and there is no time left for more warnings, then shoot it down."[1][2]

6. Attack and crash:
The MiG-15s opened fire with machine guns and 20mm cannons[5]. The Constellation was hit, causing a loss of pressurization and a fire in the heater compartment[3]. The aircraft broke up in mid-air at an altitude of about 2,000 feet (610 m)[1][5].

7. Crash site and casualties:
The plane crashed in flames near the village of Petrich, Bulgaria, close to the Yugoslav and Greek borders[1][3]. All 58 people on board (51 passengers and 7 crew members) were killed[1][2].

8. Aftermath:
Initially, Bulgaria claimed the aircraft was brought down by anti-aircraft guns[1]. The next day, they admitted to shooting down the airliner[1]. Bulgaria expressed regret and arranged an official inquiry but did not allow Israeli investigators to participate[1]. The incident occurred during a period of high tension between the Eastern and Western Blocs[1].

The exact reason for the plane's deviation from its intended route was never conclusively established, with conflicting opinions from Israeli and Bulgarian investigators[1]. Possible explanations include navigation equipment malfunction due to thunderstorm activity, though this is disputed by Bulgarian sources[1][3].
