Adolf Galland came from a family with multiple members who served as pilots in the Luftwaffe during World War II. Specifically:

1. Adolf Galland himself was a renowned Luftwaffe fighter pilot and general, credited with 104 aerial victories[2][7].

2. Paul Galland, Adolf's younger brother, was also a Luftwaffe fighter pilot. He claimed 17 aerial victories in 107 combat missions before being shot down and killed on October 31, 1942, while flying with Jagdgeschwader 26 "Schlageter" on the Western Front[4][7].

3. Wilhelm-Ferdinand Galland, another of Adolf's younger brothers, served as a Luftwaffe pilot as well. He was credited with 55 aerial victories before being shot down and killed on August 17, 1943[2][3].

4. Fritz Galland, Adolf's older brother, also served in the Luftwaffe during World War II, though specific details about his service are not provided in the given search results[6].

In total, all four Galland brothers - Adolf, Fritz, Wilhelm-Ferdinand, and Paul - served in the Luftwaffe during World War II[4]. Among them, Adolf was the most successful and well-known, achieving the highest rank and most aerial victories. Tragically, both Paul and Wilhelm-Ferdinand were killed in action during the war.
