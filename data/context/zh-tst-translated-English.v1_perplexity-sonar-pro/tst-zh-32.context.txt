The Alemanni, a confederation of Germanic tribes, first appear in historical records in the early 3rd century CE. Here's how they are recorded in the earliest literature:

1. First mention by Cassius Dio (213 CE):
The earliest explicit mention of the Alemanni by name comes from the Roman historian Cassius Dio, who recorded the campaigns of Emperor Caracalla against them in 213 CE[1][3]. This is widely considered the first definitive historical reference to the Alemanni.

2. Possible earlier reference by Tacitus (98 CE):
Some historians argue that the Alemanni may have been mentioned earlier by Tacitus in his work "Germania" from 98 CE[1][3]. However, Tacitus refers to them as the Suebi, and the connection between the Suebi and the Alemanni is debated among scholars.

3. Ammianus Marcellinus' retrospective reference:
The 4th-century historian Ammianus Marcellinus retrospectively used the name "Alemanni" to refer to Germans on the Limes Germanicus during Trajan's governorship around 98-99 CE[5]. However, this is not considered a contemporary account.

4. Early 3rd-century emergence:
Most historians agree that the Alemanni likely emerged as a distinct group in the early 3rd century CE[5]. They are believed to have formed from various Germanic communities in the region of the Main River.

5. Etymology and self-identification:
The name "Alemanni" is thought to mean "all men" in Germanic languages, suggesting a confederation of different tribes[5]. However, Walafrid Strabo in the 9th century noted that they called themselves Suebi, while only foreigners used the term Alemanni[5].

6. Lack of earlier Roman mentions:
It's noteworthy that earlier Roman writers, including Tacitus in his detailed account of Germanic tribes, did not mention the Alemanni by name[5]. This supports the theory that they emerged as a distinct group in the early 3rd century.

7. Archaeological evidence:
While not literary, archaeological findings, including early fortifications in Germania Inferior dated to 99-100 CE, provide context for the emergence of the Alemanni[5].

In summary, while there are debates about possible earlier references, the first unambiguous literary mention of the Alemanni comes from Cassius Dio's account of Caracalla's campaigns in 213 CE. This marks their definitive entry into the historical record, though their formation as a distinct group likely occurred in the preceding decades.
