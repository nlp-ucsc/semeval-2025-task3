While it's difficult to pinpoint the very first physician to treat cerebral palsy due to the condition's historical understanding and documentation, the formal identification and study of cerebral palsy in the medical field are often attributed to **Frederick Wieck**, a Swiss physician, in the 19th century. Wieck described a condition he called "congenital spastic paralysis" in 1861, which aligns with what we now recognize as cerebral palsy. His work laid the groundwork for later research and treatments.

Before Wieck, there were likely practitioners who treated symptoms resembling cerebral palsy, but without a formal diagnosis or understanding of the condition. As medical knowledge advanced, especially in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, physicians like **Sigmund Freud** and **William John Little** also contributed to the understanding and treatment of cerebral palsy. Little, an English physician, described "cerebral palsy" in 1862 and emphasized its relationship to brain injuries or developmental issues.

So, while Frederick Wieck is often credited with the formal identification, the treatment and understanding of cerebral palsy evolved over time with contributions from multiple physicians.
