In Bruce Sterling's "Schismatrix" series, there are two primary factions: the Shapers and the Mechanics.

1. The **Shapers** are a faction focused on biological advancement and genetic engineering. They prioritize the modification and improvement of the human body through genetic manipulation, aiming for transcendence and enhancement of human capabilities.

2. The **Mechanics**, on the other hand, emphasize technological and mechanical advancements, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence, robotics, and space exploration. They seek progress through machine-based solutions and the integration of technology into human society.

These factions represent fundamentally different ideologies, with the Shapers leaning towards organic evolution and the Mechanics towards technological innovation. Their differences drive much of the conflict and exploration in the series.
