Lugdunum, which is modern-day Lyon in France, was an important city in the Roman Empire. Among the Roman emperors, Claudius is known to have been born there. Claudius, who ruled from 41 AD to 54 AD, was born on August 1, 10 BC. There might be other less prominent or usurper emperors associated with Lugdunum, but Claudius is the most notable one born in the city.
