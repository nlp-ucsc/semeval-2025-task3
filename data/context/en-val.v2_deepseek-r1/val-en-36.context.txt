As of my knowledge cutoff in July 2024, there isn't a widely recognized football club by the name of "FC Zhenis." It's possible that the club might be less well-known, newly established, or perhaps the name is misspelled or refers to a different entity. If FC Zhenis is a real club, it could be based in a specific region or country that I don't have detailed information on.

If you have more context or if the name is different, please provide additional details, and I'd be happy to help further!
