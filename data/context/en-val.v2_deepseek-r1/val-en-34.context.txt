Toruń, a city in Poland, was part of the Hanseatic League during the medieval period. The Hanseatic League was a powerful trading federation that dominated trade in Northern Europe, particularly in the Baltic region, from the 13th to the 16th century.

Toruń joined the Hanseatic League in the late 13th century, specifically in 1280. During this time, the city flourished as a significant trade center, benefiting from its strategic location on the Vistula River, which facilitated trade with other Hanseatic cities and regions. The city's membership in the League lasted until the 17th century when the League's influence began to decline.

So, Toruń was part of the Hanseatic League from approximately 1280 to the 17th century.
