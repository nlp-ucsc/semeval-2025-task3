No, not all arthropods have antennae. While many arthropods, such as insects, crustaceans, and some arachnids, possess antennae, others do not. For example, arachnids like spiders and scorpions lack antennae but have specialized sensory structures called pedipalps. Additionally, certain arthropod groups may have reduced or absent antennae depending on their evolutionary adaptations.
