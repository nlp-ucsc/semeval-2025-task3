As of my knowledge cutoff in July 2024, the Italian commune Ponzone borders the following municipalities:

1. **Cairo Montenotte**
2. **Castelnuovo di Ceva**
3. **Church of Sospella**
4. **Dego**
5. **Mallare**
6. **Mombaldone**
7. **Montezemolo**
8. **Ortovero**
9. **Roccavignale**
10. **Vaschetti**

Please note that administrative boundaries can change, and it's always a good idea to verify with a recent map or official source for the most accurate information.
