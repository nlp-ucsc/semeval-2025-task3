Yes, Kremlins and detinets share similarities in their historical roles as fortified structures in Russia and other East Slavic states. Both served as defensive strongholds, often housing government and religious buildings. They were typically located in strategic areas like town centers. However, the term "kremlin" specifically refers to major fortified complexes in prominent cities like Moscow, while "detinets" is a more general term for such structures, often in smaller towns. Over time, "kremlin" has become a metonym for the Russian government.
