There are **three main stages of labour** during childbirth:

1. **First Stage**: This stage begins when contractions start and ends when the cervix is fully dilated (10 cm). It is further divided into three phases:
   - **Latent Phase**: Early contractions, mild and irregular.
   - **Active Phase**: Contractions become stronger and more frequent; the cervix dilates more rapidly.
   - **Transition Phase**: Intense contractions; the cervix dilates to 10 cm.

2. **Second Stage**: Starts when the cervix is fully dilated and ends with the birth of the baby. It involves pushing the baby through the birth canal.

3. **Third Stage**: Occurs after the baby is born and ends with the delivery of the placenta.

Each stage has distinct characteristics and processes, ensuring a safe and successful delivery.
