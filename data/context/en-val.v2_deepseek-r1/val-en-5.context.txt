UN Sustainable Development Goal 11 focuses on making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. The goal defines a sustainable city as one that ensures all residents have access to adequate and affordable housing, safe and accessible green and public spaces, and provides opportunities for all, regardless of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, or religion. It also emphasizes resilience to disasters, addresses urban sprawl, strengthens efforts to protect and safeguard the world's cultural and natural heritage, and promotes sustainable urbanization.
