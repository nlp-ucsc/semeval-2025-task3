The White-winged Chough (*Corcorax melanoramphos*) was first described by the English naturalist John Latham in 1801. Latham was a prominent figure in the field of ornithology and described many bird species. He included the White-winged Chough in his work "Supplement to the General Synopsis of Birds," where he provided the initial scientific description of this Australian bird species.
