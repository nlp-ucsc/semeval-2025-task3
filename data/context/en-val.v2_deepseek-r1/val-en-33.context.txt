No, Chris Claremont is not the sole writer of *Days of Future Past*. The original "Days of Future Past" story was written by Chris Claremont and illustrated by John Byrne. It first appeared in *The Uncanny X-Men* #141 and #142 in 1981. Claremont wrote the story, and Byrne provided the artwork, making it a collaborative effort.

However, when it comes to the 2014 film *X-Men: Days of Future Past*, the screenplay was written by Simon Kinberg, based on the comic book story by Claremont and Byrne, as well as elements from other X-Men comics. Kinberg adapted and expanded the story for the film, incorporating characters and plotlines from various X-Men narratives. So, while Claremont and Byrne are the creators of the original comic, the movie version had a different writer.
