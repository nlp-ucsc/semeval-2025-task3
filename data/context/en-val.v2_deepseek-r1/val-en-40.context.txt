The Swedish Navy, known as the Svenska Marinen, was formally established in 1522 by King Gustav Vasa. This marked the beginning of a structured naval force for Sweden, although there were earlier naval activities in the region. The establishment of the navy was a significant step in Sweden's military development and played a crucial role in the country's history, especially during the many wars in the Baltic region.
