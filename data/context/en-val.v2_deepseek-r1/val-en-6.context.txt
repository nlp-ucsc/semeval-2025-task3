Zhejiang cuisine, also known as Zhe cuisine, is one of the eight major cuisines in Chinese cooking. It originated in Zhejiang Province, and is known for its delicate and refined flavors, emphasizing freshness, tenderness, and light seasoning. Zhejiang dishes are typically made with fresh ingredients, and have a focus on bringing out the natural flavors of the ingredients rather than overpowering them with heavy sauces or spices.

Zhejiang cuisine is often divided into four distinct styles, each originating from a different region within Zhejiang Province:

1. **Hangzhou Style (Hangzhou cuisine)**: This is the most famous and representative style of Zhejiang cuisine. Hangzhou is the capital of Zhejiang Province, and its cuisine is known for its elaborate preparation and presentation. Dishes like Dongpo Pork, West Lake Fish in Sweet and Sour Sauce, and Longjing Shrimp are iconic examples of Hangzhou-style cuisine.

2. **Shaoxing Style (Shaoxing cuisine)**: Coming from Shaoxing, a famous city in Zhejiang known for its wine, the cuisine here is known for its bold flavors. Shaoxing dishes often use alcohol in cooking, especially Shaoxing wine, which is produced locally. A well-known dish from this region is the Drunken Chicken.

3. **Ningbo Style (Ningbo cuisine)**: Originating from Ningbo, a major port city in Zhejiang, this style of cuisine is known for its use of fresh seafood. Ningbo dishes often emphasize simplicity and freshness, much like the city's proximity to the sea. A famous dish from this region is the Steamed Fish with Special Sauce.

4. **Wenzhou Style (Wenzhou cuisine)**: This style comes from Wenzhou, a city in the southern part of Zhejiang Province. Wenzhou cuisine is known for its strong and fiery flavors, often incorporating a lot of chili and garlic. It is perhaps the spiciest among the four styles, reflecting the different climate and cultural influences of the region.

These four styles of Zhejiang cuisine each have their own unique characteristics, reflecting the different cultural and geographical influences across Zhejiang Province. They all contribute to the rich culinary diversity and the fine reputation of Zhejiang cuisine in China.
