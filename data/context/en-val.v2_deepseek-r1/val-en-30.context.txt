Before the American Civil War, Valrico, Florida was known as "Long Pond." The area was named for a nearby lake, Long Lake, which was a prominent geographical feature in the region. Over time, the name shifted to Valrico, which is derived from the name of William G. Fargo, a notable figure in the area, and the latin word "ric" meaning "rich." So Valrico, which translates to "Fargo's Rich Land," eventually became the official name of the community.
