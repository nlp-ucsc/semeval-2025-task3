Yes, the Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI) is still maintained by Clarivate Analytics, which was formerly part of Thomson Reuters. It is one of the Web of Science citation databases and provides comprehensive coverage of the arts and humanities, indexing journals, books, and other sources. The index is regularly updated to include new publications and citations, making it a valuable resource for researchers in these fields.
