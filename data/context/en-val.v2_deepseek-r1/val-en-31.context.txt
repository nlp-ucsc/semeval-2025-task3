The Western Oriole (*Icterus difficilis*) is a medium-sized songbird. It measures approximately 7 to 8 inches (18 to 20 centimeters) in length, with a wingspan ranging from about 11 to 12 inches (28 to 30 centimeters). The male is typically slightly larger than the female. Despite their somewhat delicate appearance, they are robust birds with a striking yellow and black plumage, which makes them quite noticeable in their habitats.
