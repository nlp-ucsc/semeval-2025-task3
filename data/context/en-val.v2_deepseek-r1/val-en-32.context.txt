Windows Neptune was never officially released as a completed operating system by Microsoft. Development on Neptune began in the late 1990s as part of the Windows NT family, intended to be a consumer-oriented version of Windows NT 5.0 (which eventually became Windows 2000). However, the project was canceled in 1999. Elements from Neptune were later incorporated into Windows XP, which was released in 2001.
