Alright, so, today is October 14th, and I need to figure out how many days are left until the end of the year. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, I know that each month has a specific number of days. October has 31 days, so from October 14th to the end of October, there are 31 - 14 = 17 days left in October. 

Now, after October, there are still November and December. November has 30 days, and December has 31 days. So, adding those up: 17 (remaining in October) + 30 (November) + 31 (December) = 78 days. 

Wait a minute, does that include the 14th of October? I think I counted from the 14th as the starting point, so the total days remaining should be from the 14th onwards, which means the 17 days include the 14th. Hmm, actually, no, because when you subtract 14 from 31, you get the days after the 14th. So, I should include today if needed. But the question is asking for days remaining until the end of the year, so I think it's okay to exclude the 14th. 

Therefore, the total days remaining would be 17 + 30 + 31 = 78 days.
To determine the number of days remaining until the end of the year from October 14th in a non-leap year:

1. **Days left in October:**  
   October has 31 days. Subtracting the 14th, there are 31 - 14 = **17 days** left.

2. **Days in November:**  
   November has **30 days**.

3. **Days in December:**  
   December has **31 days**.

4. **Total days remaining:**  
   Adding them together:  
   17 (October) + 30 (November) + 31 (December) = **78 days**.

**Answer:** There are 78 days remaining until the end of the year.
