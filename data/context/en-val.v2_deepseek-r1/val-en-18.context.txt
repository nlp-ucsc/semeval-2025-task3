Yes, a Graphics Address Translation Table (GATT) is a form of Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU). It is specifically used to manage memory addresses for graphics processing units (GPUs) and ensure that they can access the correct regions of system memory. By translating virtual addresses used by the GPU into physical addresses in system memory, the GATT plays a crucial role in effective memory management, enhancing both performance and security.
