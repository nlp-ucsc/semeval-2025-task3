Booker T. Washington's invitation to dine at the White House with President Theodore Roosevelt on October 16, 1901 was highly significant for several reasons:

1. Unprecedented social equality: This was the first time an African American had been invited to dine at the White House as a guest[1]. It represented a level of social equality between blacks and whites that was shocking to many at the time, especially in the South.

2. Political backlash: The dinner provoked an intense and vicious backlash from Southern politicians and press[1]. Many white Southerners saw it as deeply offensive and a threat to racial segregation. Some politicians made extremely racist statements in response, demonstrating the depth of racial tensions.

3. Impact on policy: The negative reaction affected subsequent White House practices. No other African American was invited to dinner at the White House for almost 30 years after this incident[1].

4. Symbolic importance: For many African Americans, the dinner symbolized progress and recognition at the highest levels of government. It elevated Washington's status as a national leader[4].

5. Exposed racial attitudes: The varied reactions to the dinner revealed the stark differences in racial attitudes across the country. While many Northerners viewed it positively, it provoked outrage and even threats of violence in parts of the South[5].

6. Political strategy: For Roosevelt, the dinner was partly a political move to gain advice on Southern appointments and the black vote[2]. However, he seemed unprepared for the intensity of the backlash.

7. Debate within the black community: While some black leaders praised the invitation, others like W.E.B. Du Bois were more critical, viewing it as hypocritical given Washington's generally accommodationist approach to race relations[4].

8. Cultural impact: The dinner inspired artistic works, including an opera by Scott Joplin titled "A Guest of Honor"[5].

9. Historical marker: The event has become a significant marker in the history of race relations in the United States. John McCain even referenced it in his 2008 presidential concession speech as a point of comparison to highlight the progress represented by Barack Obama's election[2].

This dinner, while seemingly a simple social occasion, became a pivotal moment that highlighted the complex racial dynamics of early 20th century America and had lasting repercussions on politics and society.
