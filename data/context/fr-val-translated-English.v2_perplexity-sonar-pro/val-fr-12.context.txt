The Tobolsk Kremlin is not notorious, but rather renowned for several significant historical and architectural reasons:

1. Unique architectural landmark: The Tobolsk Kremlin is the only stone kremlin in Siberia, making it a unique architectural monument east of the Ural Mountains[1][9]. Its construction began in 1699, marking it as a significant example of late 17th-century Russian architecture[8].

2. Historical importance: Tobolsk was founded in 1587 and quickly became the capital of Siberia, with the Kremlin serving as the administrative and spiritual center of Russia's eastward expansion[2][5]. It played a crucial role in the colonization of Siberia and the development of the region.

3. Cultural significance: The Kremlin housed the first school, theater, and newspaper in Siberia, making it a cultural hub for the region[5]. It also contains important religious structures like the St. Sophia-Assumption Cathedral, built between 1683-1686[1].

4. Connection to notable figures: The Kremlin has associations with several important historical figures. For example, some Decembrist exiles settled in Tobolsk after the 1825 revolt[5]. Additionally, the last Tsar Nicholas II and his family were briefly held under house arrest in Tobolsk before being moved to Yekaterinburg[5].

5. Architectural evolution: The Kremlin's construction and development spanned several centuries, with contributions from various architects and builders, including Semyon Remezov, a notable cartographer and historian of Siberia[1].

6. Symbol of Russian expansion: As the administrative center of the Siberian Governorate from 1708, the Tobolsk Kremlin symbolized Russia's growing power and influence in Asia[5].

7. Preservation efforts: The Kremlin has been recognized as an architectural and historical monument subject to state protection since 1939, highlighting its importance to Russian cultural heritage[1][10].

Rather than being notorious, the Tobolsk Kremlin is celebrated for its historical significance, architectural uniqueness, and cultural importance in the context of Siberian and Russian history.
