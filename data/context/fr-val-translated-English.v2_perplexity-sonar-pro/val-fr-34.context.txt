Nahavand and Laodicea are closely connected, as Laodicea was the ancient Greek name for the city now known as Nahavand. Here are the key points about their connection:

1. Ancient Greek city: Laodicea was a Greek city founded in the area of modern-day Nahavand during the Seleucid period (312-63 BC)[1][9].

2. Founding: The city was reportedly founded or re-founded by the Achaemenid king Xerxes I (r. 486-465 BC), and later developed as a Greek polis during the Seleucid era[9].

3. Naming: The city was named Laodicea after Queen Laodice III, wife of the Seleucid ruler Antiochus III the Great (r. 222-187 BC)[1][9].

4. Archaeological evidence: A stone stele discovered near Nahavand in the 20th century bears an inscription from Antiochus III, dated 193 BC, establishing a dynastic cult for Queen Laodice. This find confirmed the location of ancient Laodicea at the site of Nahavand[9].

5. Temple of Laodicea: Archaeologists have been searching for the ruins of the Laodicea Temple in Nahavand, which is believed to be buried beneath the modern town[1][2][3].

6. Greek inscription: In 1943, archaeologists discovered an ancient Greek inscription in Nahavand calling on the people to obey government laws. This inscription indicated the existence of the Laodicea Temple[1][3].

7. Ongoing excavations: Archaeological teams have been conducting excavations in Nahavand to unearth more evidence of the ancient Laodicea Temple and other Seleucid-era structures[1][3][4].

8. Historical significance: The discovery of Seleucid-era artifacts and structures in Nahavand has led archaeologists to conclude that the city's history extends further back than previously thought, possibly to prehistoric times[3][8].

9. Cultural heritage: The archaeological finds related to ancient Laodicea have the potential to boost Nahavand's appeal as a destination for cultural tourism[8].

In summary, Nahavand and Laodicea are essentially the same place, with Laodicea being the ancient Hellenistic name for the city that is now known as Nahavand. The ongoing archaeological research in the area continues to uncover evidence of this important Seleucid-era settlement.
