Khobar is important for Bahrain due to its strategic location and close proximity, which facilitates economic, cultural, and social ties between the two countries:

1. Geographic proximity: Khobar is the closest major Saudi city to Bahrain, located just across the Gulf of Bahrain[5]. This proximity allows for easy travel and trade between the two countries.

2. Transportation link: The 25 km King Fahd Causeway connects Khobar directly to Bahrain, providing a crucial road link between the two countries[5][8]. This causeway enables efficient movement of people, goods, and services.

3. Economic gateway: Khobar serves as an important entry point for Bahraini goods and services into the larger Saudi market. It's part of Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province, which is a major industrial and economic hub[1][4].

4. Commercial hub: As a city known for commerce and shopping, Khobar attracts Bahraini visitors for retail and leisure activities[2]. This contributes to cross-border tourism and economic exchange.

5. Industrial connections: Khobar's proximity to Saudi Arabia's oil and petrochemical production centers like Ras Tanura, Dammam, and Al Jubail makes it strategically important for Bahrain's energy-related businesses and investments[4].

6. Cultural and social ties: The close proximity facilitates cultural exchange and social interactions between the populations of Bahrain and the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia[6].

7. Regional security: Khobar's location makes it significant in the context of regional security arrangements, which are important for Bahrain's stability and its relationship with Saudi Arabia[4].

8. Transit point: For many Bahrainis traveling to other parts of Saudi Arabia or beyond, Khobar often serves as a key transit point[3].

This close relationship and interdependence between Khobar and Bahrain is part of the broader, deep-rooted ties between Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, reflecting their long history of cooperation in economic, political, and security matters[10].
