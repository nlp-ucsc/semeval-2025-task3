This award was a significant recognition of her artistic achievements and her contributions to the cultural landscape of Algeria. The Grand Prix was awarded to her during a period when she was gaining increasing recognition for her distinctive watercolor paintings of Algerian landscapes, which had become her signature style after settling in Guelma, Algeria in the 1960s.
