Palmitoleic acid is not only of plant origin. It is found in both plant and animal sources[1][2].

Palmitoleic acid (omega-7) is a monounsaturated fatty acid that occurs naturally in both plant and animal tissues. Here are some key points about its origins:

1. Animal sources:
- Palmitoleic acid is a common constituent of human adipose tissue[2].
- It is present in all human tissues, with higher concentrations typically found in the liver[2].
- It can be found in various animal fats and marine oils[1][2].
- Breast milk contains palmitoleic acid[2].

2. Plant sources:
- Several plant-based oils are rich in palmitoleic acid[1][2].
- Macadamia oil (from Macadamia integrifolia) contains about 17% palmitoleic acid[1][2].
- Sea buckthorn oil (from Hippophae rhamnoides) is an excellent source, containing 19-29% palmitoleic acid[1][2].

3. Biosynthesis:
- In the human body, palmitoleic acid is biosynthesized from palmitic acid through the action of the enzyme Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1[2].

4. Dietary sources:
- Palmitoleic acid can be obtained from a variety of dietary sources, including both plant and animal products[1][2].
- Sardine oil is particularly rich in palmitoleic acid, containing about 15% as a component of triglycerides[2].

In summary, while palmitoleic acid is indeed found in significant quantities in certain plant oils, it is not exclusively of plant origin. It is a fatty acid that occurs naturally in both plant and animal tissues, and can be obtained from a diverse range of dietary sources.
