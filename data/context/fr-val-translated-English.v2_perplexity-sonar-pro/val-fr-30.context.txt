The Kunar River flows through two countries: Pakistan and Afghanistan[1][3].

The river originates in Pakistan, where it is known by different names:

1. In the upper part of Chitral District in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, near the Afghan border, it emerges just south of the Broghil Pass and is called the Mastuj River[1][3].

2. As it flows through the Chitral region, it is referred to as the Chitral River[3][8].

After entering Afghanistan, the river becomes known as the Kunar River[1][3]. It flows through eastern Afghanistan, specifically through:

1. Nuristan Province
2. Kunar Province
3. Nangarhar Province

The Kunar River eventually joins the Kabul River near the city of Jalalabad in Afghanistan[3][7]. After this confluence, the combined rivers flow eastward back into Pakistan[3].

Key points about the Kunar River's course:

- Total length: Approximately 480 km (300 miles)[1][8]
- Originates in: The Hindu Kush mountains[1]
- Main source: Glaciers and snow melt from the Hindu Kush[1][3]
- Flows through: Northern Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan[8]
- Major tributary: Pech River (in Afghanistan)[7]
- Joins: The Kabul River, which is a tributary of the Indus River[1][3]

The Kunar River is significant for both countries, offering potential for hydropower development and irrigation[7][8]. Its management and use have been subjects of discussion between Pakistan and Afghanistan, with recent talks about possible dam construction on the river[5][7].
