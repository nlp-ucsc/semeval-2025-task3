Thomas Paine's "The Age of Reason" was published in multiple parts over several years:

Part I was first published in 1794[1][4]. Specifically:

- It was written in 1793 and early 1794 while Paine was in France[1][4].
- The first English edition was published in London in 1794 by Barlow, selling for three pence[4].
- The first American edition was published in New York in June 1794 by John Fellows[1].

Part II was published in 1795[4][6]. Specifically:

- Paine wrote it while recovering from illness in 1795[3].
- The first edition in English was printed in Paris in September 1795 with the imprint "Printed for the Author"[3].
- A pirated edition was published in London in October 1795[4].

Part III was published much later, in 1807[4][6].

So in summary, the key publication dates were:
- Part I: 1794
- Part II: 1795  
- Part III: 1807

The work as a whole is often referred to as being published in 1794-1795, encompassing the initial publication of the first two major parts[6][9].
