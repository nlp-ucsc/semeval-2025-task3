No, the antennae of arthropods are not always branched. Arthropod antennae exhibit significant diversity in structure across different groups:

1. Uniramous antennae: Most arthropods, including insects, myriapods (centipedes and millipedes), and some crustaceans, have a single, unbranched pair of antennae[2]. This type is called uniramous, meaning it has a single branch.

2. Biramous antennae: Some crustaceans, particularly the Malacostraca (which includes crabs, lobsters, and shrimp), have biramous antennae[1][4]. This means their antennae are branched into two parts. Specifically:

   - The first pair of antennae (antennules) in these crustaceans is generally uniramous.
   - The second pair of antennae is typically biramous, consisting of two branches.

3. Segmented structure: Regardless of whether they are branched or unbranched, arthropod antennae are always made up of one or more jointed segments[2][7]. This segmented structure allows for flexibility and mobility.

4. Variations in form: Within the basic uniramous or biramous structure, there can be significant variations in form. For example:
   
   - In insects, antennae can be filiform (thread-like), clavate (club-shaped), pectinate (comb-like), plumose (feather-like), and many other forms[5].
   - Some crustaceans have highly modified antennae that may not resemble typical branched structures[1].

5. Absence of antennae: It's worth noting that some arthropods, such as chelicerates (including spiders and scorpions) and proturans, lack antennae entirely[2][4].

In summary, while some arthropods (particularly certain crustaceans) do have branched antennae, this is not a universal characteristic across all arthropod groups. The structure and form of antennae vary widely among different arthropod taxa, reflecting their diverse evolutionary histories and adaptations to different environments and lifestyles.
