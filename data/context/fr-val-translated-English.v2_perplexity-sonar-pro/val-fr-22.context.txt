Childebert IV (also known as Childebert III) became king of the Franks in 695[5][10]. He succeeded his brother Clovis IV, who had died that year[10]. Childebert IV reigned from 695 until his death in 711[4][5].

Some key details about Childebert IV's reign:

- He was the son of Theuderic III and Chrothildis (or Doda)[4].
- He was also called "the Just" (French: le Juste)[4].
- Childebert IV was born around 678-679[4].
- He died on April 23, 711 at the age of about 32-33[4][5].
- Like his predecessor, Childebert IV was largely a puppet king under the control of Pepin of Heristal, the Mayor of the Palace[10].
- He was part of the Merovingian dynasty, which ruled the Frankish kingdoms from the mid-5th century until 751[6].

So in summary, 695 CE marks the beginning of Childebert IV's reign as king of the Franks, a position he held for about 16 years until his death in 711.
