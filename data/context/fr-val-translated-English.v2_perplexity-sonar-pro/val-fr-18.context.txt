The national anthem of Portugal, "A Portuguesa," was set to music by Alfredo Keil in 1890[1][4]. Keil, a composer, wrote the melody as a patriotic protest march in response to the 1890 British Ultimatum to Portugal regarding its African colonies[1][5].

The creation of "A Portuguesa" was a collaborative effort:

1. Music: Alfredo Keil composed the melody[1][4][5].
2. Lyrics: Henrique Lopes de Mendon√ßa wrote the words to accompany Keil's music[1][4][5].

The circumstances surrounding the anthem's creation are noteworthy:

- It was composed during a period of resurgent nationalism in Portugal, sparked by the British Ultimatum[1].
- Keil wrote the melody the night after Portugal accepted the British demands, as a form of patriotic protest[1].
- The song quickly gained popularity and was disseminated widely, with thousands of copies of the sheet music distributed freely[1].

Initially, "A Portuguesa" was not the official national anthem. It was adopted as the national anthem of Portugal on October 5, 1910, following the establishment of the Portuguese Republic[1][4]. It officially replaced the previous anthem, "Hino da Carta," which had been the national anthem of the Kingdom of Portugal from 1834 to 1910[2].

It's worth noting that in 1956, due to the emergence of melodic variants, the Portuguese government created a committee to define an official version of the anthem. The current standardized version was proposed on July 16, 1957, and approved by the Council of Ministers[1][6].
