The UEFA Europa League is the successor to the UEFA Cup[1][2][5]. The UEFA Cup itself was established in 1971 and was rebranded as the UEFA Europa League in 2009[5]. 

To provide a more comprehensive history:

1. The Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (1955-1971): This was the original predecessor to the UEFA Cup. It was not officially organized by UEFA, but rather by a separate Fairs Cup Committee led by FIFA executives[4]. The tournament was initially created to promote trade fairs in European cities, with teams representing these cities rather than specific clubs[4].

2. UEFA Cup (1971-2009): In 1971, UEFA took control of the competition, discontinued the Fairs Cup, and created the UEFA Cup[4][5]. This marked the official beginning of UEFA's involvement in this second-tier European club competition.

3. UEFA Europa League (2009-present): The UEFA Cup was rebranded as the UEFA Europa League for the 2009-2010 season[2][5]. This rebranding brought changes to the format and increased the prestige of the competition.

It's worth noting that while the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup is considered the predecessor to the UEFA Cup/Europa League, UEFA does not officially recognize it as one of its club competitions[1]. Therefore, the records and statistics from the Fairs Cup are not included in the official UEFA Europa League history.
