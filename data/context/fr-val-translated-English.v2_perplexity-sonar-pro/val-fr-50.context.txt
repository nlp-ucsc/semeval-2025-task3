The capital of Farrukhabad district is Fatehgarh. Fatehgarh serves as the district headquarters and administrative center for Farrukhabad district[5][4].

Some key points about Fatehgarh and its role as the district capital:

1. Fatehgarh derives its name from an old fort located on the bank of the Ganges River[5].

2. The town of Fatehgarh is located about 5 km from Farrukhabad city[4][5].

3. Fatehgarh and Farrukhabad have grown to form a twin-city urban area, often referred to as Farrukhabad-cum-Fatehgarh[10].

4. Fatehgarh has historical significance:
   - It became the headquarters of the Governor General's Agent for the ceded provinces in 1802[4].
   - A gun carriage factory was established there in 1818[4].
   - The fort now falls within the Fatehgarh cantonment area and serves as the headquarters of the Rajput Regiment[5].

5. As the district headquarters, Fatehgarh houses important administrative offices, including the District Magistrate's office[2].

6. The district collectorate, which contains offices like the District Magistrate's office, Additional District Magistrate's office, and various other administrative departments, is located in Fatehgarh[8].

It's worth noting that while Fatehgarh is the administrative capital, Farrukhabad is often mentioned alongside it due to their proximity and shared urban area. The district itself is named Farrukhabad, which sometimes leads to confusion, but Fatehgarh remains the official district headquarters[1][5].
