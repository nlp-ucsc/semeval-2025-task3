The first Sakya Trizin was Khön Könchog Gyalpo, who established the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism in 1073 CE[1][8]. 

Khön Könchog Gyalpo (1034-1102) was a member of Tibet's noble Khön family[1]. He founded the Sakya monastery in the Tsang region of central Tibet, which became the headquarters of the Sakya order[1]. The name "Sakya" comes from the pale earth (sa-kya in Tibetan) where the monastery was built[8].

Some key points about Khön Könchog Gyalpo and the founding of the Sakya lineage:

1. He established the first Sakya Monastery, called Gorum Zimchi Karpo, in 1073 CE[8].

2. The Sakya school takes its name from this monastery and the surrounding area[8].

3. Khön Könchog Gyalpo was descended from celestial beings who had entered the human realm, giving the family the name "Celestial Race"[5].

4. The Khön family was also known as the "Family of Conquerors" for subjugating harmful spirits[5].

5. After founding the Sakya order, the family became known as "The Sakyapa Lineage"[5].

While Khön Könchog Gyalpo founded the Sakya school, it rose to prominence in the 12th and 13th centuries under the leadership of the "Five Great Sakya Masters" - his descendants who further developed and spread the Sakya teachings[8]. These five masters, starting with Sachen Kunga Nyingpo (1092-1158), are considered the primary founders and systematizers of the Sakya tradition as it is known today.
