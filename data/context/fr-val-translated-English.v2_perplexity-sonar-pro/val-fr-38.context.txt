The province of Bandundu was divided in 2015[1]. Specifically:

Bandundu was one of the former provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo that was split into smaller provinces as part of a territorial reorganization. In 2015, Bandundu was divided into three new provinces:

1. Kwango
2. Kwilu  
3. Mai-Ndombe

This division was part of a larger reform that increased the number of provinces in the Democratic Republic of Congo from 11 to 26. The change was implemented based on the 2006 constitution, which called for the creation of 26 provinces[1][2].

The process of dividing Bandundu and other large provinces was officially set in motion when President Joseph Kabila promulgated a law on March 2, 2015, determining the terms for installing the new provinces[1]. This territorial reorganization aimed to decentralize power and improve local governance in the country.
