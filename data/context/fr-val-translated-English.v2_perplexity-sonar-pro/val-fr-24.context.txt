Yes, there are several institutions and initiatives within the European Union that promote the concept of sustainable cities. One of the key programs in this area is the Urban Agenda for the EU.

The Urban Agenda for the EU is a comprehensive initiative that addresses various challenges faced by cities[3]. It works by:

1. Setting up partnerships between the European Commission, EU organizations, national governments, city authorities, and other stakeholders like non-governmental organizations.

2. Addressing a wide range of environmental, social, economic, and cultural issues in cities.

3. Focusing on improving the implementation of EU policies in urban areas.

In addition to the Urban Agenda, there are other significant EU initiatives promoting sustainable urban development:

1. European Urban Initiative: This initiative supports sustainable urban development in the EU with a budget of €450 million from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)[2]. It aims to:
   - Finance innovative actions to experiment with and develop transferable solutions to urban challenges, including green transition.
   - Improve cities' capacities in designing and implementing sustainable urban development strategies.
   - Promote knowledge sharing among urban policymakers and practitioners.

2. Partnerships for Sustainable Cities: Launched in 2018, this program mobilized €165 million to strengthen urban governance by supporting social, environmental, and economic sustainability in cities[1]. It has funded 57 city-to-city partnership projects, promoting peer-to-peer learning and exchanges of good practices between EU member states and partner countries.

3. European Green Deal: As part of this overarching initiative, the European Commission launched the Renovation Wave and the Fit for 55 package, aiming to renovate and construct more energy-efficient buildings as part of climate change mitigation actions[3].

4. New European Bauhaus: This initiative complements previous efforts through a culturally centered approach focusing on aesthetics, community, and inclusiveness in urban development[2].

5. Horizon Europe Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities: This program aims to support 100 European cities in becoming climate-neutral and smart by 2030, serving as models for other cities to follow suit by 2050[2].

These initiatives demonstrate the EU's commitment to promoting sustainable urban development through various policy instruments, funding mechanisms, and collaborative platforms. They aim to address the complex challenges of urbanization while fostering innovation, social inclusiveness, and environmental sustainability in European cities.
