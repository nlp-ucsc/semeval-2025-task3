The Red Bull Stadium in Salzburg was renovated for several key reasons:

1. Expansion of VIP and hospitality areas: The main focus of the renovation was to upgrade and expand the VIP spaces at the stadium[1]. This included replacing the previous hospitality areas, which were located in a tent, with new premium facilities. The renovations extended the capacity to 700 premium seats, an increase of 60 from the previous number[1].

2. Preparation for the 2021/22 season: The renovations were timed to be completed by August 2021, allowing the new services to be available for premium guests starting with the 2021/22 season kickoff[1].

3. Improved accessibility: The modernization included an expansion of areas for wheelchair users, adding 35 newly designed positions to the existing 65, offering better accessibility and improved views of the pitch[1].

4. Media facilities upgrade: An additional media balcony was built in the upper tier on the west side of the stadium to create more space for media representatives, especially during international games[1].

5. Technological advancements: In partnership with A1, the stadium was made 5G-ready, becoming Austria's first 5G-enabled stadium[1].

6. Pitch replacement: Despite its excellent quality, the natural turf was replaced with a new grass surface[1].

These renovations were part of a larger project to modernize and enhance the overall stadium experience for all types of visitors, from VIP guests to wheelchair users and media representatives. The club decided to bring forward this investment, which was originally planned for 2023, to take advantage of the period when spectators were not allowed in the stadium due to the COVID-19 pandemic[1].
