The Sacramento Kings moved to California in 1985. Specifically, the franchise relocated to Sacramento before the 1985-1986 NBA season[1][2]. Prior to this move, the team was known as the Kansas City Kings from 1975 to 1985[2].

This relocation marked a significant moment in the franchise's history, as it brought professional basketball to California's capital city. The move came after the team had previously been based in Rochester, Cincinnati, and Kansas City-Omaha[2]. 

Some key points about the Kings' move to Sacramento:

1. The team played its first season in Sacramento in 1985-1986[1].
2. Their initial home arena in Sacramento was ARCO Arena I, which they used from 1985 to 1988[2].
3. The move was orchestrated by the ownership group led by Gregg Lukenbill and Joe Benvenuti, who owned the team from 1985 to 1992[2].

The relocation to Sacramento proved to be a long-term solution for the franchise, as the Kings have remained in the city ever since. They've gone through several arena changes, eventually moving to their current home, the Golden 1 Center, in 2016[2].
