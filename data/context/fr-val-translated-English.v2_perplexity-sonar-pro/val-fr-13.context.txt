Johnny Cash's first film role was in the 1961 low-budget crime thriller "Five Minutes to Live," also known as "Door to Door Maniac"[1][4]. In this film, Cash played the role of Johnny Cabot, a deranged robber who terrorizes a bank vice-president's wife while his partner attempts to extort money from the bank[1][3].

Some key details about Cash's debut film role:

1. The film was produced by Flower Film Productions, with Cash's manager Bob Neal making the deal sometime in 1959[1].

2. Cash had recently moved to California and was willing to try something new in his career[1].

3. The movie was directed by Bill Karn, for whom it was his final feature film[1].

4. Cash's character, Johnny Cabot, is portrayed as a guitar-playing psychopath[1][4].

5. The film's plot revolves around a daring bank robbery timed to last exactly five minutes, with Cash's character holding the bank executive's wife hostage[1].

6. Cash performed the movie's theme song, also titled "Five Minutes to Live"[4].

While "Five Minutes to Live" marked Cash's debut in a feature film, it's worth noting that he had previously appeared on television. His first on-screen role was actually a guest appearance in a 1959 episode of the TV Western series "Wagon Train," titled "The C.L. Harding Story"[2].

Cash later expressed regret about his participation in "Five Minutes to Live," telling reporters in 1976, "Lord, I don't have any idea [why I chose to do it]. I thought everybody had forgotten about that. Please don't hold that against me."[3] Despite Cash's misgivings, the film has since become a cult classic and provides a unique opportunity to see the young Johnny Cash in a dramatic role[1].
