The historical figure most commonly associated with the legend of La Llorona is La Malinche, also known as Malintzin or Doña Marina[1][2][5]. La Malinche was an indigenous Nahua woman who served as an interpreter, advisor, and mistress to the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire in the early 16th century[8].

This association stems from several factors:

1. Historical context: Both La Llorona and La Malinche are figures from the colonial period of Mexico, a time of significant cultural and social upheaval[5].

2. Cultural symbolism: La Malinche is often viewed as a controversial figure in Mexican history, sometimes seen as a traitor to her people for her role in aiding the Spanish conquest. This complex legacy parallels the tragic and morally ambiguous nature of La Llorona's story[3].

3. Motherhood and loss: La Malinche bore Cortés a son, one of the first children of mixed Spanish and Indigenous ancestry. Some versions of the La Llorona legend involve the loss or murder of children, echoing themes of motherhood and cultural identity[3][5].

4. Indigenous and Spanish conflict: Both stories reflect the tensions between indigenous peoples and Spanish colonizers. La Llorona is often depicted as an indigenous woman who falls in love with a Spanish man, mirroring La Malinche's relationship with Cortés[1][4].

It's important to note that while this association is common, it is not universal. The legend of La Llorona has many variations and interpretations, and its origins likely predate the colonial period, with some scholars tracing elements of the story back to Aztec mythology[5][7]. The conflation of La Llorona with La Malinche represents one of the many ways the legend has evolved and been reinterpreted over time to reflect changing cultural narratives and historical understandings.
