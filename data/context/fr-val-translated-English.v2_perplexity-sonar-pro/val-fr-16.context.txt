Captain Morgan rum was created in 1944 by the Seagram Company[1][2][6]. Here are some key details about the origin and history of Captain Morgan:

The brand was founded when Seagram, a Canadian multinational company, established the Captain Morgan Rum Company in 1944[2][4]. Seagram began producing rum under the Captain Morgan name, taking advantage of the historical connection to the Caribbean associated with Sir Henry Morgan, a 17th century Welsh privateer who later became Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica[4].

Initially, the rum was produced in Jamaica:

- Seagram CEO Samuel Bronfman purchased the Long Pond distillery from the Jamaican government[1][2].
- The original Captain Morgan rum was made using a centuries-old Jamaican recipe, resulting in a dark, rich flavor profile[4].

In the 1950s, production was moved to Puerto Rico, which led to a lighter, smoother flavor compared to the original Jamaican version[4].

The brand's flagship product, Captain Morgan Original Spiced Rum, was introduced to the United States market in 1984[6]. This spiced variant quickly gained popularity and became the brand's most well-known product[4].

In 2001, the Captain Morgan brand was acquired by Diageo, a British multinational alcoholic beverages company, as part of its purchase of several Seagram assets[4][6].

Since its creation in 1944, Captain Morgan has expanded its product line to include various rum varieties and has become one of the best-selling rum brands worldwide[4][5].
