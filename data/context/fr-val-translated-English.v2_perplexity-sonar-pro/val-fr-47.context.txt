The term "molecular biology" is attributed to Warren Weaver, who was the director of the Natural Sciences section of the Rockefeller Foundation at the time. Weaver introduced this term in a 1938 report to the Rockefeller Foundation[1][4]. 

In his report, Weaver wrote:

"And gradually there is coming into being a new branch of science—molecular biology—which is beginning to uncover many secrets concerning the ultimate units of the living cell….in which delicate modern techniques are being used to investigate ever more minute details of certain life processes"[1].

This introduction of the term marked an important moment in the history of biology, as it signaled the emergence of a new field that would focus on understanding life processes at the molecular level. Weaver's use of the term reflected the growing convergence of various disciplines, including genetics, physics, and structural chemistry, in the study of biological phenomena at the molecular scale[2][4].

It's worth noting that while Weaver coined the term, the field of molecular biology itself emerged gradually through the work of many scientists in the 1930s and 1940s, gaining significant momentum in the 1950s and 1960s[2]. The term came to represent an interdisciplinary approach to studying the fundamental mechanisms of life, bridging the gap between chemistry, physics, and biology.
