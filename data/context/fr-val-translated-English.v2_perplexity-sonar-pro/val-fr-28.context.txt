The city of Esperance in Western Australia fined NASA $400 for littering after debris from the Skylab space station crashed in the area on July 12, 1979[1][2][3]. 

Skylab was NASA's first space station, launched in 1973. By 1979, the station's orbit had decayed and NASA was unable to boost it to a higher altitude or control its reentry[3]. As Skylab broke apart and reentered Earth's atmosphere, large pieces of debris scattered across the Indian Ocean and rural parts of Western Australia, including the Shire of Esperance[1][2].

Though no one was injured, the incident caused quite a stir. When NASA officials visited Esperance to inspect the damage and collect station remnants, they were presented with a $400 littering ticket in a lighthearted mock ceremony[1]. The fine was issued by a local park ranger named David Summerville as a humorous way to poke fun at the situation[2][3].

NASA never actually paid the fine, which was intended more as a joke than a serious penalty[1]. However, in 2009, a California radio DJ named Scott Barley and his listeners raised the $400 and sent it to Esperance, finally settling the three-decade-old "debt"[1][7]. For this gesture, Barley was invited to Esperance and given a key to the city[1].

The Skylab incident put Esperance on the map, becoming an international media event[3]. Today, the Esperance Museum houses a collection of Skylab debris, including a fuel tank and hatch door, as a point of local pride[3][4]. The amusing story of the littering fine has become part of the town's lore and a quirky footnote in space exploration history.
