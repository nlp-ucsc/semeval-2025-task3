Various positions can be adopted during childbirth, each offering different benefits for the laboring person and the baby. Here are some of the most common and beneficial birthing positions:

## Upright Positions

Upright positions utilize gravity to help bring the baby down and out, potentially leading to more efficient labor and delivery.

### Standing and Walking

Standing and walking during early labor can help manage pain, encourage contractions, and promote the baby's descent[4]. This position allows gravity to assist in bringing the baby down and may help progress labor[2].

### Squatting

Squatting is highly beneficial as it:
- Widens the pelvic outlet, providing more space for the baby to descend
- Opens the birth canal
- Makes pushing more efficient
- Can decrease the need for forceps or vacuum assistance[1][4]

### Supported Sitting

Sitting on a birthing ball or with support behind the back can:
- Reduce pressure on the perineum
- Provide a comfortable position for resting between contractions[2]

## Kneeling Positions

### Hands-and-Knees

This position can:
- Reduce pressure on the back
- Improve fetal positioning
- Allow the baby more space to descend
- Help relieve back pain[1][2]

### Kneeling Upright

Kneeling upright, possibly leaning on a chair or bed, can:
- Help relieve back pain
- Reduce pressure on the perineum
- Encourage optimal fetal positioning[1][2]

## Reclining Positions

While not always the most beneficial, these positions can be useful in certain situations:

### Side-Lying

Side-lying can:
- Help get oxygen to the baby
- Be used if the mother has high blood pressure
- Make it easier to relax during contractions
- Be beneficial for resting between pushes[4]

### Semi-Reclining

This position can be:
- Beneficial for resting during labor
- Useful in the later stages when pushing begins
- A good alternative if a woman is tired but doesn't want to lie down completely[2][4]

## Water Birth Positions

Laboring or giving birth in water can provide pain relief and increased mobility. Various positions can be adopted within a birthing tub, such as kneeling or squatting[2].

It's important to note that the lithotomy position (lying flat on the back) is generally not recommended as it can compress the aorta, potentially reducing blood flow to the baby and making contractions less efficient[1]. However, every birth is unique, and the best position will depend on the individual circumstances of the mother and baby.

Healthcare providers increasingly encourage women to move freely during labor and choose positions that feel most comfortable to them, as this can lead to more positive birth experiences and potentially better outcomes[1][4][5]. It's beneficial to discuss birthing position options with your healthcare provider before labor begins and to remain flexible, as different positions may work better at different stages of labor.
