Unfortunately, the search results do not provide specific information about which dubbing company was entrusted with the French adaptation of the TV series White Collar. The search results contain general information about the show and some details about international broadcasts, but they do not mention the French dubbing company responsible for the adaptation. Without more specific information, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query.
