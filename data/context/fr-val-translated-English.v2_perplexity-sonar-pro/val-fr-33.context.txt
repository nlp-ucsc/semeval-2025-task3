The Towers of Silence, also known as dakhmas, play a crucial role in traditional Zoroastrian funerary practices and beliefs. These circular structures serve several important functions:

1. Ritual disposal of the dead: Towers of Silence are used for the ritual exposure of deceased Zoroastrians to scavenging birds, primarily vultures[1][2]. This practice, known as "sky burial" or excarnation, is rooted in Zoroastrian beliefs about death and the afterlife.

2. Preserving elemental purity: Zoroastrians consider earth, water, and fire to be sacred elements[4][6]. The use of Towers of Silence allows for the disposal of corpses without contaminating these elements, as would occur through burial (earth), cremation (fire), or disposal in water.

3. Spiritual purification: Zoroastrians believe that dead bodies are quickly tainted by evil spirits[4]. The exposure of corpses to vultures in the Towers of Silence is seen as a way to purify the body and prevent the spread of spiritual contamination.

4. Cosmic cycle representation: The practice embodies the Zoroastrian understanding of life and death as part of a greater cosmic cycle, reinforcing their deep connection to the elements and nature[1].

5. Structured afterlife transition: The towers are designed with concentric circles - the outer for men, middle for women, and inner for children[1][2]. This layout reflects the Zoroastrian commitment to maintaining order and reverence in the afterlife.

6. Bone repository: At the center of each Tower of Silence is an "estudan" well, where the remaining bones are placed after the flesh has been consumed by vultures[1]. This serves as a final resting place for the deceased's remains.

7. Cultural and religious identity: The Towers of Silence represent an enduring link to ancient Zoroastrian traditions, serving as a symbol of their unique approach to death and the afterlife[1].

While the use of Towers of Silence has declined in recent decades due to urbanization, environmental concerns, and changing social norms[1][3], they remain an important part of Zoroastrian history and cultural identity. In some areas, alternative methods like solar concentrators have been implemented to maintain the spirit of the practice while addressing modern challenges[3][4].
