Based on the available search results, there is no direct evidence that Hamilton Academical Football Club participated in the Scottish County League. However, we can provide some relevant information:

Hamilton Academical Football Club was formed in late 1874 by the rector and pupils of Hamilton Academy[1][3]. The club joined the Scottish Football League in November 1897 when Renton was forced to resign[1].

The Scottish County Football League was a short-lived competition that only took place in the 1899-1900 season[5]. The search results mention that Hamilton Academical was indeed one of the member clubs of this league[5]. Specifically, the league included "Abercorn, Ayr the Champions, Raith Rovers, Hamilton Academical, Motherwell and East Stirlingshire"[5].

It's worth noting that this league was one of several supplementary football leagues created in the early days of competitive football in Scotland to increase the number of fixtures for Scottish Football League clubs[5]. The Scottish County League only lasted for one season, after which it was dissolved.

While Hamilton Academical's participation in this league is mentioned, it appears to have been a brief and relatively minor part of the club's overall history, which spans from 1874 to the present day. The club has primarily competed in various divisions of the Scottish Football League and later the Scottish Premiership throughout its existence[1][3][4].
