The Committee on Fetus and Newborn, which is part of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), has provided recommendations regarding water immersion during labor and delivery, commonly known as water birth. In their guidelines, they acknowledge that immersion in water during the first stage of labor may offer benefits such as pain relief and reduced need for analgesia, without adverse effects on the fetus. However, they express caution when it comes to underwater delivery (water birth) due to concerns about potential risks to the newborn, such as infection and respiratory issues. The committee suggests that water birth should only be considered for low-risk pregnancies and that informed consent should be obtained from the parents after discussing the potential benefits and risks. They also emphasize the need for appropriate facilities and trained personnel to ensure a safe environment if water immersion is chosen.
