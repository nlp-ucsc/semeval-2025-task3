Gillette Stadium, which is the home venue of the New England Patriots (NFL) and the New England Revolution (MLS), has been involved in several controversies over the years. One of the most notable scandals associated with the stadium is related to its naming rights and the financial dealings surrounding its construction.

In the early 2000s, there was a scandal involving the sale of naming rights to Gillette Stadium. The stadium was originally known as CMGI Field before it was renamed Gillette Stadium in 2002. The naming rights were purchased by the Gillette Company, which later merged with Procter & Gamble (P&G).

However, the main controversy stemmed from the involvement of the Kraft Group, which owns the New England Patriots and the stadium. There were allegations of improper financial dealings and exploitation of public funds for the construction of the stadium. Critics argued that the Kraft family received significant public subsidies and tax breaks for the project, despite the team's wealthy ownership.

Additionally, there were concerns about the environmental impact of the stadium's construction and its location in Foxborough, Massachusetts. Some residents and environmental groups expressed opposition to the project, citing potential disruption to local ecosystems and traffic patterns.

Another point of contention was the use of the stadium for concerts and other events beyond football games, which led to noise complaints and other disturbances for nearby residents.

Overall, while Gillette Stadium has become a prominent sports venue, its construction and naming rights were not without controversy, particularly regarding financial and environmental concerns.
