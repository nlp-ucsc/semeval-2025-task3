The typical antennae of Hymenoptera, such as bees, wasps, ants, and sawflies, are classified as "geniculate." This term refers to their bent or elbow-like shape, where the antennae have a distinct kink or bend, especially noticeable in the transition from the scape (the basal segment) to the funicle (the middle segments). This structure is one of the key morphological features used to identify insects within this order.
