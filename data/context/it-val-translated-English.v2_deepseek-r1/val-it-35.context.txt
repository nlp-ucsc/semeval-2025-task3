The logo that appears on the start page of Windows Neptune is taken from the **Windows 2000** system. Windows Neptune was a cancelled operating system project by Microsoft, intended to be a consumer-focused version of Windows NT. It was in development between 1996 and 2000 but was eventually merged into the Windows XP project. The logo from Windows 2000 was used in Neptune's early builds as a placeholder or during development.
