The term molecular biology was first coined by **Warren Weaver**, an American scientist and administrator, in 1938. Weaver, who was the director of the Natural Sciences Division at the Rockefeller Foundation at the time, used the term in a letter to describe the emerging field that focused on understanding biological phenomena at the molecular level. This new approach sought to bridge the gap between biology and the more established fields of physics and chemistry, emphasizing the study of biological molecules and their interactions.
