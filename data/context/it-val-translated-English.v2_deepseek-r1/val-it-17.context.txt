The term "kremlin" refers to a fortified complex found in some Russian cities, typically serving as the administrative and historical center. While the Kremlin in Moscow is the most famous due to its impressive walls and long history, there are smaller kremlins in other cities that do not have such prominent walls. These kremlins, though lacking the grand walls of Moscow's, still hold significant historical and cultural value. For example, cities like Nizhny Novgorod, Kazan, and Astrakhan have their own kremlins, each with unique architectural styles and historical backgrounds. These structures reflect the rich and diverse history of Russia's regional centers.
