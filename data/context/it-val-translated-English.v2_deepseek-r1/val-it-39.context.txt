The festival celebrated on the last Sunday of August in the municipality of Ponzone is the **Festa di San Gottardo**. This event honors the local patron saint, Gottardo (Gotthard), and typically includes religious ceremonies, processions, traditional food, music, and cultural activities for the community. If you're planning to attend, I recommend checking local listings for exact dates and event details. Would you like more information about Ponzone or its cultural traditions?
