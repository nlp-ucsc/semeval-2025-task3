Jef Raskin is best known for designing the Macintosh computer at Apple. However, he left Apple in 1982, before the Macintosh was released in 1984. After leaving Apple, Raskin founded Information Appliance, Inc., which aimed to create an easy-to-use computer. In 1987, he introduced the "SwyftCard," which was not a standalone computer but a card that could be added to an Apple II computer to provide a more user-friendly interface. Raskin was working on a project called the "Swyft" computer, but it never came to market. His work influenced the development of the Macintosh, but he did not release a computer in 1987.
