Legend says that the city of Lugdunum, which is modern-day Lyon in France, was founded by the gods. Specifically, it is said that the city was established by the Roman god of war, Mars, and his consort, the river goddess Lutosa. The name "Lugdunum" is believed to come from the Celtic word "Lugduno," which may be derived from the name of a Celtic god, Lugus, who was revered in the region. The Romans later associated this god with their own Mercury, thus reinforcing the divine origin of the city.

Historically, Lugdunum was an important city for the Romans, serving as a strategic center, and it played a crucial role in the development of the Roman Empire in Gaul (modern-day France). While the legend of its founding by Mars and Lutosa adds a mythological charm, the actual historical records point to its establishment as a Roman colony around 43 BCE.

So, while Mars and Lutosa are part of the mythological founding of Lugdunum, the actual historical founding was a result of Roman expansion and colonization in the region.
