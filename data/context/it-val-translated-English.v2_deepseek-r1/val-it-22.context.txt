Chris Claremont is best known for his work on the X-Men series for Marvel Comics, particularly his long run on "Uncanny X-Men." However, when it comes to Defiant Comics, Chris Claremont was involved with a series called "SABLE." Defiant Comics was a short-lived comic book publishing company in the 1990s.

"Sable" was not created by Claremont, but he did write a mini-series for Defiant titled "War Dancer," which was published in 1994. This was part of Defiant's universe and involved some of their characters. Claremont's work with Defiant was limited, and his primary association remains with Marvel's X-Men.
