Cirrostratus clouds are a type of high-level cloud, typically occurring at altitudes above 20,000 feet (6,000 meters) above sea level. They are composed of small, uniform water droplets or ice crystals, and often cover large areas of the sky, giving it a milky or hazy appearance.

Cirrostratus clouds are most commonly associated with the following cloud species:

1. **Cirrostratus nebulosus**: This is the most common form of cirrostratus clouds. It appears as a diffuse, uniform veil that often covers the entire sky and may produce halo phenomena around the sun or moon.

2. **Cirrostratus fibratus**: This variety of cirrostratus has a fibrous appearance, often appearing as tufted or streaked across the sky. It is less common than the nebulosus variety.

Cirrostratus clouds are often indicative of fair weather, but they can also be a sign of an approaching storm, particularly if they thicken and descend to lower altitudes, transitioning into altostratus or nimbostratus clouds.
