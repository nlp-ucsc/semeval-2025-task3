Alright, the user is providing information about Ghislain Konan's achievements with his national team as of 2024. They mentioned he hasn't won any international cups. I need to acknowledge this fact and perhaps offer to provide more details or context if they're interested. I should keep the tone friendly and helpful, inviting them to ask further questions if they wish. Let me phrase that in a natural way.
