That information is not accurate. The official language of the municipality of Delley-Portalban is actually French. However, it's also important to note that Swiss German is widely spoken in the region due to its cultural and geographical ties to the German-speaking part of Switzerland. The municipality, located in the canton of Fribourg, reflects the linguistic diversity of the area, with both French and German being official languages at the federal level, even though the predominant language in Delley-Portalban is French.
