According to the most accredited scientific theories, there are four fundamental forces in nature. These forces are the building blocks of all interactions in the universe, and they are:

1. **Gravitational Force**: This is the force of attraction between masses. It is the weakest of the four forces but acts over long distances. It is responsible for phenomena such as gravity on Earth and the formation of galaxies and planets.

2. **Electromagnetic Force**: This force acts between charged particles, such as protons and electrons. It is responsible for holding atoms together and for electromagnetic phenomena like light and electricity. It is much stronger than gravity but acts over shorter distances.

3. **Strong Nuclear Force**: This is the force that holds the nucleus of an atom together, binding protons and neutrons. It is the strongest of the four forces but acts over extremely short distances, on the order of nuclear dimensions.

4. **Weak Nuclear Force**: This force is responsible for certain types of radioactive decay, where atoms emit particles. It is weaker than both the electromagnetic and strong nuclear forces and also acts over very short distances.

These four forces are well-established in the Standard Model of particle physics. However, there are ongoing efforts in theoretical physics to unify these forces, with theories like string theory and quantum gravity attempting to merge them into a single, unified force.
