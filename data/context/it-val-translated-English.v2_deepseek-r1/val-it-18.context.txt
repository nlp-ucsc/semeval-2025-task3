The co-writer of *The Difference Engine* with Bruce Sterling is William Gibson. The book is an alternate history novel published in 1990. Gibson and Sterling, both notable figures in the cyberpunk genre, collaborated on this project to explore a Victorian era where Charles Babbage's mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine, was successfully built, leading to a different course of technological and societal development. 

The collaboration brought together Gibson's neon-lit, high-tech futuristic visions with Sterling's sharp, historically grounded storytelling, creating a unique and compelling narrative that blends history and speculative fiction. *The Difference Engine* is often praised for its imaginative take on an alternative 19th century and its exploration of the implications of advanced technology on society.
