As of the available knowledge cutoff in July 2024, Petra van Staveren has not won any Olympic medals. It's possible that she may have participated in a sport, but without more up-to-date information, I can't confirm any Olympic achievements. For the most accurate and recent information, I recommend checking the latest updates from reliable Olympic sources or sports news outlets.
