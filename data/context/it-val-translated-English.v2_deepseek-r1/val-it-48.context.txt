The Irrawaddy River originates in Myanmar (Burma) and flows entirely within that country. It starts at the confluence of the Mali and N'mai rivers in the far north of Myanmar and flows approximately 2,170 kilometers (1,350 miles) southwards through the country.

Here are the key states and regions the Irrawaddy River crosses or flows through in Myanmar:

1. Kachin State: The river originates in the Kachin State.

2. Sagaing Region: As it flows south, it passes through the Sagaing Region.

3. Mandalay Region: The river goes through the Mandalay Region, historically significant with cities like Mandalay.

4. Magway Region: It flows through the Magway Region.

5. Bago Region: As it continues south, it passes through the Bago Region.

6. Yangon Region: Finally, the Irrawaddy empties into the Andaman Sea in the Yangon Region, near the former capital city of Yangon.

The Irrawaddy River is vital to Myanmar, serving as a major transportation route and supporting agriculture, especially rice cultivation.
