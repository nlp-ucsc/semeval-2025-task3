The White-winged Chough (*Corcorax melanoramphos*) is native to Australia and breeds primarily during the spring and early summer months. Specifically, the breeding season typically occurs from August to December, with the peak usually in September and October. During this time, pairs form, and they construct nests, which are cup-shaped structures made of sticks and other plant material, often lined with softer substances like grasses or moss. The female lays a clutch of 2 to 4 eggs, which are incubated for about 20 days. Both parents take turns incubating the eggs and caring for the young once they hatch. The nestling period lasts around 30 days, and the juveniles may remain dependent on the parents for some time after fledging.
