A tannin funnel is a type of funnel used in oenology, which is the study and production of wine. It is specifically designed to help in the process of adding tannins to wine. Tannins are naturally occurring compounds found in plants, and in winemaking, they play a crucial role in the structure, mouthfeel, and aging potential of the wine. They can be derived from the grape skins, seeds, and stems, as well as from oak barrels used for aging.

The tannin funnel is typically used during the clarification and stabilization phase of winemaking. It is employed to add liquid tannins to the wine in a controlled manner. The funnel usually has a narrow spout or a valve that allows the winemaker to precisely measure and pour the tannin solution into the wine. This ensures that the correct amount of tannins is added without over-aerating the wine, which could lead to unintended oxidation.

Using a tannin funnel is a common practice in both red and white winemaking, although it is more often associated with red wines, which generally have higher tannin levels. Tannins help to balance the sweetness and acidity of the wine, enhance its complexity, and contribute to its overall quality and longevity.

It's important for winemakers to carefully calculate the amount of tannins to add, as excessive tannins can make the wine taste astringent or bitter. The tannin funnel serves as a useful tool in achieving the right balance and ensuring the optimal quality of the final product.
