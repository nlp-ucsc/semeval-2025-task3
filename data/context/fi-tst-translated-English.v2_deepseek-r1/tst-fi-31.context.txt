The first president of Colombia was Simón Bolívar. He served as the president of Gran Colombia, which included present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama, from 1819 to 1830. However, the modern Republic of Colombia was established later, and its first president was Rafael Núñez, who served from 1880 to 1882 and then again from 1884 to 1887. This was after the dissolution of Gran Colombia. 

It's important to note that the historical context plays a significant role in determining who is considered the 'first' president, depending on whether one is referring to Gran Colombia or the modern-day nation of Colombia.
