El Al Flight 402, which is believed to be the flight you're referring to, though it doesn't correspond to any known El Al flight number historically, strayed off course likely due to a navigational error or system malfunction. However, without specific details about the flight, such as the date and circumstances, it's challenging to provide an accurate explanation. If you have more information or context about the flight, I can offer a more detailed response based on available records and investigations.
