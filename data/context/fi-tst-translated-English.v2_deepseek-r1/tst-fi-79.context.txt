The Southern Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialoides) is a large seabird native to the Southern Ocean. Its vocalizations are generally loud and grating, often described as harsh, guttural calls. These sounds are typically used for communication, especially during breeding seasons when birds gather in colonies. The calls can vary but are usually a series of low, throaty cackles or growls, which can carry over the noise of the wind and waves. These vocalizations play a crucial role in mate attraction, territory defense, and other social interactions within the colony.
