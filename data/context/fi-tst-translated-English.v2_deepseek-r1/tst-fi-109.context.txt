The Canon EOS D70 does not exist. Canon has never produced a camera model called the "EOS D70." It's possible that you may be referring to the Nikon D70 or the Canon EOS 70D. 

- If you meant the **Nikon D70**, it features a **6.1-megapixel CCD sensor**.
- If you meant the **Canon EOS 70D**, it has a **20.2-megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor**.

Let me know if you need more details about either of these cameras!
