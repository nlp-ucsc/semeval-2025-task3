I'm sorry, but I don't have access to real-time or the latest historical sports data, including the specific medal counts for teams in events like the Olympics. For the most accurate and up-to-date information about the Cuban men's volleyball team's Olympic performance, I recommend checking the official Olympic Games website or other reliable sports history resources. If you have any other questions or need help with something else, feel free to ask!
