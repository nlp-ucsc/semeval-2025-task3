Gunnar Asplund was a renowned Swedish architect, best known for his work in the early 20th century. His most famous works include:

1. **Stockholm City Library (Stadsbiblioteket)**: Completed in 1928, this is one of Asplund's masterpieces. The library is celebrated for its minimalist design and the iconic rotunda, which has become a symbol of Stockholm.

2. **Woodland Cemetery (Skogskyrkog√•rden)**: Asplund, along with fellow architect Sigurd Lewerentz, designed this cemetery, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The cemetery is known for its harmonious integration with nature and its monumental structures like the Chapel of the Resurrection.

These works exemplify Asplund's ability to blend modernism with classical influences, creating spaces that are both functional and aesthetically powerful.
