Ethel Smyth received private lessons from several composers during her musical education. One of her notable teachers was **Heinrich von Herzogenberg**, a German composer and conductor, with whom she studied composition in Leipzig. Additionally, she had lessons from **Clara Schumann**, who was not only a renowned pianist but also a composer herself. Smyth also studied with **Ermanno Wolff-Ferrari**, an Italian composer and conductor, and later with **Mary Wurm**, an English composer and pianist, while she was in London. These mentors played significant roles in shaping her compositional style and career.
