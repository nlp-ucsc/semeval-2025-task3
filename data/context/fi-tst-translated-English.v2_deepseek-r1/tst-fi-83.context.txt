As of my knowledge cutoff in July 2024, there is no recorded significant event in Finland in 268 BCE. In fact, Finland as a country did not exist at that time. The region was inhabited by various indigenous peoples, but historical records from that period are scarce. The earliest historical records of the area date back to the Middle Ages. If you have more specific information or context, I might be able to provide further insight.
