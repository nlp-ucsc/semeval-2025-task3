The term "shared source code" typically refers to Microsoft's **Shared Source Initiative**. This initiative was launched by Microsoft to share source code with its partners, developers, and customers in a controlled manner. It allows access to the source code of certain Microsoft products and technologies under various licenses, with the goal of fostering collaboration, transparency, and innovation. The Shared Source Initiative includes programs like the Microsoft Shared Source License, which provides access to source code for specific projects. This initiative is part of Microsoft's broader efforts to engage with the developer community and promote open-source practices.
