The first warship built in Germany after World War I was the **Königsberg**, a light cruiser, laid down in 1926.

The construction adhered to the limitations set by the **Treaty of Versailles**, which restricted Germany's naval capabilities. The Königsberg was part of the **Reichsmarine**, the German navy during the Weimar Republic.

Construction began in 1926 at the **Kriegsmarinewerft** (Naval Shipyard) in Wilhelmshaven. The ship was launched on March 26, 1927, and commissioned into the Reichsmarine on April 17, 1929.

The Königsberg was the lead ship of its class, followed by two sister ships: the **Karlsruhe** and the ** Köln**. These light cruisers were designed for reconnaissance, trade protection, and fleet operations, reflecting Germany's limited naval ambitions under the Treaty of Versailles. The **Königsberg** played a significant role in the interwar period but was sunk during World War II in 1940, primarily due to British naval and airborne attacks.

In summary, the **Königsberg** holds the distinction of being the first warship constructed in Germany after World War I, marking the beginning of Germany's post-war naval reconstruction under stringent international treaty obligations.
