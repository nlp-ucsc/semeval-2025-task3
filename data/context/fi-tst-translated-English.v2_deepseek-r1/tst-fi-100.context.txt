A great question about history!

The Alemanni are first mentioned in written sources in the 3rd century AD. Specifically, the earliest known reference to them is found in the works of the Roman historian **Cassius Dio** (circa 155-235 AD). Cassius Dio mentions the Alemanni in the context of their invasions and conflicts with the Roman Empire during the reign of Emperor **Caracalla** (211-217 AD).

However, the most detailed and notable early mention of the Alemanni comes from the Roman administrator and writer **Ammianus Marcellinus** (circa 330-395 AD) in his work *Res Gestae*. Ammianus provides valuable insights into their society, culture, and military interactions with the Romans.

So, while Cassius Dio gives the first brief reference, Ammianus Marcellinus offers the earliest comprehensive account of the Alemanni. This period marked the beginning of their significant role in the late Roman Empire and the transitioning dynamics of Europe during the Migration Period.

In summary, the Alemanni first appear in written records in the 3rd century AD, with the most substantial descriptions found in the works of Cassius Dio and later, more extensively, in the writings of Ammianus Marcellinus.
