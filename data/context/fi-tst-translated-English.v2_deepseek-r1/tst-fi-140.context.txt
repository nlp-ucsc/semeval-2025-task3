The horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) produces fruit that is not typically considered edible for humans. The fruit consists of a spiny husk that encloses one or more chestnuts. While they are technically edible, they contain high levels of aesculin, a toxic compound that can cause gastrointestinal distress if consumed raw or in large quantities. Some cultures have prepared horse chestnuts as a food source after proper leaching or cooking to reduce toxicity, but this is not common. They are generally not recommended for consumption without proper preparation. Additionally, horse chestnuts are often confused with sweet chestnuts (Castanea sativa), which are edible and widely consumed.
