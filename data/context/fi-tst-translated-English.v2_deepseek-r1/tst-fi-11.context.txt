The Second Council of Nicaea was convened in 787 CE primarily to address the controversy over iconoclasm, which had been a divisive issue in the Byzantine Empire. The council affirmed the use of icons in worship as a legitimate form of veneration, thereby restoring their use in the Eastern Orthodox Church and resolving the Iconoclastic Controversy.
