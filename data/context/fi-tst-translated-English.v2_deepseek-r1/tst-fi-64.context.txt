False saber-toothed cats, also known as **false sabertooths**, belong to the subfamily **Machairodontinae** within the family Felidae. These animals were distinct from the true saber-toothed cats like *Smilodon*. Fossils of false saber-toothed cats have been found in various parts of the world, including:

1. **North America**: 
   - Fossils of genera like *Machairodus* have been discovered in places like California (e.g., the famous La Brea Tar Pits) and other southwestern regions.

2. **Europe**: 
   - Fossils have been found in countries such as France, Germany, and Spain.

3. **Asia**: 
   - Countries like China and India have yielded fossils of these animals.

4. **Africa**: 
   - Fossils have been discovered in regions that were once habitats for these large predators.

These fossils are significant in understanding the evolution and spread of big cats throughout different geological periods.
