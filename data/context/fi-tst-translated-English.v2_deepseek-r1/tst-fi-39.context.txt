The Battle of Long Island, also known as the Battle of Brooklyn, took place on August 27, 1776, during the American Revolutionary War. It was a significant defeat for the Continental Army led by General George Washington. The British forces, under the command of General William Howe and his brother Admiral Richard Howe, successfully executed a flanking maneuver that outpaced the Continental Army's defenses. This led to the British capturing New York City, which they held for the remainder of the war. Although the battle was a loss for the Americans, Washington managed to tactically retreat his troops to Manhattan, preventing complete devastation. The outcome marked a crucial moment in the war, showcasing British military strength and prompting Washington to reassess his strategies.
