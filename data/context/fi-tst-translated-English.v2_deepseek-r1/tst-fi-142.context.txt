It began after Japan's surrender on **August 15, 1945**, which marked the end of World War II, and lasted until the **Treaty of San Francisco** came into effect on **April 28, 1952**. During this time, Japan was occupied and governed by the **Allied Powers**, primarily under the leadership of the **United States**, with General **Douglas MacArthur** serving as the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP).
