Omega Centauri, also known as NGC 5139, is the largest known globular cluster in the Milky Way. It is located in the constellation Centaurus and is visible from the Southern Hemisphere. The discovery of Omega Centauri is attributed to the English astronomer Edmond Halley in 1677. Halley, who is famously known for predicting the return of the comet that bears his name, was the first to recognize Omega Centauri as a celestial object. However, it is important to note that Omega Centauri has likely been observed by indigenous cultures in the Southern Hemisphere long before Halley's discovery. The cluster's prominence in the night sky makes it a significant object in the history of astronomy, reflecting both ancient observations and modern scientific study.
