Hi! I'm not entirely sure about the dry boiling point of DOT 5.1 brake fluid. I know that DOT ratings are standards for brake fluids, and each has its own specifications. DOT 5.1 is different from DOT 4 and DOT 3, but I don't remember the exact temperatures. I think it's higher than DOT 4, which is around 230-270Â°C. Maybe DOT 5.1 is a bit lower? Or is it the same range? I should probably check a reliable source to confirm the exact boiling point to make sure I'm not confusing it with other types of brake fluids.
