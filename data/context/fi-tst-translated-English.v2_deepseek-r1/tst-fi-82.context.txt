The 2013 Iranian presidential election was held on June 14, 2013. Hassan Rouhani, a moderate cleric, won the election with 50.88% of the votes, thereby securing the presidency without the need for a runoff. Rouhani's victory was seen as a significant shift in Iranian politics, as it brought a more moderate government to power, which led to improved relations with the West, particularly in negotiations over Iran's nuclear program.
