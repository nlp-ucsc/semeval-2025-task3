24 Sussex Drive, the official residence of the Prime Minister of Canada, is a prominent example of **Canadian Victorian architecture**, specifically in the **Second Empire style**. This style is characterized by:
- Mansard roof (a steeply pitched, curved roof with dormer windows)
- Symmetrical facade
- Elaborate detailing
- Use of Second Empire motifs

The house was originally built in 1868 for **Joseph Merrill Currier** and later became the official residence of the Prime Minister in 1951. Its design reflects the architectural influences of the mid-19th century in Canada.
