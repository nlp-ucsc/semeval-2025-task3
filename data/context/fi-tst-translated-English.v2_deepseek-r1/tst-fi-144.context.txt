The **Helgoland class** and the **Nassau class** were both dreadnought battleships of the German Kaiserliche Marine, serving during the early 20th century. While they shared some similarities, there were notable differences between the two classes:

### 1. **Main Armament Layout:**
   - **Nassau Class:**  
     The Nassau-class battleships were Germany's first dreadnoughts, commissioned between 1909 and 1910. They featured a unique **hexagonal turret arrangement**, with six 11-inch (28 cm) guns in two turrets each. Each of the six turrets was twin-mounted, meaning each turret held two guns. This layout was an attempt to maximize the number of guns that could be carried and allow for cross-deck firing, where guns on one side of the ship could fire across the deck to engage targets on the opposite side.

   - **Helgoland Class:**  
     Commissioned from 1911 to 1912, the Helgoland-class battleships adopted a more conventional **twin turret arrangement** similar to British dreadnoughts. They were armed with six 12-inch (30.5 cm) guns in three twin turrets: one forward, one aft, and one in the center. This layout was more efficient in terms of space and reduced the complications of the hexagonal arrangement.

### 2. **Caliber of Guns:**
   - **Nassau Class:**  
     Equipped with 11-inch (28 cm) guns, which were slightly smaller in caliber compared to the Helgoland class. This was partly due to the constraints of the hexagonal turret layout, which made accommodating larger guns more challenging.

   - **Helgoland Class:**  
     Featured larger 12-inch (30.5 cm) guns, which improved firepower and aligned Germany more closely with the international trend of moving to larger caliber main armaments.

### 3. **Secondary Armament:**
   - **Nassau Class:**  
     The Nassau class had a mixed secondary armament of 5.9-inch (15 cm) and 3.5-inch (8.8 cm) guns. The 5.9-inch guns were useful for engaging smaller ships and torpedo boats, while the smaller 3.5-inch guns were sometimes used for anti-torpedo boat defense.

   - **Helgoland Class:**  
     The Helgoland class standardized on 5.9-inch (15 cm) guns for their secondary armament, eliminating the smaller 3.5-inch guns. This provided a more uniform secondary battery and improved medium-range firepower.

### 4. **Armor and Protection:**
   - **Nassau Class:**  
     The Nassau-class ships had slightly less armor overall, with a maximum belt thickness of about 11 inches (280 mm). Their armor layout was also more fragmented, with smaller turrets and barbettes.

   - **Helgoland Class:**  
     The Helgoland class had a more comprehensive and uniform armor scheme, with a maximum belt thickness of 12 inches (300 mm). The larger turrets and simplified turret arrangement allowed for better distribution of armor and improved protection.

### 5. **Speed and Machinery:**
   - **Nassau Class:**  
     Powered by triple-expansion steam engines, the Nassau-class ships had a top speed of about 20 knots (37 km/h). This was innovative for its time, as many early dreadnoughts had lower speeds.

   - **Helgoland Class:**  
     The Helgoland class retained the same top speed of 20 knots, but they were slightly longer and heavier, which made their speed more consistent and reliable under full load conditions.

### 6. **Service and Combat Performance:**
   - **Nassau Class:**  
     The Nassau-class battleships saw service during World War I, including the Battle of Jutland in 1916. Their unique gun layout proved somewhat problematic, as cross-deck firing led to interference between the turrets and complications in gunnery control.

   - **Helgoland Class:**  
     The Helgoland-class ships also participated in World War I, including Jutland. Their more conventional turret arrangement made them easier to handle in combat and allowed for better gunnery performance.

### 7. **Ships in Each Class:**
   - **Nassau Class:**  
     Four ships: **Nassau**, **Westfalen**, **Thüringen**, and **Helgoland**.

   - **Helgoland Class:**  
     Four ships: **Helgoland**, **Ostfriesland**, **Thüringen**, and **Oldenburg**.

### Conclusion:
The **Nassau class** represented Germany's initial foray into dreadnought design, with an experimental turret arrangement that, while innovative, had practical limitations. The **Helgoland class** refined this design by adopting more conventional turret layouts, larger guns, and improved armor, making them more effective vessels overall.
