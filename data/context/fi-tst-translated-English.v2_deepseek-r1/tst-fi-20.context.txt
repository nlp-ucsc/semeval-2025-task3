Observational cosmology is the branch of cosmology that concerns itself with the study of the universe through observations, as opposed to theoretical cosmology, which depends more on mathematical and computational models. Here are some of the key areas observational cosmologists focus on:

1. **The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB):**
   - **Focus:** The CMB is the oldest light in the universe, dating back to the Big Bang. Observational cosmologists study its temperature fluctuations to understand the early universe's structure and composition.
   - **Methods:** Satellites like COBE, WMAP, and Planck, as well as ground-based telescopes, are used to map the CMB's tiny variations, which are the seeds of today's galaxies and structures.

2. **Large-Scale Structure of the Universe:**
   - **Focus:** This involves mapping the distribution of galaxies, galaxy clusters, and other large-scale structures across the cosmos.
   - **Methods:** Surveys like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) observe these structures to infer the universe's expansion history and the nature of dark matter and dark energy.

3. **Distant Galaxies and High-Redshift Objects:**
   - **Focus:** Observing galaxies that are very far away (and thus seen as they were in the early universe) helps scientists understand how galaxies evolved over cosmic time.
   - **Methods:** Telescopes such as Hubble, JWST (James Webb Space Telescope), and large ground-based telescopes capture light from distant galaxies to study their properties and evolution.

4. **Supernovae and Cosmic Distance Ladder:**
   - **Focus:** Type Ia supernovae are used as "standard candles" to measure vast cosmic distances, which in turn help determine the expansion rate of the universe.
   - **Methods:** Observing these supernovae provides insights into dark energy and the accelerating expansion of the universe.

5. **Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO):**
   - **Focus:** BAO are regular, periodic fluctuations in the density of the visible baryonic matter of the universe. They serve as a sort of cosmic ruler to measure the expansion of the universe.
   - **Methods:** Large-scale galaxy surveys detect these patterns, which are imprinted in the distribution of galaxies.

6. **Gravitational Lensing:**
   - **Focus:** This technique uses the bending of light around massive objects (like galaxy clusters) to map the distribution of mass in the universe, including dark matter.
   - **Methods:** Observations from instruments like the Hubble Space Telescope and the Euclid mission analyze the distortion of background galaxies to study mass distribution.

7. **The Universe's Expansion History:**
   - **Focus:** Understanding how the expansion rate of the universe has changed over time is crucial for studying dark energy and the universe's ultimate fate.
   - **Methods:** By observing standard candles (like supernovae) and standard rulers (like BAO), scientists reconstruct the expansion history to infer the properties of dark energy.

8. **Primordial Gravitational Waves:**
   - **Focus:** These are ripples in spacetime from the early universe, potentially offering insights into the universe's very first instants.
   - **Methods:** Experiments like LIGO and Virgo (for higher frequency waves) and pulsar timing arrays (for lower frequency waves) are used to detect these signals.

9. **Distant Quasars and the Intergalactic Medium:**
   - **Focus:** Observing light from quasars can reveal the state of the intergalactic medium at different cosmic epochs, providing clues about reionization and the early universe.
   - **Methods:** High-resolution spectrographs analyze the absorption lines in quasar spectra to study the distribution of gas in the universe.

### Techniques in Observational Cosmology:
- **Surveys and Telescopes:** Ground-based and space-based telescopes are essential for collecting data across the electromagnetic spectrum, from visible light to radio waves and gamma rays.
- **Spectroscopy:** Analyzing the spectra of celestial objects provides information on their chemical composition, velocity, and distance.
- **Photometry:** Measuring the brightness of objects helps determine properties like distance, size, and temperature.
- **Astrometry:** Precise measurements of positions and distances of celestial objects are crucial for mapping the universe's structure.
- **Interferometry:** Combining signals from multiple telescopes enhances resolution, allowing for more detailed observations.

### Challenges:
- **Technological Limitations:** Observing very faint or distant objects often pushes the limits of current instrumentation.
- **Data Analysis:** The enormous datasets generated require sophisticated computational tools for processing and interpretation.
- **Systematic Errors:** Minimizing biases and errors in observations and data analysis is crucial for accurate conclusions.
- **Coordination:** Large-scale surveys and projects often involve international collaboration and careful planning.

Observational cosmology continuously advances our understanding of the universe's nature, composition, and history, complementing theoretical work by providing the empirical data necessary for testing and refining cosmological models.
