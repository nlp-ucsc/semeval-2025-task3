Sergei Parajanov, a renowned Soviet film director of Armenian descent, was sentenced to prison in 1973, not 1974, and the sentence was handed down in 1974. He was arrested in 1973 and charged with various offenses, including rape, homosexuality, and distributing pornography. At that time, homosexuality was illegal in the Soviet Union, and this was used as a pretext for his imprisonment. However, many believe that his unconventional behavior, artistic nonconformity, and refusal to compromise with the Soviet authorities were the real reasons behind his persecution. He was released from prison in 1978 but continued to face restrictions and surveillance until his death in 1990. His experiences are widely seen as a case of political persecution aimed at silencing a creative voice that was deemed threatening to the Soviet regime.
