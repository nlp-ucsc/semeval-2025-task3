Richard Layard, a prominent economist known for his work on happiness and behavioral economics, has expressed support for progressive income taxation. He argues that it helps in reducing inequality, which is beneficial for social cohesion and overall well-being. He emphasizes that high levels of income inequality can lead to social problems and decreased happiness, so progressive taxation is seen as a tool to mitigate these issues. Additionally, Layard supports using tax revenues to fund public services and social welfare programs, which he believes contribute to a more equitable society.
