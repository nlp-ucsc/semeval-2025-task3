The Jomsvikings were a legendary group of Viking warriors, and their brotherhood is said to have been founded by Harald Bluetooth, who was a 10th-century Danish king. He is notable for having united Denmark and played a significant role in the unification of Norway. Harald Bluetooth is also famous for his conversion to Christianity, which he promoted in his kingdoms.

However, some sources suggest that the foundation of the Jomsvikings might be attributed to another figure, such as Sigvald, a Viking chieftain, or even Sweyn Forkbeard, Harald Bluetooth's son. But the most widely accepted account points to Harald Bluetooth as the founder.

The Jomsvikings were known for their strict code of conduct, their formidable fighting skills, and their headquarters at Jomsborg, a fortress located on the Baltic coast, possibly in present-day Poland. Their exploits are recounted in several Old Norse sagas, such as "The Saga of the Jomsvikings" and "Heimskringla".

It's important to note that the historical accuracy of some of these accounts can be questionable, as they were written centuries after the events they portray. Nonetheless, Harald Bluetooth remains the traditionally recognized founder of the Jomsvikings brotherhood.
