Yes, exotic birds and reptiles are often sold in pet stores, but their availability can vary depending on location, laws, and regulations. Many pet stores specialize in exotic pets and may carry a variety of species such as parrots, cockatiels, geckos, snakes, and turtles. However, the sale of these animals is subject to local and national laws, which may restrict certain species due to conservation concerns or public safety. Additionally, some stores may require prospective buyers to obtain permits or meet specific criteria before purchasing an exotic pet. It's important for anyone interested in purchasing an exotic bird or reptile to research the legal requirements and ensure they can provide the appropriate care for the animal.
