The woman featured on the cover art of Black Sabbath's **The Eternal Idol** album is **Nicole Murray**. She was an unknown actress and model at the time. The album, released in 1987, marked a period of instability for the band, with multiple lineup changes.

Nicole Murray's involvement with Black Sabbath was limited to the album cover, and she hasn't been associated with the band since. Little is known about her personal life or career after her appearance on the album, as she seems to have stepped away from the public eye. The cover art itself is often overlooked in discussions about the band's history, likely due to the album's mixed reception and the band's internal turmoil during that era.

If you're a fan of Black Sabbath, you might enjoy diving into their earlier works, like **Paranoid** or **Master of Reality**, which are widely regarded as some of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time. Let me know if you'd like more recommendations or deeper dives into their discography!
