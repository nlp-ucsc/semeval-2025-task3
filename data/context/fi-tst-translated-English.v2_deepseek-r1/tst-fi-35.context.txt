The Anglo-Irish, also known as the Anglo-Norman aristocracy, were descendants of the Norman invaders who arrived in Ireland in the late 12th century. Over time, they became the dominant sociopolitical and economic class in Ireland, particularly after the Tudor and Stuart periods when their influence was solidified through conquest, land confiscation, and the imposition of English rule.

Prominent Anglo-Irish families included:

1. **The Fitzgeralds (Geraldines)**: One of the most powerful Anglo-Irish families, they were descendants of Maurice FitzGerald, who arrived with the Norman invasion in 1169. They played a significant role in Irish politics and were associated with the Earldom of Kildare.

2. **The Butlers (Ormondes)**: Another influential family, they were also Norman in origin. They held the Earldom of Ormond and were known for their political and military influence.

3. **The-de Burlinghams (Burkes)**: This family was prominent in Connacht and played a significant role in the history of Galway.

These families, among others, dominated Irish society, held large estates, and were key players in the governance of Ireland under British rule. Their dominance persisted well into the 18th and 19th centuries, during which time they were often associated with the Protestant Ascendancy. However, their influence began to wane in the late 19th and early 20th centuries due to land reforms and the rise of Irish nationalism leading to independence.
