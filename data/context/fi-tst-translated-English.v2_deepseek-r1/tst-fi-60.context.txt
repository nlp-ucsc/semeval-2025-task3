Maroilles is a type of French cheese that originates from the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region. It is made from cow's milk, specifically from the Friesian and Holstein breeds. The cheese has a distinctive orange-red rind, which is washed with salt and water during the aging process, giving it a strong aroma and flavor. Maroilles is typically aged for at least five weeks, during which it develops a creamy interior with a mild, slightly sweet, and earthy taste. It's often served as a table cheese or used in various dishes, including tarts and sauces.
