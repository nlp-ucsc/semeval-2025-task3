As of my last update in July 2024, Togo has not yet had a female prime minister. The positions of leadership in Togo's government have traditionally been held by men. However, it's important to note that political landscapes can change, and new appointments can occur. For the most accurate and recent information, I recommend checking current and reliable news sources.
