That's correct! The Karlsbad Decrees, enacted in 1819, were a series of reactionary measures implemented by the German Confederation, under the leadership of Prince Klemens von Metternich of Austria. These decrees were specifically aimed at suppressing liberal and nationalist movements that were gaining momentum across the German states and other parts of Europe during the early 19th century.

### Key Provisions of the Karlsbad Decrees:
1. **Censorship and Press Control**: Strict censorship was imposed to prevent the spread of liberal and nationalist ideas through newspapers, journals, and books.
2. **Dissolution of Student Organizations**: Many student groups and fraternities (Burschenschaften) were banned because they were seen as hotbeds of radical and nationalist sentiment.
3. **Surveillance and Repression**: Universities were closely monitored by the authorities, and professors suspected of liberal or nationalist leanings were dismissed or imprisoned.
4. **Centralized Control**: The decrees established a central investigative commission to monitor and suppress any activities deemed subversive or dangerous to the existing political order.

### Context and Impact:
- **Background**: The decrees were a direct response to the growing wave of liberalism and nationalism in Europe, which threatened the conservative order established by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. The assassination of the conservative playwright August von Kotzebue by a radical student in 1819 served as the immediate pretext for their enactment.
- **Effect on Liberal Movements**: The Karlsbad Decrees effectively stifled open political dissent and forced liberal and nationalist movements underground. However, they also galvanized resistance and contributed to the growing unity among liberal and nationalist groups across the German states.
- **Long-term Consequences**: Despite their repressive nature, the decrees could not fully suppress the liberal and nationalist sentiments. These movements resurfaced more strongly in the revolutions of 1848 across Europe, eventually leading to the unification of Germany in 1871 and ongoing demands for political reform.

The Karlsbad Decrees exemplify the reactionary measures taken by European powers to maintain their control and suppress movements advocating for political reform and national identity.
