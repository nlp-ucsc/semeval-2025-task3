The Garajonay National Park, located on the Canary Island of La Gomera, Spain, is named after the rebels ("garachicos") who resisted the forces of the Spanish nobleman Alonso Fern√°ndez de Lugo in 1481. The name reflects the park's historical significance and the resistance of the indigenous Guanche people.
