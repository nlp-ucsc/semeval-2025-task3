Yes, the nutcracker (Nucifraga caryocatactes) is found in Finland. It is a common bird species throughout much of the country, particularly in coniferous forests where its primary food sources, conifer seeds, are plentiful. The nutcracker is known for its distinctive call and its habit of caching seeds for later use. In Finland, it is a year-round resident, meaning it does not migrate to other regions during the winter months.
