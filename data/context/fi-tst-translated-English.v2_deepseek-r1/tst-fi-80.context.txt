The term "collage" originates from the French word "coller," which means "to glue." This art form has its roots in ancient civilizations, where various materials like paper, fabric, and natural elements were combined to create decorative and ritualistic objects. However, the modern concept of collage as an artistic technique is often attributed to the early 20th-century Cubist movement, particularly to artists like Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, who experimented with incorporating paper and other materials into their works around 1912. This innovation marked the beginning of collage as a recognized artistic medium.
