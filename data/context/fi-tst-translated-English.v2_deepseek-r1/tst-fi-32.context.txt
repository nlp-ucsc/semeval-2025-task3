As of my knowledge cutoff in July 2024, there isn't a widely recognized administrative center specifically named "West Athens." It's possible that you may be referring to Athens, the capital city of Greece, which has its administrative center in the Municipality of Athens. If you are referring to a different place or a more recent development, please provide additional context so I can assist you better.
