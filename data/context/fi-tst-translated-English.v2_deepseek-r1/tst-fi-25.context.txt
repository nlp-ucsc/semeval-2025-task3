The Aloadae, also known as the Aloadae or Aloeidae, were a pair of giant brothers in Greek mythology. Their parents were Iphimedea, a sea-goddess, and Poseidon. Iphimedea was the daughter of Triopas (a mortal king) and her mother is sometimes mentioned as Canace, though sources can vary. The Aloadae were known for their enormous size and strength, and they were said to have attempted to storm Mount Olympus by piling mountains on top of each other. They were eventually killed by Apollo as punishment for their hubris.
