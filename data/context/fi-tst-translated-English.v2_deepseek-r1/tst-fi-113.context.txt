Toward the end of World War I, Germany occupied several parts of France, including areas in the north and northeast. Mercy-le-Haut, a commune in the Meurthe-et-Moselle department of northeastern France, was indeed under German occupation during this time. The occupation lasted from 1914 until the end of the war in 1918. The region suffered significantly during the war, with widespread destruction and economic hardship as a result of the conflict. After the Allied victory, Mercy-le-Haut and other occupied territories were liberated and returned to French control.
