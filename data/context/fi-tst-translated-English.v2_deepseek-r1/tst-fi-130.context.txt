The phrase "the flower at the root of the tooth" is a bit puzzling. When thinking about a tooth, the "root" is the part that's embedded in the jawbone, and it's not typically associated with flowers. If you're thinking of a plant, perhaps you're referring to a tooth-like structure or a specific type of plant with a name that includes the word "tooth." For example, the "Toothwort" (Lathraea squamaria) is a plant that gets its name from its tooth-like roots. If you have more context or clarify what you're referring to, I can give you a more accurate answer.
