Air France Flight 296, an Airbus A320-111, is tragically known for being the first fatal crash of an A320. On June 26, 1988, the aircraft crashed into a forest near Mulhouse-Habsheim Airport in France during an air show, killing three people and injuring many others. This incident highlighted issues with the fly-by-wire flight control system, which were later addressed by Airbus.
