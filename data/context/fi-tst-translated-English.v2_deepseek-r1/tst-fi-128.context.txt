The modern pentathlon was developed by Pierre de Coubertin, a French educator and historian. He is also known as the founder of the modern Olympic Games, which were revived in 1896. Coubertin created the modern pentathlon as a multi-discipline event that would simulate the skills required of a 19th-century cavalry officer. The event was introduced at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics and has been part of the Olympic Games ever since. Interestingly, although Coubertin was a key figure in the development of the modern pentathlon, he himself was not an athlete but was passionate about physical education and the promotion of Olympism.
