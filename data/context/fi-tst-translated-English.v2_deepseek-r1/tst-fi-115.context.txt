Moshood Abiola, a Nigerian businessman and politician, won the June 12, 1993, presidential election, which was considered the freest and fairest in Nigeria's history. However, the election was annulled by the military government of General Ibrahim Babangida. The annulment was largely due to political and ethnic pressures, as well as fears of power shifting to the southwest region of Nigeria, which Abiola represented. This led to widespread protests and political unrest, ultimately resulting in General Sani Abacha seizing power. Abiola later died in 1998 while still in detention. In recognition of his victory, June 12 is now celebrated as Democracy Day in Nigeria.
