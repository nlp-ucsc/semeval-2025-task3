The creation of the first animated film is a matter of debate among historians as it depends on how one defines an "animated film." However, one of the earliest known examples of animated film is **"Humorous Phases of Funny Faces"** created by **James Stuart Blackton** in 1906. Blackton, an American filmmaker, used stop-motion and hand-drawn techniques to create the illusion of moving drawings.

Another notable early example is **"Fantasmagorie"** by French caricaturist **Émile Cohl**, released in 1908. It is often considered the first fully animated film, as it consists of 700 hand-drawn images shown in sequence. Cohl's work was a significant milestone in the development of animation.

Additionally, in 1892, **Étienne-Jules Marey**, a French scientist, experimented with animated photography, which could also be considered an early form of animation. His work involved capturing sequences of images to study motion, laying some groundwork for later innovations in animation techniques.

Thus, while there are multiple candidates depending on the criteria, **Émile Cohl** is often credited with creating the first fully animated film with "Fantasmagorie" in 1908.
