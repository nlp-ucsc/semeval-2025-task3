Nimravidae, also known as "false sabertooths," were a family of large predatory mammals that lived during the Cenozoic Era. They were most diverse and abundant from the Eocene to the Miocene epoch. The exact timeframe for Nimravidae is roughly from about 50 million years ago (Eocene) to around 20 million years ago (Miocene).
