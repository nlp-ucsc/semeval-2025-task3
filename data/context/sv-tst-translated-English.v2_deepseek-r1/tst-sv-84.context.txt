The Groninger Museum in Groningen, Netherlands underwent an expansion in the 1990s. The design of this expansion was carried out by the architectural firm **Avery Associates**, led by architect **Pritzker Prize laureate Frank O. Gehry**. This project, which opened in 1994, is one of Gehry's notable works in Europe and is celebrated for its striking, contemporary design that contrasts with the surrounding traditional architecture.
