At the Second Council of Nicaea, which took place in 787 CE, the council affirmed the veneration of holy images, or icons. This decision was a response to the Iconoclast controversy, which had divided the Eastern Roman Empire and the Church over the use of images in religious worship. The council, attended by representatives of the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church, declared that the veneration of icons was legitimate and beneficial for the faith. The council established that icons could be used in churches and homes, and that they were to be honored, though not worshipped in the same way as God. This decision restored the use of icons in the Eastern Orthodox Church and helped to bring an end to the Iconoclastic period.
