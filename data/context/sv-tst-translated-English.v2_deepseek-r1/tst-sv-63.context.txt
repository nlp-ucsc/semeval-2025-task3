Formentera is the smallest and most southerly island of the Balearic Islands, Spain. It is accessible via various transportation methods, but the most common way is by boat or ferry from the neighboring island of Ibiza. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Fly to Ibiza**: The nearest airport is Ibiza Airport (IBZ), which receives flights from major European cities and other Spanish destinations.

2. **Take a Ferry from Ibiza to Formentera**: From Ibiza Port (Puerto de Ibiza), there are regular ferry services to Formentera. The journey typically takes about 30-60 minutes, depending on the ferry type. Popular ferry operators include Balearia, Trasmapi, and Mediterranea Pitiusa.

3. **Direct Flights to Formentera**: There is a small airport on Formentera (FMT) that handles some flights, mostly from Ibiza and occasionally from mainland Spain during peak season. However, these flights are limited and not as frequent as ferry services.

4. **Yacht or Private Boat**: For those who prefer a more luxurious option, it is possible to reach Formentera by private yacht or sailing boat. The island has several marinas, including Marina de Formentera and the smaller ones in Es Caló and Sant Ferran.

Regardless of the method chosen, it's advisable to book tickets or flights in advance, especially during the peak tourist season in summer. Once on the island, renting a scooter or bike is a popular way to get around, as public transportation is limited.
