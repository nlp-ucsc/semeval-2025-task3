The American authority responsible for regulating the basic characteristics of brake fluids is the **Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA)**, which is part of the **U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)**. Specifically, the FMCSA sets standards for brake fluids under **Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 116**, which outlines the performance and safety requirements for motor vehicle brake fluids. These standards ensure that brake fluids meet minimum specifications for properties like boiling point, viscosity, and corrosion resistance, which are critical for safe braking performance in vehicles.
