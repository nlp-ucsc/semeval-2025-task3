A retronym is a term that is coined to describe something that was once considered the norm but has since become less common or outdated, often due to advancements in technology or cultural shifts. Retronyms are created to distinguish the original concept from its newer counterparts. For example, "landline phone" became a retronym after mobile phones became prevalent, and "film camera" emerged after digital cameras became popular. Retronyms help clarify and differentiate between old and new versions of a thing.
