The formation of the Alpides mountain range, which includes the Alps and other related mountain ranges such as the Carpathians, the Dinarides, and the Hellenides, primarily results from the interaction between several tectonic plates. The key players in this process are:

1. **Eurasian Plate**: This is a major tectonic plate that includes most of Europe and Asia. It plays a crucial role in the formation of mountain ranges like the Alps as other smaller plates move beneath it.

2. **African Plate**: The African Plate is moving northwards towards the Eurasian Plate. This northward movement leads to subduction (the process where one tectonic plate moves beneath another) under the Eurasian Plate, particularly in the Mediterranean region. This subduction process is a significant driver of the orogenesis (mountain-building) in the Alpides.

3. **Arabian Plate**: The Arabian Plate, which is a part of the larger African Plate, is also involved in the collision with the Eurasian Plate. This collision contributes to the uplift of mountain ranges in the region.

4. **Anatolian Plate**: The Anatolian Plate is a small tectonic plate located primarily in modern-day Turkey. It is being pushed westward as a result of the collision between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. This movement contributes to the formation of mountain ranges in the eastern part of the Alpides.

5. **Adriatic Plate (or microplate)**: The Adriatic Plate is a smaller tectonic plate located beneath the Adriatic Sea and the surrounding regions. It is moving towards the Eurasian Plate, contributing to the uplift and deformation in the Alpides, particularly in the Alps themselves.

The convergence and collision of these tectonic plates over millions of years have led to the formation of the Alpides mountain range through processes like subduction, collision, and folding. This tectonic activity continues to shape the region, resulting in ongoing mountain building and seismic activity.
