Pietro Nenni, the Italian socialist leader, returned the Stalin Peace Prize in 1956. He did this in response to the Soviet Union's suppression of the Hungarian Revolution. Nenni opposed the use of force by the USSR to quell the uprising, which led to his decision to renounce the award as a sign of protest.
