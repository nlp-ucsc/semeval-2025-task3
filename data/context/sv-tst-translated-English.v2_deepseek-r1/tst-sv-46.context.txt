As of the most recent data available to me in July 2024, the Norwegian Baptist Union, known as **Det Norske Baptistsamfunn**, consists of approximately **40-50 Baptist congregations** across Norway. These congregations are spread throughout the country, with varying sizes and levels of activity. The union is part of the Baptist World Alliance and works on promoting Baptist values and missions both locally and globally. For the most up-to-date numbers, it's best to check directly with the Norwegian Baptist Union or their official website.
