John Christopher Willis (1921-1988) was a British botanist known for his work on the taxonomy of flowering plants, particularly in the family Acanthaceae. He worked at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in Richmond, London, England, for much of his career, where he was the Deputy Keeper of the Herbarium. 

Willis spent his professional life primarily in the United Kingdom, with the majority of his time dedicated to botanical research and classification at Kew Gardens. He also engaged in various botanical expeditions and collaborations, but his main residence and workplace remained in England.
