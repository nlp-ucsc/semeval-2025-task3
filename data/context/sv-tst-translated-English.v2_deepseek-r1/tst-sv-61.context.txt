A vocal cord polyp is a non-cancerous growth that occurs on the vocal cords, which are located in the larynx (voice box). These growths can affect speech, cause hoarseness or loss of voice, and may lead to breathing difficulties in severe cases. Polyps typically develop due to prolonged irritation or strain on the vocal cords, such as from smoking, excessive talking or singing, shouting, or acid reflux (GERD).

When it comes to treatment, the first step usually involves addressing the underlying cause of the polyp. This may include lifestyle changes like quitting smoking, reducing vocal strain, or managing reflux through dietary adjustments and medications. If these measures are not sufficient, a doctor may recommend surgery to remove the polyp. Surgery is usually performed under general anesthesia and involves using specialized tools to carefully remove the polyp while preserving the surrounding healthy tissue. In some cases, voice therapy sessions with a speech therapist may be suggested after surgery to help restore proper vocal cord function and prevent recurrence.

It's important to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan, as untreated vocal cord polyps can lead to chronic voice issues and other complications.
