In Korea, the harvest festival is known as **Chuseok**. It is celebrated on the 15th day of the 8th lunar month in the traditional lunar calendar, which typically falls in late September or early October in the Gregorian calendar. Chuseok is a major holiday where families come together to honor their ancestors, share traditional foods like **songpyeon** (half-moon shaped rice cakes), and celebrate the harvest season.
