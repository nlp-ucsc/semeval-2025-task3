HD 123569 is a star located in the constellation of Centaurus. It’s a young star, only about 10-20 million years old, which is quite young compared to our Sun, which is about 4.5 billion years old. It’s also a bit larger and more massive than the Sun. If you’re interested in observing it, Centaurus is a southern constellation, so it’s best visible from the southern hemisphere.
