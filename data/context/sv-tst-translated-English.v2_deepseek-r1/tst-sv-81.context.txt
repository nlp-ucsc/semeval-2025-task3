The term "Danish Golden Age" (Den danske Guldalder) was first used in the mid-19th century to describe a period of cultural and scientific flourishing in Denmark that occurred approximately between 1800 and 1850. This era saw significant contributions in literature, art, architecture, and science, with notable figures such as Hans Christian Andersen, SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard, and Bertel Thorvaldsen making lasting impacts. The term gained popularity as a way to celebrate the cultural achievements of the time and to highlight Denmark's role during this period of relative peace and prosperity.
