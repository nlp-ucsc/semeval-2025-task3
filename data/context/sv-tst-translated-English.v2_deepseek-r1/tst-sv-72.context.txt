A blind arcade is an architectural feature that consists of a series of arches separated by columns or piers, but unlike a regular arcade, the arches do not form an open passageway. Instead, they are often decorative and applied to a solid wall, creating a visually appealing design without serving a structural purpose as a load-bearing element.

Blind arcades were commonly used in Romanesque and Gothic architecture to add visual interest and rhythm to large, plain walls. They could also be used to create a sense of depth or to frame windows and doors. The arches in a blind arcade are typically uniform in design, which helps to create a harmonious and balanced appearance.

In some cases, the blind arcade might be used to symbolize something beyond the physical structure, such as the unity and harmony of a religious community in the case of churches and monasteries.

Overall, the blind arcade is a versatile and aesthetically pleasing architectural element that has been used throughout history to enhance the beauty and design of buildings.
