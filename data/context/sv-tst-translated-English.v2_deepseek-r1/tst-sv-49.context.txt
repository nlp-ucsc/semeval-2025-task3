The Battle of Long Island, which took place on August 27, 1776, was won by the British forces under the command of General William Howe and General Charles Cornwallis. This battle was a significant defeat for the Continental Army led by General George Washington. The British victory allowed them to occupy New York City, which remained under British control until the end of the American Revolutionary War in 1783.
