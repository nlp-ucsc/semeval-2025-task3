The age limit for a computer game, such as **F.E.A.R.**, is typically determined by the **ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board)** rating. 

- **F.E.A.R.** has been rated **M for Mature** by the ESRB.
- This rating suggests that the game is suitable for players **17 years old and older**.
- The M rating is due to content such as **intense violence**, **blood and gore**, and **strong language**.

It's always a good idea for parents or guardians to review the game's content to decide if it's appropriate for younger players.
