Omega Centauri is the brightest globular cluster in the night sky and is visible to the naked eye under clear conditions. It's the largest globular cluster in the Milky Way, containing millions of stars. Unlike other globular clusters, Omega Centauri has a higher metallicity, suggesting it might be the remains of a dwarf galaxy. Additionally, it contains a supermassive black hole, which is unusual for a globular cluster.
