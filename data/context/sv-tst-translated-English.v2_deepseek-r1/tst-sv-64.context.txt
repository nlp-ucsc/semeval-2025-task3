I see that you're asking about the number of stamens in flowers from the "Our Father" family. I'm not familiar with a plant family by that specific name. It's possible there might be a translation issue or a less common term being used here.

If you meant a specific plant or a different family, could you provide more details or clarify the name? That way, I can give you a more accurate answer. For example, if you're referring to a particular type of flower or plant, let me know and I'll do my best to help!
