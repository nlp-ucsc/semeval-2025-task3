Geoffroi de Villehardouin, a French knight and historian, is best known for his participation in the Fourth Crusade (1202â€“1204). He was a key figure in this crusade, which ultimately led to the sack of Constantinople in 1204. Villehardouin served as a leader and negotiator during the crusade and later became Marshal of the Latin Empire, which was established in the aftermath of the conquest.

Villehardouin wrote an account of the Fourth Crusade, *The Conquest of Constantinople*, which is one of the most important primary sources for understanding the events of this period.

He is not known to have participated in any other major Crusades besides the Fourth Crusade.
