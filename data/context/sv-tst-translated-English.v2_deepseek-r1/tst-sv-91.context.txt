The Persian King Bahram I is traditionally believed to have reigned in the 3rd century AD. Specifically, his reign is usually dated to around 271-274 AD. Bahram I was a Sassanian king, ruling during a period when the Sassanian Empire was a major power in the region. He succeeded his father, Shapur I, who had expanded the empire significantly. Bahram I's reign was relatively short and is not as well-documented as that of his father. He was succeeded by Bahram II.
