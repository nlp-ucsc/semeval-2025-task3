Theano (Greek: Θέανος) was an ancient Greek philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer who lived in Croton, Magna Graecia (now in southern Italy). She is most notable for being the wife of Pythagoras, the renowned Greek philosopher and founder of Pythagoreanism. 

Little is known about her life with certainty, but it is believed that Theano was born around 570 BCE. She is thought to have worked closely with her husband and possibly even continued his work after his death. While there are accounts of her involvement in philosophical and mathematical endeavors, much of the information about her is speculative and comes from secondary sources, as few direct works by her survive to the present day.

In summary, Theano is estimated to have lived in the mid-6th to early 5th century BCE.
