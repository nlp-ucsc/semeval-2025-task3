I'm sorry, but I don't have information about a person named Kayle Browning winning an Olympic silver medal. It's possible that this event occurred after my training data was last updated in July 2024, or perhaps I don't have the specific details on this topic. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking the latest Olympic records or reliable news sources.
