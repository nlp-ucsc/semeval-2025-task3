Gelon, the tyrant of Gela, became the ruler of Syracuse around 491 BCE. He was invited by the Syracusan aristocrats to intervene in a conflict between them and the democratic forces in the city. After taking control, Gelon not only ruled Syracuse but also extended his influence across much of Sicily, establishing a powerful tyranny. His reign marked a significant period in Sicilian history, known for both its political dominance and cultural achievements.
