The French troops occupied the Albanian Republic of Korça in 1916, during World War I. This occupation was part of a broader effort by the Allied Powers to counterbalance the influence of other armies in the region. The Republic of Korça was a short-lived, self-declared entity established in southern Albania in December 1916, and it existed until the end of the war in 1918. The French presence in the area was aimed at stabilizing the region and preventing it from falling under enemy control.
