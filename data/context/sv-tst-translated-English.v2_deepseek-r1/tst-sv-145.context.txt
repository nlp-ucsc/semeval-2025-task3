Sweyn Forkbeard and Harald Bluetooth were both significant figures in Viking Age Scandinavia, known for their roles in shaping the history of Denmark and England. While they were both associated with Christianity to some extent, the exact dates of their baptisms are not well-documented in historical records.

Harald Bluetooth, who ruled Denmark and Norway in the late 10th century, is known for his conversion to Christianity. According to the Jelling Stones, which he erected, he claimed to have made the Danes Christian. However, the exact date of his baptism is not certain. It is believed to have occurred around the mid to late 10th century, possibly around 965-985.

Sweyn Forkbeard, on the other hand, was the son of Harald Bluetooth and went on to become King of Denmark and England. His relationship with Christianity was complicated; while he led invasions of England and was known for his raids, there are accounts suggesting he was baptized. The exact date of his baptism is not clear, but it is thought to have taken place in the late 10th or early 11th century, possibly around 986 or later.

In summary, while both rulers were associated with the adoption of Christianity, the precise dates of their baptisms remain uncertain due to the lack of detailed historical records from that period.
