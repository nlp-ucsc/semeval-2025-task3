The name "Chaos" for the object 19521 Chaos in the Kuiper Belt refers to the concept of chaos in mythology and science. In mythology, Chaos was the first deity and the void from which all other deities and the universe emerged. In a scientific context, chaos theory studies complex and unpredictable systems. The name reflects the object's role as one of the early known bodies in the Kuiper Belt, a region of many small icy bodies beyond Neptune, and the complex, unpredictable nature of orbital dynamics in that region.
