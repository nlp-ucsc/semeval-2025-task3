Gergely Kulcsár is not a widely recognized name in major international sports, and I couldn't find any information about an Olympic medalist by that name. It's possible that you may be referring to a less well-known athlete or there might be a mistake in the name.

If you have more context or details, I'd be happy to help further. If Gergely Kulcsár is indeed an Olympic medalist, he might compete in a sport that isn't as widely covered in mainstream media, or perhaps it's a name that's not commonly associated with major international competitions. Let me know if you'd like me to look into this further!
