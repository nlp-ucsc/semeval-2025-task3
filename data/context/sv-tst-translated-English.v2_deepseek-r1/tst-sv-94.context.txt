The alliance between Sparta, Athens, and Ptolemy II of Egypt was created in 267 BCE, led by the Athenian statesman and general Chremonides. This alliance was formed during the Chremonidean War, which arose from the conflict between Athens and Sparta against the Macedonian Empire under Antigonus II Gonatas. Ptolemy II provided naval support to Athens and Sparta in an effort to counterbalance Macedonian power in Greece. However, the war concluded unfavorably for the allies with the defeat at the Battle of Corinth in 261 BCE.
