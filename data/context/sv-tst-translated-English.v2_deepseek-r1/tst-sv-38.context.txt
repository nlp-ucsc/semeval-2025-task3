According to publicly available information, the JL-2 has a payload capacity that allows it to carry a single nuclear warhead, although some reports suggest it might have the capability to carry multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs). However, the exact details regarding the specifics of its payload, such as the number of warheads and their yield, are not publicly disclosed. For more detailed and accurate information, consulting official Chinese military publications or authoritative defense analyses would be necessary.
