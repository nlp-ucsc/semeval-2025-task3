I don't have the specific information on the size of asteroid 8903 Paulcruikshank. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking a reliable source or database that specializes in astronomical data, such as NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory or the Minor Planet Center. These sources regularly update their information and can provide detailed specifications about various celestial bodies.
