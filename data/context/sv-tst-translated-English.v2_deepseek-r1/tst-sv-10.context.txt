As of my last update in July 2024, I don't have real-time data or specific rainfall statistics for Kabupaten Tapin. However, I can suggest ways for you to find this information:

1. **Local Weather Services**: Check the Indonesian Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency (BMKG) website. They provide detailed climate and rainfall data for regions across Indonesia.

2. **Global Meteorological Databases**: Websites like World Weather Online or historical climate databases might have the rainfall data you're looking for.

3. **Research Studies**: Academic papers or regional climate assessments might include rainfall patterns for Kabupaten Tapin.

If you need more specific guidance or help accessing these resources, feel free to ask!
