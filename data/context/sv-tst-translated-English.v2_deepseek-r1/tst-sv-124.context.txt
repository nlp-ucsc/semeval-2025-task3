International Klein Blue, also known as IKB, was created by the French artist Yves Klein in the 1950s. He developed this unique shade of blue, which became a hallmark of his work, and patented it under the name "International Klein Blue" in 1960. The patent was registered as a shade of paint that had a specific chemical composition, consisting of ultramarine pigment in a synthetic medium. This innovative approach allowed Klein to have full control over the production of his art, ensuring that the color remained consistent and as he envisioned it. His patent was a significant step in the art world, as it marked one of the first times an artist had legally protected their own color, demonstrating Klein's meticulous attention to detail and his commitment to preserving the integrity of his artistic vision.
