Steelville, Missouri, got its name from a combination of the surname "Steel" and the suffix "-ville," which was a common practice in naming towns during the 19th century. The town was named after John Steel, who was an early settler and a prominent resident in the area. Steel was involved in local business and played a significant role in the community's development during its early years. The addition of "-ville" was meant to denote a small village or town, which was typical in the naming conventions of many settlements during that era.
