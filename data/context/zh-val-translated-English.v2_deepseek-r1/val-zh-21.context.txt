In Chinese, the term "rhetoric" is translated as "修辞性" (xiū shen xìng). Let's break down the characters:

1. "修" (xiū) means "to decorate," "to embellish," or "to cultivate."
2. "辞" (cí) refers to "words," "language," or "speech."
3. "性" (xìng) means "nature" or "character."

So, "修辞性" can be literally translated as "the nature of decorating language." It reflects the aspect of rhetoric that deals with the artistry and skillful use of language to persuade or impress.
