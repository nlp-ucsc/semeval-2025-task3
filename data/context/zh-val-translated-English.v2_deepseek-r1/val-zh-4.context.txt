Galicia is an autonomous community located in the northwest of Spain, bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Cantabrian Sea to the north, the Principality of Asturias to the east, and the provinces of León and Zamora (part of Castile and León) to the southeast and south, respectively. Its geographical and climate characteristics are distinct and varied:

**Geographical Characteristics:**

1. **Mountainous Terrain**: Galicia's landscape is dominated by mountains and hills. The region is part of the Galician-Minhense mountain range, which includes the Serra dos Ancares, Monte Faro, and other peaks. These mountains create a fragmented landscape with deep valleys and gorges.

2. **Coastline**: Galicia has an extensive and rugged coastline along the Atlantic Ocean, known for its beauty and dramatic cliffs. The coastline features numerous fjord-like inlets called "Rías," which are popular for their natural beauty and tourism. The Rías Baixas and Rías Altas are the most notable.

3. **Hydrography**: The region is rich in rivers, including the Miño, Sil, and Tambre rivers. The Miño River forms part of the border with Portugal and is the longest river entirely within Galicia. These rivers contribute to the region's lush landscapes and support agriculture and hydroelectric power.

4. **Lakes and Wetlands**: Galicia has several natural and artificial lakes, as well as wetlands and estuaries that are important for biodiversity, especially for migratory birds.

**Climate Characteristics:**

1. **Oceanic Climate**: Galicia experiences a humid oceanic climate (Cfb), characterized by mild temperatures, frequent rainfall, and high humidity throughout the year. This climate is influenced by the Atlantic Ocean, which moderates temperatures and brings consistent moisture.

2. **Rainfall**: Galicia is one of the rainiest regions in Spain. Annual rainfall ranges between 800 mm and 2,000 mm, with the highest levels in the mountainous areas. Rainfall is frequent but rarely torrential, contributing to the region's lush green landscapes.

3. **Temperatures**: Winters are mild, with average temperatures around 8-12°C (46-54°F), while summers are cool to mild, with average high temperatures between 20-25°C (68-77°F). This moderate temperature range supports the growth of various crops.

4. **Wind**: The region experiences significant wind, particularly along the coast, where Atlantic storms bring strong winds and rough seas, especially during the winter months.

5. **Fog**: Fog is common in the interior and mountainous areas, especially during the winter, adding to the region's mystical and humid environment.

**Conclusion:**

Galicia's unique combination of mountainous terrain, extensive coastline, and oceanic climate creates a lush, green landscape with significant biodiversity. These geographical and climate characteristics support a variety of ecosystems, from dense forests to coastal wetlands, and contribute to the region's rich natural beauty and cultural heritage.
