The Moscow Kremlin, a fortified complex in the heart of Moscow, Russia, has a recorded history dating back to the 12th century. It began as a wooden fortress strategically located on a hill overlooking the Moskva River, serving as the seat of power for the Duchy of Moscow. Over the centuries, the Kremlin has been destroyed and rebuilt multiple times, evolving through various architectural styles and political eras. It has served as the residence of tsars, the seat of the Soviet government, and now houses the President of Russia, while also being a UNESCO World Heritage site.
