The Swedish Navy, officially known as the *Marinen*, is the naval branch of the Swedish Armed Forces (*Försvarsmakten*). It is responsible for naval operations and defending Sweden's coastal and maritime interests. The components of the Swedish Navy are organized to perform a variety of tasks, including littoral defense, minesweeping, submarine operations, and international peacekeeping missions. Below are the main components:

1. **Surface Fleet (Ytstridsflottiljen):**
   - **Corvettes (Korvetter):** Main combatants of the Swedish Navy, designed for coastal defense and multi-role operations. Notable classes include the *Göteborg*-class and *Visby*-class corvettes.
   - **Patrol Boats (Patrullbåtar):** Used for coastal patrol, surveillance, and interdiction. Examples include the *Stridsbåt 90*-class and *Tapper*-class.
   - **Amphibious Ships (Amfibiefartyg):** The *boat squadron* (Båtskvadronen) includes amphibious assault ships like the *SOEunikum*Lbltn or landing craft for troop and vehicle transport.

2. **Submarine Force (Ubåtsflottiljen):**
   - **Submarines (Ubåtar):** Sweden operates conventional submarines, with the *Gotland*-class and *Blekinge*-class being the most advanced. Submarines are crucial for coastal defense and reconnaissance.
   - **Submarine Rescue Units:** Specialized units designed for rescuing crews from distressed submarines.

3. **Mine Warfare Command (Minkrigsflottiljen):**
   - **Minesweepers (Minsvepare):** Ships and boats designed to detect and clear naval mines. The *Koster*-class and *Strom*-class are examples.
   - **Minehunters (Minröjare):** More advanced vessels equipped with sonar and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) to locate and dispose of mines.

4. **Marine Infantry (Amfibiekåren):**
   - **Amphibious Brigades (Amfibiebrigaden):** The 1st Marine Brigade (*Amfibiebrigaden, Amf 1*) is specialized in amphibious assaults, beach landing operations, and littoral warfare. The * marinetraindon* (Marine Rifle Battalion) conducts ground combat operations.

5. **Naval Aviation (Marinens Flygdivision):**
   - **Helicopter Units (Helikopterenheter):** The Navy operates helicopters like the *NHIndustries NH90* and *AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat* for surveillance, anti-submarine warfare (ASW), and transport missions.

6. **Naval Bases and Commands (Flottbaser och Kommandon):**
   - **Naval Bases (Flottbaser):** Key bases include the Karlskrona naval base (*MarinBassen*) and the Muskö naval base (*MarinBassκαιn*), which serve as hubs for operations and logistics.
   - **Command and Control (Ledning och Styrning):** The navy has a command structure that coordinates operations, training, and readiness.

7. **Education and Training (Utbildning och Träning):**
   - **Naval Academy (Marinens Officershögskola):** Located in Karlskrona, it provides officer training and education for future naval leaders.
   - **Specialized Training Units:** Centers for training in submarine operations, mine countermeasures, and amphibious warfare.

8. **Reserve and Mobilization Units (Reserv och Mobiliseringsenheter):**
   - **Reserve Flotillas (Reservflottiljer):** These units consist of reservists who can be mobilized during emergencies or conflicts to reinforce active-duty units.
   - **Mobilization Ships (Mobiliseringfartyg):** Some ships are maintained in reserve and can be quickly activated for operational needs.

9. **Support and Auxiliary Vessels (Stöd och Hjälpfartyg):**
   - **Replenishment Ships (E Alvarez):** Vessels like the *K Salisbury*class provide logistical support, including fuel, ammunition, and provisions, to ships at sea.
   - **Tugs and Salvage Ships (Bogserbåtar och Bergningsfartyg):** These vessels assist in towing, salvage operations, and environmental response.

10. **Intelligence and Surveillance (Underrättelser och Spaning):**
    - **Signals Intelligence (SIGNIT):** The navy conducts signals intelligence to monitor and analyze communications and electronic emissions.
    - **Imagery Intelligence (IMINT):** Satellites and reconnaissance aircraft provide imagery for surveillance and target acquisition.
    - **Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT):** Technical intelligence gathered from sensors and radar systems.

11. **Coastal Defense and Shore-Based Systems (Kustförsvar och Landbaserade System):**
    - **Coastal Artillery (Kustartilleri):** Although reduced in recent years, remaining coastal defense systems include anti-ship missiles and radar installations.
    - **Shore-Based Missile Systems:** Some coastal defense units are equipped with surface-to-ship missiles for defending key harbors and littoral areas.

12. **International Contributions (Internationella Insatser):**
    - **UN and NATO Missions:** Sweden participates in international peacekeeping missions, often contributing naval assets to operations under UN or NATO auspices.

13. **Research and Development (Forskning och Utveckling):**
    - **Naval Technology Centers (Marintekniska Centrum):** The navy collaborates with research institutions and defense companies to develop advanced technologies for future naval capabilities, such as unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and stealth technology.

These components work together to ensure that the Swedish Navy can effectively defend the country's territorial waters, participate in international missions, and maintain readiness for a variety of maritime challenges.
