Diplomatic missions and representatives are typically classified into several categories based on their functions, levels of representation, and the agreements between countries. Below is an overview of the primary classifications:

---

### **1. Types of Diplomatic Missions**
Diplomatic missions refer to the official representatives and establishments that a sovereign state maintains in the territory of another state to carry out diplomatic relations. These are the main types:

1. **Embassy**:
   - The highest-ranking diplomatic mission, typically headed by an Ambassador.
   - Represents the sending state at the highest level and is usually located in the capital city of the host country.
   - Handles a wide range of diplomatic, political, economic, and consular affairs.

2. **High Commission**:
   - Used by Commonwealth nations to denote their diplomatic missions in other Commonwealth countries.
   - Functionally equivalent to an embassy but reflects the historical ties between Commonwealth member states.

3. **Consulate/Consulate-General**:
   - Represents the sending state in a specific region of the host country, often in major cities or ports.
   - Handles consular affairs such as assisting citizens, issuing visas, and providing trade and economic support.
   - May also act as a junior diplomatic mission in the absence of an embassy.

4. **Legation** (Historical):
   - A lower-ranking mission than an embassy, typically headed by a Minister or Counselor.
   - This term is largely outdated and has been replaced by embassies in modern diplomacy.

5. **Mission**:
   - A general term for any diplomatic outpost, often used by international organizations or in specific contexts (e.g., "Special Mission").

   - Ambassadors are typically posted to capitals and are the official representatives to the host government.

   - Exercises the same functions as an Ambassador but reflects the special relationship between member states.

3. **Minister**:
   - A diplomatic rank below Ambassador.
   - May lead a legation or act as a deputy to the Ambassador.

4. **Chargé d'Affaires**:
   - Acts as the temporary head of a diplomatic mission in the absence of an Ambassador or when relations are at a lower level.
   - May be ad interim (temporary) or en pied (permanently in charge of limited relations).

5. **Consul/Consul-General**:
   - Responsible for consular affairs such as protecting citizens, issuing travel documents, and promoting trade.
   - May also represent the sending state in a specific region or city.

6. **Attaché**:
