Pasteur Crater is a large lunar impact crater located on the Moon's surface. Here are some of its key physical characteristics:

1. **Size**: Pasteur Crater has a diameter of approximately 113 kilometers (70 miles), making it a significant feature on the lunar surface.

2. **Location**: It is situated in the southwestern part of the Moon's near side, in the Mare Australe region.

3. **Depth**: The crater has a depth of about 3.6 kilometers (2.2 miles), which is relatively deep compared to other similar-sized craters.

4. **Rim**: The rim of Pasteur Crater is well-defined and raised above the surrounding terrain. It shows signs of erosion, which is typical for many lunar craters over time due to meteorite impacts and other geological processes.

5. **Ejecta**: The crater is surrounded by a notable ejecta blanket, which is the debris thrown out during the impact event. This ejecta is spread out radially from the crater and can be seen as a brighter, more uneven surface compared to the surrounding areas.

6. **Floor**: The interior of Pasteur Crater is relatively flat, suggesting that it may have undergone some degree of filling or basaltic resurfacing in the past. However, it is not as smooth as some other large craters, indicating that the resurfacing was not as extensive.

7. **Central Peaks**: There are central peaks visible in the crater, which are common in large impact craters. These peaks are formed as a result of the rebound of the crustal rocks immediately after the impact.

8. **Wall Terracing**: The walls of Pasteur Crater exhibit signs of terracing, which are step-like structures that form due to the collapse and slumping of the crater walls over time. This is evidence of the crater's evolutionary history.

9. **Impact Melting**: The crater shows evidence of impact melting, where the intense heat generated by the impact caused some of the rock to melt and form glassy or recrystallized materials.

10. **Regolith**: Like much of the Moon's surface, Pasteur Crater is covered by regolith, a layer of fragmented rock and soil that is the result of constant meteorite impacts over billions of years.

Overall, Pasteur Crater is a classic example of a well-preserved large lunar impact crater, exhibiting many of the standard features that are used in the study of lunar geomorphology and the understanding of the Moon's geological history.
