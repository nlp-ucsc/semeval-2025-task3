On October 14th in the 19th century, one of the most notable events was the **Battle of Bannockburn**. This pivotal battle took place in 1314 during the First War of Scottish Independence. Led by Robert the Bruce, the Kingdom of Scotland defeated the Kingdom of England, ensuring Scottish independence.

However, if you're looking for an event that occurred on October 14th specifically, one notable occurrence is the **founding of the city of Savannah, Georgia, USA** on February 12, 1733.

Wait, that was in 1733, not the 19th century. Let me correct that.

Ah, another significant event on October 14th was the **storming of the Bastille** in Paris on July 14, 1789, which was a key event in the French Revolution. But again, that was in 1789, getting close to the 19th century but still in the late 18th century.

Apologies for the confusion. To provide a more accurate response, I should specify that on October 14, 1912, **Theodore Roosevelt**, the 26th President of the United States, was shot in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, while campaigning for the presidency as the candidate for the Progressive Party. Roosevelt survived the assassination attempt and delivered his speech with the bullet wound.

Since the user specified the 19th century, which spans from 1801 to 1900, the most accurate event on October 14, 1899, is the **Boer War** beginning between the British Empire and the two Boer states in South Africa. The war started with the Boer offensive in Natal, leading to the Siege of Ladysmith.

So, to summarize, while the Battle of Bannockburn and the Storming of the Bastille are significant historical events, the direct event on October 14th within the 19th century is the beginning of the Boer War in 1899.
