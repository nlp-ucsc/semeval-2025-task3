The three stages of labor are:

1. **First Stage**: This is the beginning of labor when the cervix starts to dilate and efface (thin out). It is divided into three phases: latent (early), active, and transition. Contractions become stronger and more frequent, helping the cervix to reach full dilation at 10 cm.

2. **Second Stage**: This stage starts when the cervix is fully dilated, and ends with the delivery of the baby. The mother will experience strong contractions and will push the baby down the birth canal and out of the体.

3. **Third Stage**: This is the delivery of the placenta (afterbirth) and the身体's recovery after childbirth. This stage typically lasts anywhere from a few minutes to an hour.
