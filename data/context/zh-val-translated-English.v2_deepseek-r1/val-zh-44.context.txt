Bleeding Kansas was a period of violent civil unrest in the United States, specifically in the Kansas Territory, that occurred from 1854 to 1861. The roots of this conflict can be traced back to the debate over slavery, which was a highly contentious issue leading up to the American Civil War. The Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 played a pivotal role in exacerbating these tensions.

Prior to the Kansas-Nebraska Act, the Missouri Compromise of 1820 had prohibited slavery in the Louisiana Territory north of the 36Â°30' parallel, which included the area that would become Kansas. However, the Kansas-Nebraska Act repealed this provision, allowing the residents of each territory to decide for themselves whether to permit slavery under the principle of popular sovereignty. This led to pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions vying for control of the region, resulting in violent clashes.

The conflict began when pro-slavery settlers, largely from Missouri, and anti-slavery settlers, many of whom were from New England, rushed into the Kansas Territory to influence the decision on slavery. Tensions escalated quickly, leading to acts of violence and intimidation. One of the most notable incidents was the sack of Lawrence in 1856, where pro-slavery forces attacked the anti-slavery town of Lawrence. In retaliation, the abolitionist John Brown led a raid on the pro-slavery settlement at Pottawatomie Creek, killing five men.

The term "Bleeding Kansas" was coined due to the frequent and violent confrontations between these opposing groups. This period not only highlighted the deep divisions over slavery but also set the stage for the broader conflict of the American Civil War. The violence in Kansas subsided somewhat by 1859, but the underlying issues continued to fuel tensions that would eventually lead to the secession of Southern states and the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861.
