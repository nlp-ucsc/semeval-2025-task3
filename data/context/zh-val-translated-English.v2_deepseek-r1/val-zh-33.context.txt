Lugdunum, which is modern-day Lyon, France, was founded in 43 BCE by Lucius Munatius Plancus, a Roman general. The city was established as a strategic military outpost to consolidate Roman control over the region of Gaul (modern-day France and Belgium). It served as an important center for trade, administration, and culture during the Roman era.
