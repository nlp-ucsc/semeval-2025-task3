As of my knowledge cutoff in July 2024, Sandnes Football Club, which is based in Sandnes, Norway, and currently plays in the Norwegian First Division (the second tier of Norwegian football), does not have any widely internationally famous players. The club is a smaller team and primarily features young, up-and-coming players or those with local prominence. If you're looking for specific players, I recommend checking the club's official website or recent sports news for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
