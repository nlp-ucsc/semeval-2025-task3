The World Chess Federation, commonly known as FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs), is the international organization that governs the game of chess worldwide. FIDE was founded in 1924 and is recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Here are the key responsibilities of FIDE:

1. **Promoting the Game of Chess**: FIDE works to promote chess globally, encouraging its practice in all countries, and supports the development of chess as a sport and a cultural activity.

2. **Setting Rules and Standards**: FIDE establishes and updates the official rules of chess, including tournament regulations, time controls, and equipment standards. It ensures uniformity in the rules across all levels of play, from amateur to professional.

3. **Overseeing International Competitions**: FIDE organizes and oversees major international chess competitions, such as the World Chess Championship, the Women's World Chess Championship, the World Junior Chess Championship, and the Chess Olympiad. These events bring together players from around the world to compete at the highest level.

4. **Providing Titles and Ratings**: FIDE awards international titles to players, such as Grandmaster (GM), International Master (IM), Woman Grandmaster (WGM), and others. It also maintains the official Elo rating system, which provides a numerical rating for each player based on their performance in FIDE-rated tournaments. This system helps in ranking players and determining seedings in tournaments.

5. **FIDE World Rankings**: FIDE publishes monthly rankings of the world's top chess players, based on their Elo ratings. These rankings are widely followed and respected in the chess community.

6. **Developing Chess Education**: FIDE promotes chess education and supports the integration of chess into school curricula around the world. It believes that chess can be a valuable educational tool, enhancing critical thinking, problem-solving, and other cognitive skills.

7. **Encouraging Gender Diversity and Inclusivity**: FIDE actively promotes women's chess and supports initiatives to increase participation of female players in the sport. It also works to make chess more inclusive and accessible to players of all ages, abilities, and backgrounds.

8. **Combating Cheating and doping**: FIDE has strict anti-cheating measures in place to ensure fair play in chess tournaments. It also works to prevent doping, although chess is a mind sport and does not involve physical doping in the traditional sense.

9. **Supporting Continental and National Federations**: FIDE works closely with its member federations, which are organized by continent (e.g., European Chess Union, Asian Chess Federation, etc.). It provides support and resources to help these federations develop chess in their regions.

10. **Advocating for Chess Recognition**: FIDE advocates for the recognition of chess as a sport and seeks to include chess in major multi-sport events, such as the Olympic Games. Although chess has not yet been included in the Olympics, FIDE continues to lobby for its inclusion.

11. **Ethical and Governance Responsibilities**: FIDE is responsible for ensuring ethical governance within the sport, promoting transparency, and addressing any disputes or issues that may arise within the chess community.

In summary, FIDE plays a crucial role in the global governance and promotion of chess, ensuring that the game is played fairly, ethically, and with the highest standards worldwide.
