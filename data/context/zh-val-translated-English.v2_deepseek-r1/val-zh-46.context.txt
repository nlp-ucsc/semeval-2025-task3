The protests in Peru from March to April 2022 were primarily triggered by rising fuel and food prices, which were significantly impacting the country's population, particularly the poor and middle class. These economic difficulties were exacerbated by the global economic fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which led to higher prices of essential goods. Additionally, political instability and corruption concerns played a role, as many Peruvians had lost confidence in the government's ability to address their needs effectively. The social unrest highlighted deep-seated issues of inequality and governance in Peru during that period.
