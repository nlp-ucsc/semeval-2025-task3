Metallic bonds, which arise from the delocalized electrons in metals, are responsible for many of the physical properties of metals. Here are some of the key properties influenced by metallic bonding:

1. **High Electrical Conductivity**: The delocalized electrons, also known as free electrons, can move freely within the metal lattice. This movement allows metals to conduct electricity efficiently.

2. **High Thermal Conductivity**: Similar to electrical conductivity, the free electrons also facilitate the transfer of heat through the metal, making metals good thermal conductors.

3. **Malleability and Ductility**: Metallic bonds are relatively strong but not brittle. The ability of the metal ions to slide past each other without breaking the metallic bond allows metals to be shaped into various forms, such as wires (ductility) and sheets (malleability).

4. **High Melting and Boiling Points**: The strong electrostatic attraction between the positively charged metal ions and the delocalized electrons results in high melting and boiling points for most metals. However, some metals like mercury (a liquid at room temperature) are exceptions due to weaker metallic bonding.

5. **Luster**: The free electrons in metals interact with light, causing the surface to reflect light and give metals their characteristic shiny appearance.

6. **Strength and Hardness**: The metallic bond provides the structural integrity of the metal. While pure metals are generally not as hard as some non-metallic substances, alloys (mixtures of metals and other elements) can significantly increase hardness.

7. **Density**: Metals typically have high densities due to the close packing of metal ions in the lattice structure. This high density is a result of the strong metallic bonding.

In summary, properties like conductivity, malleability, thermal conductivity, and strength are direct consequences of the nature of metallic bonds. These properties make metals highly versatile for various applications in engineering, electronics, and everyday use.
