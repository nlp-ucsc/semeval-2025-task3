Based on the available information, Libice Castle (also known as Litice Castle) primarily belongs to the Baroque architectural style, with elements from earlier periods.

The castle's architectural history can be summarized as follows:

1. Original Gothic core: The castle's oldest parts date back to the late 13th or early 14th century, with a gothic core still distinguishable in the two-palace structure[1].

2. Major Baroque reconstruction: The castle underwent significant reconstruction between 1709 and 1719, transforming it into a Baroque building[5]. This Baroque renovation likely gave the castle much of its current appearance and architectural character.

3. Romanesque-Gothic elements: Despite the Baroque reconstruction, the castle retains some Romanesque-Gothic features, particularly in its core structure[5].

4. Neo-Gothic modifications: In 1862-1864, the castle was partially rebuilt in the Windsor Neo-Gothic style, adding another layer to its architectural composition[5].

It's important to note that many European castles, especially those with long histories like Libice Castle, often display a mix of architectural styles due to renovations and additions over centuries. In this case, while the dominant style is Baroque from the early 18th-century reconstruction, the castle incorporates elements from its original Gothic construction, as well as later Neo-Gothic additions.

The castle's architectural evolution reflects the changing tastes and needs of its owners over time, as well as broader trends in European architecture. This blend of styles makes Libice Castle a unique and historically rich structure, showcasing the architectural heritage of the Czech Republic from the medieval period through the Baroque era and into the 19th century.
