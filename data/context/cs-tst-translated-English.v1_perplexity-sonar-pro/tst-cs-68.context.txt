The 2010 film by Ondřej Trojan that tells the story of a group of classmates during the normalization period in Czechoslovakia is called "Občanský průkaz" (Identity Card)[4][8]. 

This film is set in the 1970s, specifically covering the years 1973 to 1977, which was during the more hardline period of normalization in Czechoslovakia following the Prague Spring of 1968[8]. The film follows the lives of four teenage friends - Petr, Popelka, Aleš, and Míťa - as they come of age and navigate life under the communist regime.

"Občanský průkaz" is an example of the retro aesthetic that has been employed in Czech cinema to depict the normalization era[6]. This approach often uses visual nostalgia and a focus on the everyday lives of characters to explore this historical period. The film is based on a novel by Petr Šabach and was adapted for the screen by Petr Jarchovský, who has collaborated with Trojan on several films that look back at the communist era in Czechoslovakia[6][8].

By setting the film during this specific timeframe, Trojan aimed to capture the zeitgeist of the normalization period, showcasing how young people experienced and responded to the political and social realities of life under communism in 1970s Czechoslovakia[4][8].
