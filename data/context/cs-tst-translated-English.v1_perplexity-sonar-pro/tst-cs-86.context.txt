Zvíkov Castle is located at the confluence of the Vltava and Otava rivers in the Czech Republic[1][3][7]. This strategic location on a steep promontory above where these two rivers meet provided an ideal defensive position for the castle[2][3].

The castle's unique setting at this confluence offered several advantages:

1. Natural defense: The steep rocky outcrop where the rivers meet created a naturally defensible position[2][3].

2. Control of waterways: The location allowed control over traffic and trade along both the Vltava and Otava rivers.

3. Scenic views: The elevated position provides panoramic views of the surrounding landscape and the merging rivers[7].

4. Strategic importance: The confluence was a significant geographical feature, making the castle an important stronghold in the region[5].

Before the construction of the Orlík Dam between 1954 and 1962, the castle would have had an even more dramatic appearance, rising high above the meeting point of the two rivers[3]. The dam's creation has somewhat altered the immediate surroundings, but the castle still maintains its impressive position overlooking the confluence[7].

Today, visitors to Zvíkov Castle can enjoy stunning views of where the Vltava and Otava rivers meet from various vantage points within the castle complex, including the palace terraces and the Hlízová Tower[7][9].
