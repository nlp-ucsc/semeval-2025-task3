The famous glowing corridor, known as the Infinite Corridor, is located at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts[1]. This 251-meter (823 ft) hallway runs through the main buildings of MIT, specifically parts of the buildings numbered 7, 3, 10, 4, and 8 (from west to east)[1].

The Infinite Corridor is notable for a phenomenon called MIThenge, which occurs twice a year in mid-November and late January. During these times, the corridor aligns perfectly with the position of the sun, causing sunlight to fill the entire length of the hallway[1]. This event is celebrated by students, faculty, and staff at MIT.

The corridor serves as a central spine of the original MIT buildings designed by William W. Bosworth in 1913. It's not only important for linking major MIT buildings but also provides the most direct indoor route between the east and west ends of the campus[1].

The main entrance to the Infinite Corridor is through Lobby 7, which opens onto Massachusetts Avenue. This entrance is often referred to as "77 MassAve," an abbreviation of its official street address[1].
