The author of the novel "The Good Soldier Švejk" is Jaroslav Hašek[1][2]. This satirical novel, considered a classic of Czech literature, was written in the years following World War I and published in installments from 1921 to 1923[1][3]. Hašek, a Czech writer and journalist, drew from his own experiences as a soldier in the Austro-Hungarian Army to create the character of Josef Švejk, a seemingly simple-minded soldier whose adventures during World War I form the basis of the novel[2][3].
