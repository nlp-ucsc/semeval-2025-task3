Kelly Cheng and Sara Hughes of the United States became the women's beach volleyball world champions in 2023[2]. They defeated the defending champions Eduarda 'Duda' Lisboa and Ana Patr√≠cia Ramos of Brazil in the final match, winning in two sets with scores of 21-16 and 24-22[2].

This victory marked several significant achievements:

1. It was the first world title for Cheng and Hughes as a pair[2].

2. They became the third different team from the United States to win the World Championships, joining three-time winners Kerri Walsh Jennings and Misty May-Treanor (2003, 2005, 2007) and April Ross and Jennifer Kessy (2009)[2].

3. This victory ended a 14-year drought for the United States in the women's beach volleyball World Championships[2].

4. The win also secured a berth for the United States at the 2024 Paris Olympics[2].

Cheng and Hughes' partnership has an interesting history. They were successful youth partners, then split up for four years before reuniting in late 2022[4]. Since their reunion, they have quickly risen to become one of the top teams in the world, with their World Championship victory in Tlaxcala, Mexico, being the pinnacle of their achievements so far[2][4].
