Jaroslav Dušek played the character Saša Mašláň in the 1999 Czech film Pelíšky (known in English as Cosy Dens)[1][3][4][7]. Dušek was part of the main cast of this popular Czech comedy-drama directed by Jan Hřebejk[1][6]. The film is set during the months leading up to the Prague Spring of 1968 and follows the lives of two neighboring families with contrasting political views[1][3]. Dušek's character Saša Mašláň is described as one of the more unsympathetic characters in the film[2]. At the time of filming, Dušek would have been around 37 years old[9].
