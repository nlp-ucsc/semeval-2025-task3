David Černý is a renowned Czech sculptor and artist, born on December 15, 1967, in Prague, Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic)[2][4]. He is widely recognized for his provocative, controversial, and often satirical public art installations that challenge societal norms and political ideologies[1][4].

Černý gained international notoriety in 1991 when he painted a Soviet tank pink. This tank, which served as a war memorial in central Prague, became a symbol of his rebellious artistic spirit and civil disobedience[2][4]. This act briefly led to his arrest but also catapulted him into the spotlight as a daring and unconventional artist[3].

Some of Černý's most famous works include:

1. Tower Babies (2000): A series of cast figures of crawling infants attached to the Žižkov Television Tower in Prague[2].

2. Entropa (2009): A controversial sculpture created for the Czech presidency of the Council of the European Union, which depicted stereotypes of EU member states[2].

3. London Booster (2012): A double-decker bus with mechanical arms doing push-ups, created for the 2012 Summer Olympics[2].

4. Metalmorphosis: A spinning, metallic, head-shaped fountain in Charlotte, North Carolina[3].

5. The Head of Franz Kafka: A massive, rotating sculpture in Prague consisting of 42 moving layers[4].

Černý's artistic style is characterized by its boldness, sarcastic humor, and willingness to engage with sensitive political, historical, and social themes[1]. He often uses unconventional materials and techniques, including his proprietary method of casting three-dimensional objects that appear translucent[1].

Throughout his career, Černý has received several accolades, including the Jindřich Chalupecký Award in 2000 for the most promising Czech artist under 35[2][3]. He has also participated in numerous exhibitions worldwide and has permanent installations in various locations, particularly in Prague[1][4].

Černý's work consistently sparks debate and controversy, earning him a reputation as one of the most provocative artists of his generation. His art serves as a form of social commentary, often challenging viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about society, politics, and human nature[4][6].

In April 2023, Černý opened his own gallery space called Musoleum in Prague's Smíchov district, further cementing his place in the contemporary art world[2].
