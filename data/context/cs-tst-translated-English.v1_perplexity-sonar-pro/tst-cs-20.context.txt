The church in Slavkovice designed by architect Ludvík Kolek is called the Pilgrimage Church of Divine Mercy and Saint Faustina (Poutní kostel Božího milosrdenství a svaté Faustyny in Czech)[4][6].

This modern church was built between 2005 and 2008[4][6]. Construction began in May 2005, and the church was consecrated on March 30, 2008, by Bishop Vojtěch Cikrle[3][4]. 

The design of the church symbolizes Divine Mercy, with water flowing from the roof into a stone paten in front of the entrance, representing how Divine Mercy bestows gifts upon believers[4]. The church is co-dedicated to Saint Faustina Kowalska, a Polish nun who lived from 1905 to 1938[4].

The church was funded by donations from believers in the Czech Republic and abroad, costing approximately 10 million Czech crowns for the building itself, with an additional 3 million crowns for the pilgrimage area, organ, and Stations of the Cross[4]. The Stations of the Cross, as well as a monstrance on the roof peak and a Marian symbol on the tower, were created by artistic blacksmith Pavel Tasovský[4].

This church is one of several notable religious buildings designed by Ludvík Kolek, who was known for his work on ecclesiastical projects and his contributions to modern sacred architecture[8].
