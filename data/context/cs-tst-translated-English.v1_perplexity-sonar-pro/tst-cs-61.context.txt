The Czech leftist artistic union that operated from 1920 to 1930 was called Devětsil (Umělecký Svaz Devětsil)[1][2][4]. 

Devětsil was an association of Czech avant-garde artists founded in 1920 in Prague. The name went through several changes - it was initially called U.S. Devětsil (Umělecký Svaz Devětsil – Devětsil Artistic Federation), and from 1925 it was known as Svaz moderní kultury Devětsil (the Devětsil Union of Modern Culture)[2].

Key aspects of Devětsil include:

1. Membership: It comprised poets, writers, artists, and designers[4].

2. Artistic focus: The group's artistic output was varied but typically centered on magic realism, proletkult, and from 1923 onwards, Poetism - an artistic program formulated by Vítězslav Nezval and Karel Teige[2].

3. Activities: Devětsil was very active in organizing the Czech art scene of the period. They published several art magazines including ReD (Revue Devětsilu), Disk, and Pásmo. They also produced occasional anthologies (most importantly Devětsil and Život) and organized several exhibitions[2].

4. Artistic production: While Devětsil artists primarily produced poetry and illustration, they also made contributions to many other art forms, including sculpture, film, and calligraphy[2].

5. Influence: Devětsil was highly influential in avant-garde book design during the interwar period[4].

6. Duration: The movement discontinued its activities in 1930 in Prague (and in 1927 in Brno, where there was also an active group from 1923)[2].

Devětsil played a crucial role in shaping the Czech avant-garde movement, encompassing various artistic styles including Poetism, Constructivism, and later influencing Surrealism[2][4].
