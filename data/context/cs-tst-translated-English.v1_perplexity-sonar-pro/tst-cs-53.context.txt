Bauer finished second behind gold medalist Andrus Veerpalu of Estonia and ahead of bronze medalist Tobias Angerer of Germany[1][2].

This silver medal performance was a significant achievement for Bauer and the Czech Republic. It marked the second medal for the Czech team at the Turin Olympics[9]. Bauer's success in this event showcased his strength in classical technique cross-country skiing, particularly in the 15 km distance.
