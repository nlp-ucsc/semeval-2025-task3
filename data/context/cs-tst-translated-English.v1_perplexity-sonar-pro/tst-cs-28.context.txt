Based on the search results provided, there is no specific information about Rudolf Těsnohlídek writing for a particular periodical from the field during the Balkan Wars in 1912. The search results do not mention Těsnohlídek's involvement as a war correspondent during this conflict.

However, the search results do provide some relevant context about journalism during the Balkan Wars:

1. An estimated 200 to 300 journalists from around the world covered the war in the Balkans in November 1912[2].

2. Many foreign correspondents rushed to Bulgaria, which was identified as the center of major military developments. The Bulgarian government implemented a system to control and identify journalists[6].

3. In Serbia, 45 journalists from around the world assembled in Belgrade to cover the First Balkan War[6].

4. The search results mention several specific journalists who covered the Balkan Wars, but Rudolf Těsnohlídek is not among them[6].

5. There is mention of a Czech journalist, Vladimir Sis, who reported on the Balkan War (1912-1913) when he was 23 years old[8][9].

Without more specific information about Rudolf Těsnohlídek's activities during this period, I cannot confirm which periodical, if any, he might have written for during the Balkan Wars in 1912. To answer this question accurately, we would need additional sources that specifically discuss Těsnohlídek's journalistic work during that time.
