The Czechoslovak animated series you're asking about is called "Maxipes Fík" (literally "Fig the Maxidog")[1]. This popular children's TV series features the adventures of a large talking dog named Fík and his owner, a little girl called Ája[3].

"Maxipes Fík" was one of the most beloved series created for the children's television programme Večerníček[1]. The show first aired in 1975, with a second series launched in 1982[1]. The creator and screenwriter of the series was Rudolf Čechura, while the animation was done by Jiří Šalamoun[1]. The distinctive voice of Fík was provided by actor Josef Dvořák, and the music was composed by Petr Skoumal[1][3].

The series follows the adventures of Fík and Ája, who live together in the town of Ahníkov, near Kadaň[3]. In the first series, Ája introduces Fík to her world, and as he grows bigger, they embark on various adventures together[5]. The second series, titled "Divoké sny Maxipsa Fíka" (Wild Dreams of Maxidog Fík), slightly changed the format, with each episode beginning with Fík waking up and recounting his wild dreams to Ája[5].

The animation style of "Maxipes Fík" is described as basic and cartoony, but the humor is clever and appeals to both children and adults[5]. The series is known for its lovingly animated illustrations by Jiří Šalamoun, which use a classic Czech pub-style illustration scheme[7].

"Maxipes Fík" has become a cultural icon in the Czech Republic, with Fík's birthday even being celebrated in the town of Kadaň[1]. The enduring popularity of the series is a testament to its charm and the creative talents of its makers.
