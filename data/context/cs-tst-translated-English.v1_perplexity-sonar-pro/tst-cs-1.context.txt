The Sudetenland refers to the northern, southern, and western border regions of the former Czechoslovakia (now part of the Czech Republic) that were primarily inhabited by ethnic Germans[1]. Specifically, it encompasses areas in the following regions of the present-day Czech Republic:

1. Parts of Karlovy Vary (Carlsbad)
2. Liberec
3. Olomouc
4. Moravia-Silesia 
5. South Moravia
6. Ústí nad Labem

These areas are located along the borders with Germany, Austria, and Poland[1]. The Sudetenland is named after the Sudeten Mountains, which run along the northern Czech border and Lower Silesia (now in Poland)[1]. However, the region extended beyond just the mountain areas to include the German-speaking communities in the borderlands.

Geographically, the Sudetenland formed a horseshoe shape around the Czech lands of Bohemia and Moravia. It included:

1. The mountainous areas in northern Bohemia along the German and Polish borders
2. The western part of Czech Silesia
3. Northern Moravia along the Polish border
4. Southern Bohemia along the Austrian border

It's important to note that the term "Sudetenland" did not come into common usage until after World War I, when Austria-Hungary was dismantled and the Sudeten Germans found themselves living in the newly created country of Czechoslovakia[1]. The region became a major point of contention in the lead-up to World War II, ultimately being annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938 as a result of the Munich Agreement[1][5].

Today, after the expulsion of most ethnic Germans following World War II, these areas are predominantly inhabited by Czech speakers and are fully integrated parts of the Czech Republic[1].
