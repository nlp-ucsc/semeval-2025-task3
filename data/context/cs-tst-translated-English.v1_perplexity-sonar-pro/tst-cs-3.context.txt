Uranium mining has a long history in the Czech Republic, with several key areas where uranium was extracted:

1. Jáchymov (Western Bohemia): 
Uranium mining in the Czech Republic began here in 1946. Jáchymov was one of the first sites where uranium ore was extracted on a large scale[3].

2. Příbram (Central Bohemia):
This was a major uranium mining district, with numerous mines including Mine No. 16 in Háje[4].

3. Rožná (Western Moravia): 
The Rožná mine began operations in 1957 and was the last operating uranium mine in Central Europe. It continued selective mining until March 2017[5][6].

4. Stráž pod Ralskem (Northern Bohemia):
This area used in-situ leaching (ISL) methods for uranium extraction. Currently, uranium is only extracted here as a by-product of environmental remediation efforts[6][7].

5. Hamr (Northern Bohemia):
This was another significant uranium production center[3].

6. Brzkov (near Jihlava):
While not currently active, this site has been considered for potential future mining, with estimated reserves of about 3,150 tonnes of uranium[7].

7. Dolní Rožínka:
This area housed a uranium mill for processing ore[1].

8. Osečná-Kotel (near Liberec):
This deposit was explored but faced opposition to mining[1].

The peak of uranium production in the Czech Republic occurred around 1960, reaching about 3,000 tonnes per year. From 1946 to 1996, the cumulative production totaled 104,748 tonnes of uranium[3]. Currently, commercial uranium mining has ceased, with only small amounts extracted as a byproduct of remediation efforts[6][7].
