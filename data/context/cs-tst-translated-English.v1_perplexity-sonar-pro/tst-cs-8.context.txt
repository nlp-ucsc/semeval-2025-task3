Tomáš Baťa established his shoe company in Zlín, a town in southeastern Moravia, which was then part of Austria-Hungary (now in the Czech Republic)[1][2]. The T. & A. Baťa Shoe Company was founded on September 21, 1894, by Tomáš Baťa along with his siblings Antonín and Anna[2][4][10].

At the time of the company's founding, Zlín was a small provincial town with only about 3,000 inhabitants[4]. However, under Baťa's leadership, the company grew rapidly, transforming Zlín into a major industrial center:

1. By 1910, Zlín had become a significant center of the shoemaking industry[10].
2. During World War I, the Baťa factory expanded significantly, employing 4,000 workers by 1918[10].
3. In 1921, Zlín's population was 4,678. By 1930, it had grown to 21,582, and by 1937, it reached 37,342[10].

Tomáš Baťa not only developed his company in Zlín but also played a crucial role in the city's development:

1. He was elected mayor of Zlín in 1923[8].
2. Under his leadership, the company built employee housing, schools, recreational facilities, and other urban amenities[8].
3. Zlín was transformed into a modern, functionalist city with the help of prominent architects like František L. Gahura[8][10].

The growth of the Baťa company in Zlín was so significant that by the late 1920s and early 1930s, the city had become the center of a global shoe empire, with Baťa shops and factories spreading across Europe, Asia, and North America[6][8].
