Tábor was built as a bastion of the Hussites in 1420 in southern Bohemia. The city was established as a command center and stronghold for the radical Hussite movement during the Hussite Wars[1][2]. 

Some key details about the founding of Tábor:

- It was founded in the spring of 1420, likely by Petr Hromádka of Jistebnice and other members of the most radical wing of the Hussites, who became known as the Taborites[4].

- The city took its name from Mount Tabor in present-day Israel. However, the word "tábor" in Czech also means "camp" or "encampment", which was fitting given its origins as a military base[2].

- Tábor quickly became the center of the most militant Hussites. It had a puritanical character in its ecclesiastical organization and a democratic form of government[3].

- The famous Hussite military leader Jan Žižka was one of the four elected captains who led Tábor in its early days[3].

- Soon after its founding, the Taborites were victorious in the Battle of Tábor, cementing the city's importance[4].

- From Tábor, the Hussites led many of their successful military expeditions against Catholic forces during the wars[2][4].

The establishment of Tábor as a Hussite stronghold was a crucial development in the Hussite Wars, providing the reformist movement with a well-fortified base of operations in southern Bohemia. Its founding represents a key moment in the Hussites' transition from a purely religious movement to an organized military and political force.
