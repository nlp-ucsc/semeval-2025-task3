Bezděkov Castle is located in the Klatovy District of the Czech Republic[1][6][9]. This castle is situated in the village of Bezděkov, which is part of the Plzeň Region. Specifically, Bezděkov is located about 5 km (3 mi) west of Klatovy and 40 km (25 mi) south of Plzeň[1].

The castle in Bezděkov is described as a Neogothic castle, which suggests it was built or extensively renovated in the Gothic Revival style popular in the 19th century[6][9]. The original castle on this site was built in 1737, but it was later rebuilt into its current Gothic Revival form between 1854 and 1856 by the architect Vojtěch Ignác Ullmann[1].

It's worth noting that this Bezděkov Castle should not be confused with other similarly named castles in the Czech Republic, such as Bezděz Castle, which is located in a different region (the Liberec Region)[3].

The Bezděkov Castle in the Klatovy District is currently privately owned and is not accessible to the public[1]. However, it remains a significant landmark in the area, along with other notable sights in Bezděkov such as the Church of Saint Anne (dating from 1693) and the Church of Saint Wenceslaus (built in 1899–1901)[1].
