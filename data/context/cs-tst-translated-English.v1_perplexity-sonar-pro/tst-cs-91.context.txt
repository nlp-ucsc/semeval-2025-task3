The oldest Czech chronicle is the Chronicle of Dalimil (Czech: Dalimilova kronika)[1][2]. This chronicle holds several notable distinctions:

1. It is the first chronicle written in the Old Czech language, rather than Latin which was more common for historical texts at the time[1][4].

2. It was composed in verse by an unknown author at the beginning of the 14th century, likely between 1309-1314[1][2].

3. The chronicle compiles information from older Czech chronicles written in Latin, such as the Chronica Boemorum, as well as the author's own experiences[1].

4. It covers events up to 1314, though later editions often include entries by other authors describing events up to 1319[1].

The Chronicle of Dalimil is significant not only for its historical content but also for its linguistic and literary value. It marks an important transition in Czech literature from Latin to the vernacular language. The chronicle presents a nationalistic view of Czech history, often portraying Germans in a negative light, which reflects the political tensions of the time[1][3].

It's worth noting that the name "Dalimil" is actually a misnomer. The true identity of the author remains unknown, and the attribution to "Dalimil" was a later mistake that has persisted for convenience[2]. Despite this, the chronicle remains an invaluable source for understanding medieval Czech history and the development of Czech national identity.
