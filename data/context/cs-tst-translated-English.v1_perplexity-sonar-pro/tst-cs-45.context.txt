The ferry Vrané nad Vltavou – Strnady operates across the Vltava River in the Czech Republic[1][2]. The Vltava is the longest river in the Czech Republic and a major waterway flowing through the country[5].

This ferry connects the town of Vrané nad Vltavou on one bank to the area of Strnady on the opposite bank[2]. Specifically:

- It runs from a landing near the center of Vrané nad Vltavou to an area near a forestry research institute on the outskirts of the Strnady district[2].
- The ferry is located at river kilometer 70.200 (measured from Mělník) or 174.60 according to the old numbering system[2].
- It has been in operation for several centuries, with the earliest recorded mention of a ferryman at this location dating back to 1382[2].

The Vltava River at this point is relatively wide, making the ferry an important local transportation link. The ferry uses the river's current to propel itself across, guided by cables, in a system known as a reaction ferry[1][2].
