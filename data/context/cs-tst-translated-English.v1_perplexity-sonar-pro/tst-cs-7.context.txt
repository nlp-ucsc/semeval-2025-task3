The character associated with the town of Jičín is Rumcajs (Czech: Loupežník Rumcajs)[1][3]. Rumcajs is a fictional gallant robber who, along with his wife Manka and son Cipísek, has been an integral part of Jičín's cultural identity for over 50 years[1].

Rumcajs was created by Czech writer Václav Čtvrtek and artist Radek Pilař. The character first appeared in children's animated television series broadcast as part of the Večerníček TV program in Czechoslovakia from 1967 to 1984, spanning 52 episodes in total[3].

According to the story, Rumcajs was originally a cobbler in Jičín. He was expelled to the (fictional) Řáholec forest "for the insult of mayor's foot" after he claimed to have seen larger feet than those of the town mayor Humpál. As a result, Rumcajs became a Robin Hood-like figure, living in a cave in the forest[3].

Rumcajs is characterized by his distinctive appearance, which includes:

1. A tall red hat
2. A beard with a bee swarm
3. A pistol loaded with acorns[3]

The town of Jičín has embraced its association with this fairy tale character. There are several Rumcajs-related attractions in the town, including a pub called "At Rumcajs'" and an annual festival called "Jičín – město pohádky" (Jičín – the Town of the Fairy Tale)[3].

The stories of Rumcajs, along with other characters created by Václav Čtvrtek, have become an essential part of Czech children's literature and popular culture, firmly connecting the fictional robber with the real town of Jičín[1][3].
