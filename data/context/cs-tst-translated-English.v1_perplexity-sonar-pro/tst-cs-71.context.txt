The fifth president of Czechoslovakia, who served from 1953 to 1957, was Antonín Zápotocký[2][5][9]. 

Antonín Zápotocký took office on March 21, 1953, following the death of his predecessor Klement Gottwald[4]. He served as president until his own death on November 13, 1957[2][5]. 

Prior to becoming president, Zápotocký had served as the Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia from 1948 to 1953[5]. He was a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ) and was part of the communist regime that took control of the country in 1948[6].

Zápotocký's presidency was relatively short, lasting just over 4 years. After his death, he was succeeded by Antonín Novotný, who had already been serving as the First Secretary of the Communist Party since 1953[4][7]. Novotný would go on to combine both roles, serving as both President and Party leader until 1968[1][7].
