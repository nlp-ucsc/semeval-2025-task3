The largest glacial lake in the Czech Republic is Černé jezero, also known as the Black Lake[1][3][6]. 

Some key facts about Černé jezero:

- It is located in the Bohemian Forest (Šumava) near the village of Železná Ruda[1][3].

- With a surface area of 18.43-18.47 hectares, it is the largest naturally formed lake in the Czech Republic[1][3].

- It has a maximum depth of 39.8-40 meters, making it the deepest lake in the Šumava region[1][3].

- The lake lies at an altitude of 1008 meters above sea level[3].

- It was formed during the last ice age by glacial activity[3].

- The name "Black Lake" comes from the dark appearance of its waters, caused by the reflection of the surrounding dense forests and dark sediment on the lake bottom[1][3].

- Together with nearby Čertovo jezero (Devil's Lake), it forms part of the Black and Devil's Lakes National Nature Reserve[5].

- The lake has no visible tributary and is fed by underground springs rising at the foot of the adjacent Jezerní hora (Lake Mountain)[1].

Černé jezero is not only the largest glacial lake in the Czech Republic, but also considered one of the most beautiful natural attractions in the Šumava region, offering visitors a picturesque landscape surrounded by pristine forests and mountains[1][4].
