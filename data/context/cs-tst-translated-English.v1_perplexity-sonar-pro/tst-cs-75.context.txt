Based on the search results provided, the co-founder of the Jára Cimrman Theatre who likely played the dual role of Prince Jasoň / Prince Drsoň in the play "Dlouhý, Široký a Krátkozraký" (Long, Broad and Shortsight) is Zdeněk Svěrák.

Zdeněk Svěrák is mentioned multiple times in the search results as one of the key figures in the creation and development of the Jára Cimrman Theatre:

1. He was one of the founders of the theatre in 1967, along with Jiri Sebanek, Ladislav Smoljak, and Milon Cepelka[1].

2. Svěrák is noted as a co-writer of many of the theatre's plays, including "Dlouhý, Široký a Krátkozraký" from 1974, which he wrote together with Ladislav Smoljak[2].

3. He is described as a co-founder of the theatre and is perhaps best known for his 1996 Oscar-winning performance in the film Kolya[6][7].

While the search results don't explicitly state that Svěrák played the dual role of Prince Jasoň / Prince Drsoň, given his prominent role in the theatre as both a founder and performer, it's highly likely that he took on this role in the play "Dlouhý, Široký a Krátkozraký".
