The first chairman of ODS (Civic Democratic Party) was Václav Klaus[1]. He served as the party's leader from its founding on April 21, 1991 until December 15, 2002[1].

Václav Klaus played a crucial role in establishing the ODS as one of the major political parties in the Czech Republic after the fall of communism. The party was founded in 1991 as one of two successors to the Civic Forum, representing the pro-free market wing of that movement[1]. Klaus was elected as the first president of the newly formed ODS at its founding assembly[1].

Under Klaus's leadership, the ODS quickly became a dominant force in Czech politics. The party won the 1992 legislative election, forming a center-right coalition government with Klaus as prime minister[1]. This government oversaw the peaceful dissolution of Czechoslovakia and the establishment of the independent Czech Republic in 1993.

Klaus remained a influential figure in Czech politics throughout his tenure as ODS chairman, serving as Prime Minister of the Czech Republic from 1993 to 1997[1]. His leadership helped establish the ODS as a major conservative, pro-market party that has remained a significant player in Czech politics to this day.
