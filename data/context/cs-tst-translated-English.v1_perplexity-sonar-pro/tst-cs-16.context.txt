I apologize, but I don't have enough specific information from the search results to provide details about the mission of the Paraple Center. The search results don't contain clear information about this particular organization's mission.

However, based on some context clues, it appears the Paraple Center may be an organization that works with people who use wheelchairs or have spinal cord injuries. One search result mentions "wheelchairs users from Paraple" attending the National Theatre[9], suggesting it's a center that serves wheelchair users. Another result refers to "spinal injury survivors" in connection with a similar-sounding name "CENTRUM PARAPLE"[8].

Without more direct information about the Paraple Center specifically, I can't confidently state its mission. If you're looking for accurate details about this organization's goals and purpose, I'd recommend checking their official website or contacting them directly for the most up-to-date and reliable information about their mission.
