The 1980 feature film directed by Jiří Menzel, based on the book by Bohumil Hrabal, which tells the story of a brewery and the family of its manager during the First Republic, is called "Cutting It Short" (Czech: Postřižiny)[1][3][4]. 

This Czech comedy film is an adaptation of Hrabal's novel of the same name and is set in a small-town brewery during the era of the First Czechoslovak Republic[3][4]. The film, also known by its alternate English title "Shortcuts," centers around three main characters:

1. Maryška: A beautiful, mischievous blonde who loves beer and meat
2. Francin: Maryška's husband and the meticulous brewery manager
3. Pepin: Francin's eccentric and noisy brother who comes to stay[3][4]

The story is largely autobiographical, drawing on Hrabal's childhood memories of Nymburk, the town where his stepfather was a brewery manager[5]. The film is known for its nostalgic and poetic portrayal of small-town life, filled with humorous episodes and vivid characters[2][4].

"Cutting It Short" is notable for its warm, lyrical quality, achieved through the collaboration of Menzel with cinematographer Jaromír Šofr, who used variations of light, shade, and pastel colors to create a harmonious, nostalgic atmosphere[3][4]. The film was well-received both in Czechoslovakia and internationally, being one of the few Czech films from the early 1980s to be widely distributed in Europe and overseas[7].
