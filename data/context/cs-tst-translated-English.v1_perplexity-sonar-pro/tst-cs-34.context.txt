The Czech Republic has had a lion as the main symbol in its national emblem since 1992, when the country became an independent state following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia. However, the history of the lion symbol in Czech heraldry goes back much further.

The use of the lion as a symbol for Czech lands can be traced back to the 13th century:

1. The first documented use of a lion as a symbol of the ruling Přemyslid dynasty dates to 1213, appearing on the equestrian seal of Moravian Margrave Vladislav Jindřich[1][4].

2. King Přemysl Otakar II officially introduced the silver double-tailed lion on a red field as the coat of arms of Bohemia in 1249[6].

3. Since then, the double-tailed lion has remained a consistent symbol in the heraldry of Bohemia and later the Czech lands[1][6].

After the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the lion continued to be a central element in the country's coat of arms. When the Czech Republic became an independent state in 1993, it adopted its current coat of arms, which prominently features the double-tailed lion[1][8].

So while the lion has been associated with Czech lands for centuries, its current official status as the main symbol in the national emblem of the Czech Republic dates specifically to 1992, when the new constitution was adopted in preparation for the country's independence in 1993[8].
