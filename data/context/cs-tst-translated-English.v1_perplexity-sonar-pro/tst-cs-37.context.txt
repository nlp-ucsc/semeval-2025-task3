The largest annual poll of popularity for Czech singers and bands, organized since 1996, is called Český slavík (Czech Nightingale)[1][4]. This poll is the successor to the Zlatý slavík (Golden Nightingale) poll that existed during the Czechoslovak era[1].

Some key points about Český slavík:

1. It was established in 1996 as a continuation of the previous Zlatý slavík poll after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia[1].

2. It is considered one of the most prestigious music awards in the Czech Republic.

3. The poll allows fans to vote for their favorite artists in various categories, typically including male singers, female singers, and bands.

4. From 1999 to 2017, it was known as Český slavík Mattoni due to sponsorship by the Carlsbad Mineral Water company[1].

5. In 2008, the poll was extended to include a "Slavík bez hranic" (No Limits Nightingale) category, which awards artists from Slovakia[1].

6. Karel Gott, often referred to as "the Golden Voice of Prague," dominated this poll, winning the male singer category 42 times, with his last win in 2017[3][4].

The Český slavík poll has become an important indicator of popularity in the Czech music industry, reflecting public opinion and often highlighting both established stars and rising talents in the Czech music scene.
