The author of the poems "Edison" and "Signál času" is Vítězslav Nezval[2][4][7]. Vítězslav Nezval was a prominent Czech poet, writer, and translator who lived from 1900 to 1958[4][7]. He was one of the most prolific avant-garde Czech writers in the first half of the 20th century and played a significant role in the Surrealist movement in Czechoslovakia[7].

"Edison" is considered one of Nezval's most important works[2]. It is an epic poem written in 1927[10] and was later included in a collection called "Básně noci" (Poems of the Night)[2][10]. The poem consists of five cantos, as evidenced by its full Czech title "Edison: báseň o pěti zpěvech" (Edison: Poem with Five Cantos)[8].

"Signál času" (Signal of Time) is another significant work by Nezval, often mentioned alongside "Edison"[2]. Both poems are frequently cited as examples of Nezval's most notable contributions to Czech literature[2][4].

Nezval's poetic style was influenced by modern French literature, and he was known for his surrealist approach[2]. His work often explored themes related to modern life, technology, and the human experience, which is evident in his choice to write about a figure like Thomas Edison[1][3].

It's worth noting that an English translation of "Edison" was published in 2003, translated by Ewald Osers[7], making this important work accessible to a wider audience.
