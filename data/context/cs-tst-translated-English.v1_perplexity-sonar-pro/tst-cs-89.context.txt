Karlovy Vary is located at the confluence of the Ohře and Teplá rivers[1][2][3][5]. The city is situated in western Bohemia, Czech Republic, approximately 106-130 kilometers west of Prague[3][5].

The Ohře River flows across the city, while the Teplá River runs through the valley where many of Karlovy Vary's famous thermal springs are found[1][3]. The Teplá River is particularly significant for the spa town, as it's along this river that the city built its five famous colonnades showcasing the thermal springs[1].

Additionally, some sources also mention a third river, the Rolava, which joins the confluence in the area[3][9]. However, the Ohře and Teplá are consistently cited as the main rivers forming the confluence at Karlovy Vary.

The location of these rivers has played a crucial role in the city's history and development as a spa town. Legend has it that King Charles IV discovered the hot springs while hunting in the forests near the confluence of these rivers, leading to the foundation of the town in the 14th century[5].
