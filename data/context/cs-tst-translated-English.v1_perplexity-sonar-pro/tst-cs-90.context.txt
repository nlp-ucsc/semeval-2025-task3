HC Kometa Brno was originally founded in 1953 under the name Rudá hvězda Brno, which means "Red Star Brno" in English[1]. The club has undergone several name changes throughout its history:

1. 1953-1962: TJ Rudá Hvězda Brno (Red Star Brno)
2. 1962-1976: TJ ZKL Brno 
3. 1976-1990: TJ Zetor Brno
4. 1990-1992: HC Zetor Brno
5. 1992-1994: HC Královopolská Brno
6. 1994-1995: HC Kometa Brno
7. 1995-1996: HC Kometa Brno BVV
8. 1996-2002: HC Kometa Brno
9. 2002-2003: HC Kometa/Vyškov
10. 2003-present: HC Kometa Brno[3][5]

The club was initially established as an army ice hockey team, with the majority of players transferred from two existing hockey clubs in Brno: TJ Spartak Brno Zbrojovka and TJ Spartak GZ Královo Pole[1]. The name "Kometa" (meaning "Comet" in English) was actually the team's nickname since the 1950s, despite the official name being "Red Star." The team was commonly referred to by this nickname from its early years[1]. However, it wasn't until 1994 that the club officially adopted "Kometa" as part of its name[1][8].
