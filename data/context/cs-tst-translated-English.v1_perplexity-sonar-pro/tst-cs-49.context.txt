Public broadcasting of Czechoslovak Television in Czechoslovakia began in 1953. Specifically, the first official broadcast took place on May 1, 1953[1][2][4]. This date marks the beginning of regular television broadcasting in Czechoslovakia.

Some key points about the early history of Czechoslovak Television:

1. Czechoslovak Television (ČST) was founded on May 1, 1953, as the state television broadcaster of Czechoslovakia[2].

2. The first public broadcast featured a short performance by František Filipovský on May 1, 1953[2].

3. Regular broadcasts began in February 1954, initially airing 3 days a week. This increased to 4 days later that year, 5 days in 1955, and finally 7 days a week in 1958[1].

4. The first live broadcast was made on February 11, 1955, featuring an ice hockey match from Prague[2].

5. Prior to 1953, there were experimental television broadcasts and developments in Czechoslovakia. For example, the first operational equipment for television broadcasting was presented in 1948 at the International Radio Exhibition MEVRO in Prague[1].

It's worth noting that while 1953 marks the official start of public broadcasting, television technology and experiments in Czechoslovakia date back to the 1930s, with various inventors and engineers working on television systems[1][5]. However, the establishment of regular public broadcasting under Czechoslovak Television began in 1953.
