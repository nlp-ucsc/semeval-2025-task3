The funeral that preceded the closure of Czech universities on November 17, 1939, was that of Jan Opletal, a student of the Medical Faculty at Charles University in Prague[1][10].

Jan Opletal was shot during an anti-Nazi demonstration on October 28, 1939, which was held to commemorate the anniversary of Czechoslovak independence[8]. He was severely injured and died from his wounds on November 11, 1939[10].

Opletal's funeral procession took place on November 15, 1939[1][2]. It began as a solemn occasion but quickly transformed into a large anti-Nazi demonstration:

1. The procession attracted thousands of students and Prague residents[1][2].
2. Participants sang the Czechoslovak national anthem and shouted anti-Nazi slogans[2].
3. The event spread beyond Prague, with demonstrations occurring in other Czech cities as well[2].

This massive show of defiance against the Nazi occupation led to severe repercussions. On November 17, 1939, just two days after Opletal's funeral:

1. Nazi forces stormed university dormitories and arrested over 1,200 students[2][7].
2. Nine student leaders and professors were executed without trial[3][7].
3. All Czech higher education institutions were closed indefinitely[1][8].

The closure of universities and the brutal crackdown on students were direct consequences of the anti-Nazi demonstrations that occurred during and after Opletal's funeral. This event has since been commemorated as International Students' Day, serving as a reminder of the sacrifices made by Czech students in their resistance against Nazi occupation[3][8].
