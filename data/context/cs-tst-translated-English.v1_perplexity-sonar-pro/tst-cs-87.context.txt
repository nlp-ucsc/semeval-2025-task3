The author of the humorous novel Saturnin is Zdeněk Jirotka[1]. Zdeněk Jirotka was a Czech writer born on January 7, 1911 in Ostrava and died on April 12, 2003 in Prague[1][9]. 

Saturnin, Jirotka's most famous work, was first published in 1942 and has since become a classic of Czech literature[1][4]. The novel has been extremely popular in the Czech Republic, with over 15 Czech editions published since its initial release[1]. It has also been translated into multiple languages, including English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Ukrainian, and others[7].

Jirotka's writing style in Saturnin is often compared to that of P.G. Wodehouse, with its witty humor and clever wordplay[1][4]. The novel tells the story of a young man and his eccentric servant Saturnin, who turns his master's life upside down with his unconventional methods and ideas[4]. The book is known for its quintessentially Czech humor and has been adapted for radio, television, film, and stage productions[1][7].

Before becoming a full-time writer, Jirotka had a varied career. He worked as a bricklayer, graduated from a technical school, served in the Czechoslovak Army until 1940, and then worked at the Ministry of Public Works[1]. After the success of Saturnin in 1942, he devoted himself entirely to writing[9]. Throughout his career, Jirotka contributed to various newspapers and magazines, including Lidové noviny, Svobodné noviny, and the humorous journal Dikobraz[1][9].
