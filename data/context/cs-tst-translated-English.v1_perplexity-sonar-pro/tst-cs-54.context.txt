Petr Nečas resigned as Prime Minister of the Czech Republic in June 2013 due to a major corruption and spying scandal involving his chief of staff and alleged lover, Jana Nagyova[1][2]. The key details of this scandal are:

1. Police raid and arrests: A massive police raid was conducted on government offices, private villas, and a bank, resulting in the arrest of several high-ranking officials and politicians, including Jana Nagyova[1][5].

2. Charges against Nagyova: Nagyova was indicted on charges of bribery and complicity in the abuse of power[1]. Specifically, she was accused of:
   - Ordering military intelligence to spy on Nečas's estranged wife, Radka[1].
   - Offering lucrative jobs in state-run companies to three former lawmakers from Nečas's party in exchange for their resignation from parliament[5].

3. Scale of the scandal: The police raids uncovered large stashes of cash and gold, with over $6 million in cash and tens of kilograms of gold seized[5].

4. Personal implications: The scandal had a personal dimension, as Nečas had announced his divorce from his wife of 25 years just days before the scandal erupted, fueling speculation about his relationship with Nagyova[1][5].

5. Political pressure: Initially, Nečas refused to step down[8], but the mounting pressure from the scandal and its implications for his government eventually forced him to announce his resignation on June 16, 2013, which he formally tendered on June 17[1][2][7].

This scandal was described as the Czech Republic's biggest anti-corruption operation in two decades[5]. Nečas's resignation not only ended his tenure as Prime Minister but also led to his stepping down as chairman of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS)[1][2]. The scandal ultimately resulted in the collapse of his government and paved the way for early elections in the Czech Republic[2].
