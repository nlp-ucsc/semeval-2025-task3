Slavonice is located in the South Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic[1][3]. However, it's important to note some nuances about its location:

1. While administratively part of the South Bohemian Region, Slavonice actually lies in the historical land of Moravia[1].

2. It is situated very close to the Austrian border, making it the westernmost town in the historical territory of Moravia[3][4].

3. The town is about 29 kilometers (18 miles) southeast of Jindřichův Hradec and 63 km (39 miles) east of České Budějovice[1].

4. Slavonice is adjacent to the Austrian municipality of Waldkirchen an der Thaya[1].

5. The area around Slavonice is sometimes referred to as "Czech Canada" due to its rugged and beautiful landscapes[5].

6. Geographically, the eastern part of Slavonice's municipal territory lies in the Křižanov Highlands, while the western part is in the Javořice Highlands[1].

This unique location at the intersection of South Bohemia, Moravia, and Austria has contributed to Slavonice's rich history and cultural heritage, making it a town of significant historical and architectural interest[2][3].
