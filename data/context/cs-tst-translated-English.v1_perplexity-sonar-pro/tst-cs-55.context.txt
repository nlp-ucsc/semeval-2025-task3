The original Prague University, founded in 1348 by Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV, had four faculties[1][2][3]:

1. Faculty of Liberal Arts (also called Faculty of Arts or Artistic Faculty)
2. Faculty of Medicine
3. Faculty of Law
4. Faculty of Theology

These four faculties were modeled after the structure of other prominent European universities of the time, particularly the University of Paris[1][5]. The Faculty of Liberal Arts was considered the foundational faculty, where students would begin their studies before potentially moving on to the other specialized faculties[10].

The Faculty of Liberal Arts (now known as the Faculty of Arts) quickly became the largest part of the university[10]. It provided education primarily in rhetoric and philosophy, serving as a preparatory stage for students before they pursued more advanced studies in the other faculties[10].

It's worth noting that in 1372, the Faculty of Law briefly separated from the university to form its own institution. However, this separate law university only existed until 1418/19, after which it was reintegrated into Charles University[8].

Today, Charles University has expanded significantly and now comprises 17 faculties[6][7], but these four original faculties remain at the core of its academic structure and historical legacy.
