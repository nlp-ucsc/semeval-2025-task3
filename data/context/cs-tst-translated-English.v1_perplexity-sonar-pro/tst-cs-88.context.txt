Praha Masarykovo nádraží, also known as Prague Masaryk Railway Station, is the oldest train station in Prague located on Hybernská Street[1][4]. 

This historic station has several notable features:

1. It was the first railway station in Prague to serve steam trains[1].

2. The station was designed by architect Antonín Jüngling and opened for service in 1845[1][4].

3. It is considered a terminal or "impassable" railway station, meaning trains cannot pass through it[2].

4. The station building is the oldest railway station structure in Prague[2].

5. Its construction took place between 1844 and 1845 on a site between Hybernská and Jezdecká (now Havlíčkova) Streets[3].

6. The first train arrived at the station on August 20, 1845, marking the beginning of railway transportation in Prague[3][9].

Throughout its history, the station has undergone several name changes:

- 1845-1862: Simply called "Prague" or "Prag" in German
- 1862-1919: Praha státní nádraží (Prague State Station)
- 1919-1940: Praha Masarykovo nádraží (Prague Masaryk Station)

- 1953-1990: Praha střed (Prague Central)
- 1990-present: Praha Masarykovo nádraží[1]

The station is currently undergoing a significant modernization project, which began in January 2024 and is expected to be completed in 2027[9].
