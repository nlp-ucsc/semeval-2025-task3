The Czechoslovak film parody of a Western you're referring to is "Lemonade Joe" (Czech: "Limonádový Joe aneb Koňská opera"), released in 1964 and directed by Oldřich Lipský[1][2]. This musical comedy centers around the titular character, Lemonade Joe, a clean-living gunfighter who promotes the soft drink Kolaloka instead of alcohol[2].

Key details about the film:

1. Plot: The story takes place in Stetson City, Arizona, in 1885. Lemonade Joe arrives in town, promoting the non-alcoholic soft drink Kolaloka. His superior gunfighting skills and advocacy for teetotalism quickly convince the town's residents to abandon whiskey in favor of lemonade[2].

2. Main character: Lemonade Joe is portrayed as a squeaky-clean gunfighter who drinks only Kolaloka lemonade. He's played by Karel Fiala and is known for his fast shooting, which he attributes to his consumption of the soft drink[1][2].

3. Satire: The film parodies not only American Westerns but also includes satirical elements targeting American capitalism and cultural imperialism. The soft drink Kolaloka is a clear parody of Coca-Cola[2].

4. Cultural context: "Lemonade Joe" was created a few years before the Prague Spring and is considered an example of the cultural revival in Czechoslovakia at that time[1].

5. Visual style: The film is noted for its inventive and frivolous cinematography, featuring strong light-dark contrasts in various color shades, and incorporating absurd and surreal elements[1].

6. Reception: "Lemonade Joe" was a huge hit in Czechoslovakia, becoming the biggest-drawing film of the 1960s. It remains a cult classic in its home country[3].

This film stands out as a unique blend of Western parody, musical comedy, and subtle political satire, all centered around the lemonade-drinking hero and his promotion of the fictional Kolaloka soft drink.
