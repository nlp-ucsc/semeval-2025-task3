Adolf Loos is the main representative and creator of the Raumplan concept in architecture[1][2][4]. 

Adolf Loos was an Austrian-Czechoslovak architect born in 1870 in Brno, Moravia (now part of the Czech Republic)[2][6]. He is considered a pioneering modernist architect who developed the innovative spatial design concept known as Raumplan[1][4].

The Raumplan, or "spatial plan," is a method of organizing interior spaces that Loos developed and implemented in his architectural designs[1][4]. This concept involves:

1. Arranging rooms at different levels and heights based on their function and importance[1][8]
2. Creating interconnected, continuous spaces rather than traditional floor plans[1][8]
3. Designing interiors where ascent and descent between spaces is subtle and functional[1]

Loos's masterpiece demonstrating the Raumplan concept is Villa Müller in Prague, designed in 1930 for František Müller and his wife Milada[1][5]. This building showcases Loos's principles of:

- Contrast between a simple exterior and complex interior[1]
- Vertical progression from public to private spaces[1]
- Visual connections between different areas through pierced walls and diagonal views[1]

Loos explained his approach by stating, "My architecture is not conceived by drawings, but by spaces. I do not draw plans, facades or sections… For me, the ground floor, first floor do not exist… There are only interconnected continual spaces, rooms, halls, terraces…"[1]

The Raumplan concept had a significant influence on modernist architecture and continues to be studied and admired by architects and designers today[4][7].
