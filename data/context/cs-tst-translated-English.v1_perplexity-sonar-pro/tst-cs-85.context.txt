The theater founded by Jiří Šlitr, Jiří Suchý, and Ferdinand Havlík is called Semafor. It was established in Prague, Czech Republic in 1959[2][4]. 

Semafor quickly became a legendary and influential theater in Prague, particularly during its heyday in the 1960s. The name "Semafor" is actually an acronym that stands for "SEven MAlých FORem" (Seven Small Forms), referring to the various genres the theater incorporated - musical comedy, poetry theatre, song history, jazz, fine arts, film, and free genre[4].

The theater was instrumental in shaping Czech pop culture and music in the 1960s. It produced some of the biggest Czech pop hits and helped launch the careers of many prominent Czech singers and actors, including Waldemar Matuška, Eva Pilarová, and Karel Gott[2].

Jiří Šlitr and Jiří Suchý formed a well-known duo at Semafor, collaborating on numerous successful productions. Their first play for Semafor, "Člověk z půdy" (Man from Attic), was a remarkable success[1][3]. The theater became Šlitr's principal venue, where he, along with Suchý and Havlík, became key exponents of what is considered the "golden era" of Semafor[1][3].

The Semafor theater continues to operate to this day, although it has moved locations over the years. It is currently located in Prague's Dejvice district, with Jiří Suchý still involved as the owner and artistic director[2][4].
