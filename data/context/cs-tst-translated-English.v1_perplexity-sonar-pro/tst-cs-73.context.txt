The Hracholusky water structure was completed in 1964 on the Mže River near Plzeň in the Czech Republic[8][9]. 

Some key details about the Hracholusky dam and reservoir:

- It was constructed between 1959-1964[7].
- The dam was designed by the company Hydroprojekt[8].
- It is located approximately 10 km upstream from its current profile on the Mže River[7].
- The Mže River is the largest of Plzeň's rivers by water volume[9].
- While many view it as a recreational area today, the primary purpose of the dam was for water management[8].

The Hracholusky Reservoir created by the dam serves multiple functions, including flood control, water supply, and hydroelectric power generation. It has also become an important recreational area for the region around Plzeň in western Bohemia.
