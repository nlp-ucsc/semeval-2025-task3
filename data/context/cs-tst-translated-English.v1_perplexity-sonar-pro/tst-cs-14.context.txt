Jim Čert is primarily known as an accordion player[1]. He is a Czech musician who became famous for his performances in Prague's underground taverns, combining his accordion playing with gruff vocals and a mix of folk traditionals, contemporary Czech poetry, and adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's poems[1].

Čert's style is characterized by his accordion accompaniment, which he plays while singing and even drinking beer during performances[1]. His unique approach blends Slavic melancholia with provocative elements, creating a distinctive sound that made him a notable figure in the Czech music scene.

The accordion is central to Čert's musical identity, allowing him to create a rich, folk-inspired sound that complements his vocal style. This instrument choice aligns well with the tavern settings where he often performed, as the accordion is portable and well-suited to intimate, acoustic performances.

It's worth noting that while the accordion is his primary instrument, musicians often play multiple instruments. However, based on the available search results, the accordion is consistently mentioned as Jim Čert's main instrument of choice[1][2].
