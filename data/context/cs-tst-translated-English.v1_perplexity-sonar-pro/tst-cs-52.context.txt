Emil Hácha served as the State President of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia throughout its existence from March 16, 1939 to May 9, 1945[1][4]. 

Hácha had previously been elected as President of Czechoslovakia on November 30, 1938, following the Munich Agreement and the abdication of Edvard Beneš[4]. When Nazi Germany invaded and occupied the Czech lands on March 15, 1939, Hácha was pressured into accepting German "protection" over Bohemia and Moravia[4]. The next day, on March 16, Hitler declared the establishment of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, with Hácha becoming its State President[4].

As State President, Hácha held a largely ceremonial role with very limited powers, while real authority rested with the German Reich Protector[2]. Hácha found himself in a difficult position, initially attempting to resist some German policies but ultimately being forced to collaborate to some degree[4]. He remained in this position until the end of World War II and the dissolution of the Protectorate in May 1945[1][4].

It's important to note that while Hácha was the nominal Czech leader, the Protectorate was effectively controlled by Nazi Germany through the office of the Reich Protector. The Reich Protectors during this period were:

1. Konstantin von Neurath (March 1939 - September 1941)
2. Reinhard Heydrich (Acting, September 1941 - June 1942)
3. Kurt Daluege (Acting, June 1942 - August 1943)
4. Wilhelm Frick (August 1943 - May 1945)[1][3]

These Reich Protectors, particularly Heydrich, wielded the real executive power in the Protectorate[2][3].
