Based on the search results provided, there is no specific mention of a Czech chemist, entrepreneur, and industrialist who was at the origin of a Czech company for the production and sale of gasoline. The search results do not contain information directly relevant to this query.

However, I can provide some related information about notable Czech chemists and industrialists from the search results:

1. Emil Kolben was a significant Czech industrialist and engineer who founded one of Czechoslovakia's biggest heavy engineering plants in the early 20th century[3]. While not directly involved in gasoline production, he was an important figure in Czech industry.

2. Otto Wichterle was a famous Czech chemist known for inventing soft contact lenses[7][10]. He was not involved in the gasoline industry, but he is a notable figure in Czech chemistry.

3. The search results mention BENZINA, spol. s r.o., which is part of the UNIPETROL Group and operates the largest network of petrol stations in the Czech Republic[8]. However, the founder of this company is not specified in the provided information.

4. Česká rafinérská a.s. was mentioned as the largest Czech oil refining company[5], but again, no specific founder is named in the search results.

If you're looking for information about a specific person involved in the early Czech gasoline industry, I'm afraid the provided search results don't contain that information. You may need to conduct a more targeted search or consult additional sources for this specific query.
