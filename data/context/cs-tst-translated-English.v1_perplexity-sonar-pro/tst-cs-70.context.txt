Wenceslas II, the future King of Bohemia, was imprisoned at Bezděz Castle in the Česká Lípa region in the 13th century[1][3][7].

Bezděz Castle, located in the Liberec Region of the Czech Republic, was constructed in 1264 by order of King Přemysl Otakar II[2]. The castle gained notoriety in medieval times as the place where the young Wenceslas II was held captive along with his mother, Queen Kunhuta[1][3].

This imprisonment occurred in 1278, shortly after the death of Wenceslas II's father, Ottokar II[3]. At the time, Wenceslas was only 6 or 7 years old[3]. The castle, which was still unfinished, became their prison under the orders of Ota Braniborský (Otto of Brandenburg), who was serving as Wenceslas's guardian[3].

The conditions of their confinement were reportedly quite harsh[3]. Queen Kunhuta eventually managed to escape, leaving the young Wenceslas alone in the castle[3]. This experience is believed to have had a significant impact on the future king[3].

Later in life, when Wenceslas II became the ruling monarch, he returned to Bezděz Castle and ordered the construction of a chapel, which remains one of the best-preserved areas of the castle to this day[3]. This act suggests that despite the difficult memories associated with the place, Wenceslas II maintained a connection to Bezděz throughout his life.

The imprisonment of the young Wenceslas II at Bezděz Castle has become an important part of Czech history and contributes to the castle's historical significance[9].
