I apologize, but there appears to be an error in your question. Based on the search results provided, no document was jointly signed by Václav Klaus and Vladimír Mečiar on July 8, 1992 at the Tugendhat villa. 

However, an important meeting and agreement did take place at Villa Tugendhat, but on a different date. According to the search results:

The agreement to divide Czechoslovakia was signed at Villa Tugendhat by Czech Prime Minister Václav Klaus and Slovak Prime Minister Vladimír Mečiar on August 26, 1992[1][2][6]. This meeting is sometimes referred to as the "meeting under the tree" that took place in the garden of Villa Tugendhat[6].

At this meeting, Klaus and Mečiar agreed to dissolve the common state of Czechoslovakia[3]. This agreement led to the peaceful division of Czechoslovakia into two independent states - the Czech Republic and Slovakia - which took effect on January 1, 1993[1][3].

The Villa Tugendhat, located in Brno, was chosen partly for its symbolic location approximately halfway between Prague and Bratislava[1]. At the time, it was a government building[1].

This event is often referred to as the "Velvet Divorce," echoing the peaceful nature of the earlier "Velvet Revolution" that had ended communist rule in Czechoslovakia[3].

It's worth noting that this agreement came after a series of negotiations and political developments throughout 1992, including the Slovak Parliament's adoption of the Declaration of Independence of the Slovak Nation on July 17, 1992[3][8].
