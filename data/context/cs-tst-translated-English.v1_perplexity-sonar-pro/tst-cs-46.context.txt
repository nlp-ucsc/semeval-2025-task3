I apologize, but I do not have enough specific information in the provided search results to definitively state which building housed the Czech Provincial Assembly after 1861. The search results do not contain details about the exact location or building used by the Czech Provincial Assembly during that time period.

The search results provide some general historical context about Czech parliamentary history, but do not mention a specific building used after 1861. Without more precise information, I cannot confidently answer where the Czech Provincial Assembly was housed at that time.

If you need this specific information, it would be best to consult additional historical sources focused on Czech parliamentary buildings and locations in the mid-19th century. Local historical archives or records from Prague may have more details about the exact premises used by the assembly during that era.
