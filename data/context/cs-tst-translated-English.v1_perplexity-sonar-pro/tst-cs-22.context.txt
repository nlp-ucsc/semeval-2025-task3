The period in Czechoslovakia from the end of World War II in 1945 to the Communist takeover in February 1948 is often referred to as the "Third Republic" or "Limited Democracy" period.

This brief era was characterized by several key features:

1. Restoration of Czechoslovakia: After World War II, Czechoslovakia was reestablished under its pre-1938 borders, except for Carpathian Ruthenia, which became part of the Ukrainian SSR[4].

2. Multi-party system: The country maintained a semblance of democratic governance with multiple political parties, though the Communist Party already held significant influence[2].

3. Transitional government: A coalition government was formed, which included communist ministers in key positions such as prime minister and minister of interior[4].

4. Soviet influence: The Soviet Union, having played a major role in liberating most of Czechoslovakia, exerted considerable influence over the country's affairs[2].

5. Economic changes: This period saw the implementation of significant economic reforms, including nationalization of industries and agricultural reform[2].

6. Geopolitical positioning: Czechoslovakia found itself increasingly within the Soviet "sphere of influence" as agreed upon by the Allied powers at the Yalta Conference[2].

7. Growing communist power: The Communist Party steadily increased its power and public support during this time, setting the stage for its eventual takeover[2].

This period ended with the events of February 1948, when the Communist Party, led by Klement Gottwald, seized full control of the government in what they termed "Victorious February"[2][5]. This marked the beginning of four decades of communist rule in Czechoslovakia.
