Pernštejn Castle exhibits a blend of Gothic and Renaissance architectural styles, with its primary form reflecting late Gothic design while incorporating significant Renaissance elements[1][2][4].

The castle's architectural evolution can be summarized as follows:

1. Gothic origins: The castle was originally built in the Gothic style in the 13th century, with its oldest core dating back to between 1270 and 1285[2].

2. Late Gothic expansion: Major expansions and renovations occurred in the late Gothic period, particularly during the 15th and early 16th centuries. This phase significantly shaped the castle's current appearance[1][2].

3. Renaissance additions: During the 16th century, Renaissance elements were incorporated into the castle's architecture, especially in the interior spaces and decorative features[1][4].

Key architectural features include:

- Gothic elements:
  - The Barborka Tower, a round five-storied tower with an edge turned toward the driveway[1]
  - Diamond vault in the entrance space[1]
  - Fortification systems, including walls, towers, and moats[1]

- Renaissance elements:
  - Spatial concept of new halls added in the 16th century[1]
  - Stonework on window reveals and portals[1]
  - Marble portals and rectangular doorways[4]
  - Renaissance cross vaults in some rooms, such as the library[1]

The castle's unique architectural character stems from its transformation from a medieval fortress into a Renaissance palace while maintaining its defensive capabilities[2]. This blend of styles makes Pernštejn Castle a remarkable example of the transition between Gothic and Renaissance architecture in Central Europe.
