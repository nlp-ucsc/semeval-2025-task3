Miloš Zeman, the former President of the Czech Republic, is strongly associated with the town of Nové Veselí in the Vysočina region. Here are the key details about this association:

1. Zeman co-owns real estate in Nové Veselí, which he uses as a vacation home[4].

2. He has made it a tradition to spend his annual summer holidays in Nové Veselí. During these vacations, Zeman engages in various activities:

   - He enjoys rides in his favorite yellow-blue inflatable raft on the local pond[4][7].
   - He visits the spring of the Oslava River, which is located near the town[4].
   - In the past, he would regularly meet friends at the spring and participate in tourist marches organized by the local branch of the Sokol sports organization[4].

3. Zeman has shown interest in local affairs. For instance, he praised the reconstruction efforts of Nové Veselí's mayor, Zdenek Krivanek, after vandals damaged the tourist point at the Oslava River spring[4].

4. After his election as President in 2013, Zeman chose to retire to his home in Nové Veselí to rest before taking office[5][6].

5. The town seems to hold a special place for Zeman, as he has consistently returned there for holidays, even while serving as the President of the Czech Republic[4].

This connection between Miloš Zeman and Nové Veselí appears to be long-standing and personal, with the town serving as a retreat and a place of relaxation for the former Czech President.
