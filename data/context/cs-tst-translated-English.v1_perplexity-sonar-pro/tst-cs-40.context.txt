The girl who was allegedly murdered by Leopold Hilsner in Polná was Anežka Hrůzová[1][4]. She was a 19-year-old Czech Catholic girl who worked as a seamstress in Polná[1][2]. On March 29, 1899, Anežka Hrůzová left her place of employment but did not return home[1]. Her body was discovered three days later on April 1, 1899, in a forest near Polná[1][2]. She was found with her throat slit and her garments torn[1]. This murder led to the infamous Hilsner Affair, a series of antisemitic trials in which Leopold Hilsner was accused of murdering Anežka Hrůzová and using her blood for Jewish rituals[2].
