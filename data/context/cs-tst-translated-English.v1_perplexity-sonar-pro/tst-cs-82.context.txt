Rudé právo was the official newspaper of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia[1][2]. Founded in 1920, it served as the primary mouthpiece for communist ideology and propaganda in Czechoslovakia for much of the 20th century[1][7].

Key aspects of Rudé právo include:

1. Name and meaning: The name Rudé právo translates to "Red Justice" or "The Red Right" in Czech[1].

2. Political affiliation: It was directly controlled by and represented the views of the ruling Communist Party[1][4].

3. Circulation and readership: Rudé právo had a daily circulation of over one million, though this was largely due to its status as the official newspaper rather than genuine popularity[4].

4. Content and ideology: The newspaper's content was heavily ideological and propagandistic, closely adhering to the Communist Party line[2][4]. It often featured full speeches by Czechoslovak and Soviet leaders, and used communist terminology like "comrade" (soudruh) frequently[3].

5. Historical significance: Rudé právo played a crucial role in information control and dissemination during the communist era in Czechoslovakia[4].

6. Format and structure: The newspaper was printed in a large format (42 cm x 58.5 cm) and typically featured domestic news on the front pages, followed by international news and reader letters[3].

7. Post-communist era: Following the Velvet Revolution in 1989, Rudé právo was privatized, and some of its editors founded a new, unaffiliated daily called Právo[1].

Throughout its history, Rudé právo served as the Czechoslovak equivalent of the Soviet Union's Pravda, acting as the primary vehicle for official communist messaging and state-controlled information in the country[1][4].
