I apologize, but I don't have any information about a series called "The Chef's Dilemma" or who played the main role in it. The search results don't provide any details about a TV series or film with that specific title. 

The closest reference is a YouTube video titled "The Chef's Dilemma: Understanding Why People Leave Jobs", but this appears to be a podcast episode rather than a scripted series with actors[7]. There's also mention of "The Chef's Dilemma" in the context of a TikTok video about leaving a voicemail for a vegetable supplier[5], but again this doesn't seem to be referring to a TV series or film.

Without more specific information about the series you're asking about, I can't provide details on who played the main role. If you have any additional context about this series, such as when it aired, what network it was on, or any other details, I'd be happy to try searching for more information.
