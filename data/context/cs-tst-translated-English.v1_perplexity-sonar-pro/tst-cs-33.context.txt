Náměstí Míru is the deepest station of the Prague Metro[1][2][4][5]. It is located 53 meters underground[1][5], making it not only the deepest station in Prague but also one of the deepest in the European Union[4][5].

Some key details about Náměstí Míru station:

1. Depth: The platform is situated 53 meters below the surface[1][5].

2. Escalators: It features the longest escalators in the European Union[4][5]. These escalators are:
   - 87 meters long
   - Have a vertical span of 43.5 meters
   - Contain 533 steps
   - Take about 2 minutes and 15-21 seconds to ascend (slight variations in reported times)[4][5]

3. Location: The station is located in the Vinohrady district, under Korunní Street[5].

4. Significance: It's part of Line A (the green line) of the Prague Metro[5].

5. Opening: The station opened on August 12, 1978, as part of the first section of Line A[5].

6. Future plans: Náměstí Míru is intended to be part of the new Line D in the future, though the new station will be built closer to the surface[5].

It's worth noting that while Náměstí Míru is the deepest station, it's not the deepest point in the entire Prague Metro network. The deepest point is actually in the tunnel between Hradčanská and Malostranská stations, which reaches 68 meters below the surface[5].

The station's depth and long escalators make it a notable feature of Prague's metro system and a point of interest for both locals and tourists.
