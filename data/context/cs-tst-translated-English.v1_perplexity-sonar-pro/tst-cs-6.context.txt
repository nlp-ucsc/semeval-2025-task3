According to legend, St. Wenceslaus was murdered by his younger brother Boleslav (also spelled Boleslaus) and his conspirators[1][3][4][5]. The murder took place on September 28, most likely in the year 935, though some sources mention 929 as a possible alternative date[1][2][4].

The events leading to the assassination are described as follows:

1. Boleslav invited Wenceslaus to his residence in Stará Boleslav under the pretext of celebrating the feast of Saints Cosmas and Damian[1][2][4].

2. On the morning after the feast, as Wenceslaus was on his way to attend morning mass, he encountered Boleslav near the church door[1][4].

3. An argument ensued between the brothers, during which Boleslav struck Wenceslaus on the head with his sword, causing only a minor injury[1][4].

4. Wenceslaus, not wanting to harm his brother, did not defend himself[2][4].

5. At this point, three of Boleslav's companions - named in some accounts as Tira, Česta, and Hněvsa - attacked and stabbed Wenceslaus[3][5][7].

6. Finally, Boleslav himself delivered the fatal blow, running Wenceslaus through with a lance[3][6][7].

Some accounts mention that Wenceslaus's last words were "May God forgive you, brother"[6][8], highlighting his piety even in his final moments. The murder of Wenceslaus is considered a significant turning point in early Bohemian history, as it led to Boleslav's ascension to power and subsequent changes in the region's political landscape[3].
