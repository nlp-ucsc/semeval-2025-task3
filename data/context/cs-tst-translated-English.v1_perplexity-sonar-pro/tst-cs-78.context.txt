Emil Škoda was the founder of the engineering company Škoda Works, which later became the predecessor of today's Škoda Auto and Škoda Transportation[1][3].

Emil Ritter von Škoda was born on November 19, 1839, in Plzeň (Pilsen), Bohemia, which was then part of the Austrian Empire[1][3]. He was a Czech engineer and industrialist who played a significant role in establishing one of Europe's largest industrial complexes[3].

After studying engineering in Germany, Škoda's career in the industrial sector began when he became the chief engineer of a small machine factory in Plzeň. Three years later, he purchased this factory and rapidly expanded it[3]. His entrepreneurial spirit and technical expertise led to significant growth and diversification of the company:

1. In 1886, he built his own railway connection to the main Vienna–Cheb line, improving logistics for the company[3].
2. In 1890, he added an arms factory to produce a newly invented machine gun for the Austrian Army, marking the company's entry into arms manufacturing[3].
3. By 1899, Škoda had incorporated his growing collection of machine shops, forges, and tool-and-die shops in Plzeň as the Škoda Works[3][9].

Under Škoda's leadership, the company expanded rapidly. By the late 19th century, Škoda Works employed around 4,000 workers and 200 technicians[9]. The company became known for its steel production, with a steel mill that grew to be one of the most prominent in Europe[9].

Škoda's innovations and business acumen led to the Škoda Works becoming the largest industrial enterprise in Austria-Hungary[9]. The company's success continued after Škoda's death in 1900, and it played a significant role in arms production during both World Wars[3][5].

It's worth noting that while Emil Škoda founded the engineering company Škoda Works, the automotive branch of Škoda has a separate origin. The car company began as Laurin & Klement in 1895, founded by Václav Laurin and Václav Klement[2][4]. This bicycle and motorcycle company later merged with Škoda Works in 1925, several years after Emil Škoda's death, to become the automotive manufacturer known as Škoda Auto[2][6].
