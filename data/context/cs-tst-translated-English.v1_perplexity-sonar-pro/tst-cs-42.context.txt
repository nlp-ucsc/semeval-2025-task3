The church in Kutná Hora is dedicated to Saint Barbara, the patron saint of miners[1][2][4]. This dedication is particularly fitting given Kutná Hora's history as a prosperous silver mining town[3][4].

The church, officially named Saint Barbara's Church (Czech: Chrám svaté Barbory), is a Roman Catholic church built in the Gothic style[2]. It is sometimes referred to as the Cathedral of St. Barbara, although it is not technically a cathedral[2][5].

Construction of the church began in 1388 as a project initiated and funded by the local mining community[1][4]. The miners chose Saint Barbara as the church's patron due to her role as a protector of those in dangerous professions, especially mining[4][5]. 

The church's construction and decoration reflect its dedication to Saint Barbara and the town's mining heritage:

1. Frescoes and stained glass windows depict scenes of mining life and the town's history[1][3][4].
2. Statues of miners in their work attire can be found inside the church[4].
3. Mining motifs are incorporated into various decorative elements throughout the structure[3].

Saint Barbara's Church is not only a place of worship but also a testament to the wealth and importance of Kutná Hora during its silver mining heyday. It is now recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, celebrated for its outstanding Gothic architecture and historical significance[2][5][7].
