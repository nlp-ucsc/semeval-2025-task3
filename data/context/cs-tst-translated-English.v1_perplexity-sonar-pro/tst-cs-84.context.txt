The Battle of White Mountain took place on November 8, 1620[1][3][5]. This battle was a significant event in the early stages of the Thirty Years' War, fought near Prague in Bohemia (now part of the Czech Republic)[1][3]. It marked a decisive victory for the Catholic forces of the Holy Roman Empire and the Catholic League over the Protestant forces of the Bohemian Revolt[1][2].

The battle lasted only about an hour but had far-reaching consequences[1][3]:

1. It led to the defeat of the Bohemian Revolt.
2. It ensured Habsburg control over Bohemia for the next three hundred years.
3. It resulted in the flight of Frederick V, the newly elected Protestant king of Bohemia, earning him the nickname "the Winter King" for his brief reign[1][5].
4. In the aftermath, 27 leaders of the insurrection were executed in Prague's Old Town Square[1].
5. It initiated a harsh re-Catholicization process in Bohemia, with many Protestant nobles forced into exile and their properties confiscated[1][3].

The Battle of White Mountain is considered one of the most important battles of the Thirty Years' War, as it had lasting political and religious implications for the region[7].
