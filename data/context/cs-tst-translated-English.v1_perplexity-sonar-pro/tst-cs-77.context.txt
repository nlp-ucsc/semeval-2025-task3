Radůza is the stage name of Radka Urbanová (née Vranková), a renowned Czech singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist[3][4]. Born on March 16, 1973, Radůza has become one of the most popular Czech folk singers, known for her raw and deep voice that is full of life and energy[1][3].

Radůza's musical journey began as a young girl busking with a guitar on the streets of Prague[1]. Her talent was discovered in 1993 by another great Czech folk singer, Zuzana Navarová, which led to her introduction to a wider public[2]. This discovery marked the beginning of her professional career in music.

As an artist, Radůza is not only known for her distinctive voice but also for her skills as an accordionist and multi-instrumentalist[3][4]. Her music is deeply rooted in Czech folk traditions, influenced by the songs her grandfather sang to her during her childhood[1]. However, her style has evolved over time, incorporating various influences and languages into her work.

Radůza's contributions to Czech music have been widely recognized. She won three awards at the 2003 Anděl Awards, a prestigious Czech music award ceremony[3][5]. Her popularity extends beyond the Czech Republic, with performances in various European countries, including Poland, France, and Germany[1].

Throughout her career, Radůza has released multiple albums and continues to captivate audiences with her unique blend of folk music and poetic lyrics. Her approach to songwriting is intuitive, often describing herself as a medium through which the songs come, rather than a deliberate composer[1]. This organic approach to music creation has contributed to her authentic and evolving sound over the years.
