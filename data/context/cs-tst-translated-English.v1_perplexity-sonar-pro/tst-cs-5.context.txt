The Elbe River originates in the Krkono≈°e Mountains (also known as the Giant Mountains) in the northern Czech Republic[1][2][4]. Specifically, its source is located in an area called the Elbe Meadow, situated at an altitude of 1,386 meters (4,547 feet) above sea level[1][2][6].

The exact source of the Elbe is composed of several small streams that come together to form the river's headwaters. While there is a symbolic structure marking the source on the Elbe Meadow, the true source is actually located slightly higher up in the mountains[6].

Near the source, you can find a stone wall displaying the coats of arms of 26 towns and cities through which the Elbe flows on its journey[1][6]. This serves as a testament to the river's importance to the regions it traverses.

From its source, the Elbe begins its long journey, flowing first through the Czech Republic before entering Germany and ultimately emptying into the North Sea near Cuxhaven, Germany[2][4]. The river's total length is approximately 1,094 kilometers (680 miles)[2], making it one of the major rivers of Central Europe.

It's worth noting that the last few meters leading up to the actual source are not accessible by bike and can only be reached on foot, adding a sense of remoteness and natural beauty to the river's origins[1].
