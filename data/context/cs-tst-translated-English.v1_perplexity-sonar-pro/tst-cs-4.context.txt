The composition in Bedřich Smetana's cycle "Má vlast" dedicated to a river is "Vltava," also known as "The Moldau"[1][5]. This symphonic poem, which is the second movement of the six-part suite, portrays the journey of the Vltava River (called Moldau in German) through the Czech countryside[1].

"Vltava" traces the course of the river from its source in the mountains of the Bohemian Forest, through various scenes of Czech rural life, and finally to the city of Prague[1][2]. The composition musically depicts:

1. The river's origins as two small springs (represented by flutes and clarinets)[3]
2. The merging of these streams into the mighty Vltava River (portrayed by a memorable melody in the strings)[3]
3. Scenes along the river's course, including:
   - Forests with hunting sounds (brass fanfares)[3]
   - A rustic wedding celebration (polka rhythms)[1][3]
   - Moonlit revels of water nymphs[1][3]
   - The river passing ancient castles and fortresses[1][3]

4. The river's journey through the St. John's Rapids[1][3]
5. The river's arrival in Prague, where it flows past the Vyšehrad castle[1][3]

Composed in 1874, "Vltava" is the most famous and frequently performed piece from the "Má vlast" cycle[3][5]. It beautifully captures Smetana's love for his homeland through vivid musical imagery of the Czech landscape and its most prominent river[1][2].
