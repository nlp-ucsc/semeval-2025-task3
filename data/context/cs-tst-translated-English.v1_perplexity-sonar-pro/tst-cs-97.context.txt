The city of Chomutov was conquered by the Hussites in the 15th century, specifically in 1421[1][7]. This event occurred during the Hussite Wars, a series of conflicts that took place between 1419 and 1434[4].

The conquest of Chomutov was part of a larger campaign by the Hussites to expand their control over Bohemia. In March 1421, the Hussites besieged Chomutov, which at the time was a well-fortified town garrisoned by forces loyal to the Catholic side[1]. The siege lasted for three days, after which the Hussites successfully captured the town[2].

The conquest of Chomutov was particularly notable for its brutality. Following their victory, the Hussites, seeking retribution for earlier atrocities committed against them, carried out a massacre of the town's population. They killed every male citizen, including those who pledged to accept Hussite practices. The Jewish population of the town was offered amnesty if they would convert to the Hussite creed, but they refused and were also killed[1].

This event was part of a series of conquests and battles that marked the Hussite Wars, during which the Hussite forces, led by figures such as Jan Žižka, successfully resisted several crusades launched against them and expanded their control over much of Bohemia[3][5].

It's worth noting that prior to its conquest by the Hussites, Chomutov had been a command post of the Teutonic Knights in the 14th century[9]. The Hussite conquest in 1421 thus represented a significant shift in the town's history and control.
