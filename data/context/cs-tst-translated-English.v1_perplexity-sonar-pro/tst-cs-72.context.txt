The group of painters founded in 1918 that included Josef Čapek, Václav Špála, and Jan Zrzavý was called Tvrdošíjní (The Stubborn Ones)[1][6].

Tvrdošíjní was an important artistic group in the Czech avant-garde scene of the early 20th century. Some key details about this group include:

1. Founding: It was established in 1918, shortly after the formation of Czechoslovakia as an independent state[6].

2. Notable members: In addition to Josef Čapek, Václav Špála, and Jan Zrzavý, the group also included artists like Vlastislav Hofman, Rudolf Kremlička, and Otakar Marvánek[3].

3. Artistic approach: The group did not adhere to a strict unified program. Their works showed a blend of fading Cubist influences, tendencies towards naïve primitivism, and neo-classicism[6].

4. Philosophy: Tvrdošíjní was guided by a desire for a happy life and simple things, which was reflected in their artistic output[6].

5. Exhibitions: The group held several exhibitions, with their third exhibition in 1921 being particularly notable. It featured not only works by core members but also included guest artists from abroad such as Otto Dix, Lasar Segall, and Paul Klee[3].

6. Significance: Tvrdošíjní represented an important phase in Czech modern art, bridging the gap between earlier Cubist experiments and later avant-garde movements in the newly independent Czechoslovakia[4][6].

This group played a crucial role in shaping the rich and diverse art scene of interwar Czechoslovakia, contributing to the country's cultural flourishing in the 1920s and 1930s.
