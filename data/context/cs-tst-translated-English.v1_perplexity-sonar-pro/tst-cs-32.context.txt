The Czech noblewoman who was the wife of Archduke Franz Ferdinand d'Este, the assassinated heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was Sophie Chotek, also known as Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg[6][9].

Sophie was born on March 1, 1868, in Stuttgart, Germany[3][6]. Her full name was Sophie Marie Josephine Albina Gräfin Chotek von Chotkow und Wognin in German, or Žofie Marie Josefína Albína hraběnka Chotková z Chotkova a Vojnína in Czech[6]. She came from a Bohemian aristocratic family, the House of Chotek, though they were considered part of the lesser nobility[9].

Franz Ferdinand and Sophie met at a ball in Prague in 1894 and fell deeply in love[2][10]. However, their relationship faced significant obstacles due to Sophie's lower social status. The Habsburg family laws required that members of the imperial family marry equals, and Sophie did not meet this criterion[7][9].

Despite strong opposition from Emperor Franz Joseph I and the imperial court, Franz Ferdinand persisted in his desire to marry Sophie. Finally, in 1900, the Emperor consented to their marriage, but only under the condition that it would be a morganatic union[7][9]. This meant that Sophie could not share her husband's rank, title, or privileges, and their children would be excluded from succession to the throne[7].

Franz Ferdinand and Sophie were married on July 1, 1900, in a small ceremony at Zákupy Castle in northern Bohemia[10]. Throughout their marriage, Sophie faced numerous social restrictions and protocol-related difficulties due to her lower status[9].

Tragically, on June 28, 1914, Sophie and Franz Ferdinand were assassinated in Sarajevo, an event that triggered the chain of events leading to World War I[6][9].
