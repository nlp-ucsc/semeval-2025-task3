Petřín is a prominent hill located in the center of Prague, Czech Republic. Rising 327 meters above sea level and approximately 130 meters above the left bank of the Vltava River, it is a significant landmark and popular recreational area for both locals and tourists[1][3].

Key features of Petřín include:

1. Petřín Lookout Tower: Built in 1891, this 58.70-meter-tall steel-framework tower strongly resembles the Eiffel Tower. It offers magnificent views over Prague and, on clear days, visibility up to 150 km away[3].

2. Landscaped Gardens: The hill is almost entirely covered with parks and gardens, including the Rose Garden, Kinský Garden, and several others, making it a favorite spot for relaxation and picnics[1][2].

3. Historical Significance: The hill has been important since ancient times, with stones quarried here used to construct many historical buildings in Prague[1].

4. Hunger Wall: A medieval defense wall commissioned by Charles IV in 1360-1362, which runs down one side of the hill[1][3].

5. Other Attractions:
   - Mirror Maze
   - Štefánik Observatory
   - St. Lawrence Cathedral
   - St. Michael the Archangel Church
   - Memorial to the Victims of Communism[1][3]

6. Funicular Railway: A popular way to ascend the hill, connecting Petřín to Prague's Malá Strana district (currently closed for renovation until 2026)[1][3].

Petřín is not only a natural oasis but also a cultural and historical site, featuring in literature such as Franz Kafka's short story "Description of a Struggle" and Milan Kundera's novel "The Unbearable Lightness of Being"[1]. It offers a unique combination of recreational activities, historical exploration, and panoramic views of Prague, making it a must-visit destination for many visitors to the city.
