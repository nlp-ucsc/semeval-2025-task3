Jozef Gabčík and Jan Kubiš's attack was aimed at Reinhard Heydrich, a high-ranking Nazi official[1][3]. Specifically:

Reinhard Heydrich was the target of Operation Anthropoid, which was the codename for the assassination attempt carried out by Gabčík and Kubiš[1]. Heydrich held several important positions in Nazi Germany:

1. He was the chief of the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA)[1].
2. He was the acting governor (Reichsprotektor) of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia[1][3].
3. He was considered a principal architect of the Holocaust[1].

The assassination attempt took place on May 27, 1942, in Prague[1][2]. Gabčík and Kubiš, along with other resistance operatives, ambushed Heydrich's car as it slowed down at a sharp turn in the Libeň district of Prague[6]. Although their initial plan to shoot Heydrich failed when Gabčík's gun jammed, Kubiš managed to throw a modified anti-tank grenade at Heydrich's car[1]. 

Heydrich was severely wounded in the attack and died of his injuries on June 4, 1942, about a week after the assassination attempt[2][3]. This operation was significant as it was the only successful government-sponsored assassination of a senior Nazi leader during World War II[1].
