The nature reserve Divoká Šárka was named after a legendary Czech female warrior named Šárka, who features prominently in the ancient Bohemian legend known as "The Maidens' War"[2][3][4]. This legend is part of Czech folklore and is said to have taken place sometime in the 6th or 7th century, before the city of Prague existed[7].

According to the legend, Šárka was a lieutenant in an army of women led by Vlasta, who rebelled against male rule after the death of Queen Libuše[2]. The story goes that Šárka played a crucial role in this war by using her cunning to defeat a group of men led by a warrior named Ctirad[1][2].

The legend describes how Šárka tricked Ctirad and his men:

1. She tied herself to a tree and pretended to be a captive of the rebel maidens.
2. When Ctirad found her, she convinced him to free her and offered him and his men mead as thanks.
3. Unbeknownst to the men, the mead contained a sleeping potion.
4. Once the men fell asleep, Šárka blew a horn to signal her fellow female warriors, who then emerged and slaughtered the men[2][5].

The valley where this legendary event supposedly took place is now called Divoká Šárka, which translates to "Wild Šárka"[2][3]. Some versions of the legend claim that after these events, Šárka, overcome with guilt or to avoid being ruled by men, threw herself to her death from the cliffs in the area[3][4].

This dramatic tale has become an integral part of Czech culture and is often recounted to children from an early age[7]. The legend has inspired various artistic works, including operas, and has been used to promote Czech folklore and heritage[7]. Today, the Divoká Šárka nature reserve, named after this legendary figure, is a popular destination for hiking, cycling, and outdoor activities for Prague residents and visitors alike[3][6].
