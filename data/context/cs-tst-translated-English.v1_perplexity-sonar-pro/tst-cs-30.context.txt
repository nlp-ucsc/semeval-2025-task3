Edvard Beneš's Czechoslovak government-in-exile was based in London and later in the English countryside during the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia. Here are the key details:

Initially, Beneš went into exile in Putney, London in October 1938 after resigning as president of Czechoslovakia following the Munich Agreement[4]. In October 1939, he organized the Czechoslovak National Liberation Committee in London, which declared itself the Provisional Government of Czechoslovakia[4].

As the German bombing of London intensified during the Blitz in 1940, Beneš and his government relocated outside the city:

1. In November 1940, Beneš, his wife, and household staff moved to The Abbey at Aston Abbotts, near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, about 56 kilometers northwest of London[1][4].

2. His private office staff moved to the Old Manor House in the neighboring village of Wingrave[4].

3. The military intelligence staff was stationed in the nearby village of Addington[4].

The move to Aston Abbotts provided relative safety from the London Blitz while still allowing Beneš to travel to London for meetings and diplomatic work[2][4]. The Czechoslovak government-in-exile operated from these locations in Buckinghamshire for much of the war.

Beneš and his government remained based in England until 1945. After Germany's surrender, Beneš left London on May 11, 1945, traveling via Moscow, and returned to Prague on May 16, 1945, where he was greeted as a hero by crowds of people[1][9].

Throughout their time in exile, Beneš and his government worked to gain international recognition, plan for post-war Czechoslovakia, and support resistance efforts against the Nazi occupation[2][4]. Their presence left a lasting impression on the local communities in Buckinghamshire, which was commemorated decades later[10].
