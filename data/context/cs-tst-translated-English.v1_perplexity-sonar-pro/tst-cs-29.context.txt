I apologize, but I don't have enough information in the provided search results to accurately answer the question about a Czech skibobbing athlete with twelve world championship titles. The search results primarily focus on other Czech winter sports athletes like Ester Ledecká (snowboarding and alpine skiing) and Tereza Kmochová (alpine skiing), but do not contain any information about skibobbing champions. To provide an accurate answer, I would need additional sources specifically related to Czech skibobbing athletes and their world championship achievements.
