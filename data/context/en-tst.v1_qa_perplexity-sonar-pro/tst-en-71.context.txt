The provided answer contains some inaccuracies. Here is the correct information:

Norway did win the 2016 European Women's Handball Championship, securing their seventh title in this competition[1]. However, they defeated the Netherlands in the final match, not France. The final score was 30-29 in favor of Norway[1][4].

France actually played in the bronze medal match, where they defeated Denmark 25-22 to secure third place[1].

It's worth noting that while Norway is indeed the most successful team in the history of the European Women's Handball Championship, at the time of the 2016 tournament, this was their seventh title, not their ninth[4]. As of 2024, Norway has won the championship 10 times, further solidifying their dominance in this competition[5].
