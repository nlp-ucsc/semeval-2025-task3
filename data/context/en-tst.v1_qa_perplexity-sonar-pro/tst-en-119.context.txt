The provided answer contains several inaccuracies. Here's the correct information:

Aukštojas Hill, the highest point in Lithuania, has an elevation of 293.84 meters (964.0 feet) above sea level[1][2][3]. This elevation was measured in 2004 using GPS technology by specialists from the Institute of Geodesy at Vilnius Gediminas Technical University[1][2].

Regarding the location, Aukštojas Hill is not in the district of Šiauliai or Klaipėda County. It is actually located in the Medininkai Highlands, approximately 24 kilometers (15 miles) southeast of Vilnius, the capital city of Lithuania[1][2][5]. The hill is situated in Vilnius Region, specifically in the Juozapinė Geomorphological Reserve near Medininkai village[5].

The confusion may have arisen because there are other notable sites in Lithuania, such as the Hill of Crosses, which is indeed located near Šiauliai[6]. However, this is a different location and should not be confused with Aukštojas Hill.
