The provided answer is incorrect. Feng Kai did not win a gold medal in Men's Skeleton for China at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Here are the correct facts:

Feng Kai represented the People's Republic of China at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City[1][4]. He competed in short track speed skating events[1][4]. Specifically, Feng Kai was part of the Chinese men's 5000 meter relay team that won the bronze medal[1][2][4]. He also competed individually in the 500 meter and 1000 meter short track events, finishing 4th and 10th respectively[1].

It's worth noting that Men's Skeleton was not an event Feng Kai competed in. The gold medal in Men's Skeleton at the 2002 Winter Olympics was won by Jim Shea of the United States[2].
