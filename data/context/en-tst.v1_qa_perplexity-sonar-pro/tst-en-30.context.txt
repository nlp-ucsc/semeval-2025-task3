The statement "Ukrainian korbans were not a currency, but rather a type of metal used for decorative purposes" is incorrect. Here are the facts to correct this misconception:

The Ukrainian karbovanets was indeed a currency, not a decorative metal. It preceded the current Ukrainian national currency, the hryvnia. Specifically:

1. The karbovanets was used as the currency of Ukraine during three separate periods in the 20th century[5].

2. In its final iteration, the karbovanets replaced the Soviet ruble at par on January 10, 1992, after Ukraine gained independence[5][9].

3. The karbovanets suffered from hyperinflation in the early 1990s following the dissolution of the Soviet Union[3].

4. On September 2-16, 1996, a currency reform was carried out in Ukraine that replaced the karbovanets with the hryvnia as the new national currency[2][3].

5. The exchange rate for this transition was 100,000 karbovanets to 1 hryvnia[3][5].

Therefore, the Ukrainian karbovanets was a legitimate currency that directly preceded the current Ukrainian hryvnia, not a decorative metal as incorrectly stated.
