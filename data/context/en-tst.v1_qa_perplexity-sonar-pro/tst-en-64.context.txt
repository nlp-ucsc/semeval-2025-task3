The provided answer contains some inaccuracies and omissions regarding the native range of Cyrtophora moluccensis. Based on the search results, I can provide a more accurate response:

Cyrtophora moluccensis, commonly known as the tent spider or dome-web spider, is native to a wide range of countries across Asia and the Pacific. Its native range includes:

1. India[1][4][5]
2. Japan[1][4][5]
3. Indonesia[1][4][5]
4. Papua New Guinea[1][4][5]
5. Australia[1][4][5]
6. Fiji[1][4][5]
7. Tonga[1][4][5]

Additionally, its distribution extends to:

8. Solomon Islands[7]
9. Palau[7]
10. Micronesia[7]
11. French Polynesia[7]

The spider is often found in disturbed or open habitats from coastal areas to forest and mountainous interiors[1][5]. While the provided answer correctly mentions some Southeast Asian countries, it omits several key regions like India, Japan, and Australia. It also incorrectly refers to the spider as the Golden Orb-weaver or Banana Spider, which are names typically associated with different spider species.
