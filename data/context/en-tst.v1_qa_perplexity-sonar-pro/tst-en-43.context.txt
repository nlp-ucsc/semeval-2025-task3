The information provided in the search results contradicts the statement that the Groninger Museum has over 100,000 visitors per year. According to the available data:

1. The Groninger Museum receives an average of 200,000 visitors each year[2][8].

2. In recent years, visitor numbers have varied:
   - In 2024, the museum attracted 166,000 visitors[1].
   - In 2023, it had 243,705 visitors[1].
   - From 2008 to 2017, annual visitor numbers ranged from 173,000 to 292,000, with the exception of 2010 when the museum was closed for renovation[7].

3. The museum's highest recorded visitor count in recent years was approximately 290,000 in 2016[7].

These figures consistently show that the Groninger Museum attracts significantly more than 100,000 visitors per year, with numbers typically ranging between 170,000 and 290,000 annually. The statement that the museum has "over 100,000 visitors per year" is technically correct but greatly understates the actual visitor numbers.
