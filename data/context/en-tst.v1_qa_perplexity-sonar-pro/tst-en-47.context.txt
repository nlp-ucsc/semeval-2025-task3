The statement "L端 Li and WANG Tao won an Olympics gold in 2008" is incorrect. 

L端 Lin and Wang Tao won their Olympic gold medal in men's doubles table tennis at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona[1][5]. They competed together as a doubles team representing China and secured the gold medal in that event.

In 1996, L端 Lin and Wang Tao competed again in the Olympics in Atlanta, where they won a silver medal in men's doubles table tennis[1][5].

The 2008 Olympics were held in Beijing, China, but L端 Lin and Wang Tao did not win a gold medal that year. Their Olympic success came earlier in 1992 and 1996.
