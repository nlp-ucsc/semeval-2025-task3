Multiple sources confirm that there are indeed four Martello towers on Formentera:

1. The official tourism website of Formentera states: "In total there are four towers scattered across the island of Formentera"[5].

2. A travel website called TripBucket mentions: "Torre De La Gavina is one of the four Martello towers on Formentera Island"[7].

3. A magazine article from Ibiza Style also refers to "The defence towers of Formentera", implying the existence of multiple towers on the island[9].
