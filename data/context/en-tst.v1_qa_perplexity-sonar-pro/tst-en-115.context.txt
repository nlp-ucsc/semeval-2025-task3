The provided answer is incorrect. Based on the search results:

Le Mesnil-Opac was merged with Moyon Villages on January 1, 2016[1][2]. Specifically:

- Le Mesnil-Opac became a delegated commune within the new commune of Moyon Villages on January 1, 2016[2].
- The new commune of Moyon Villages was created on January 1, 2016 by merging the communes of Chevry, Le Mesnil-Opac, and Moyon[3].

The date of 1854 and the names "Le Moulin-de-Moyen" and "Muy-en-Beaufres" are not mentioned in any of the search results and appear to be incorrect. The merger occurred much more recently in 2016, not in the 19th century.
