The provided answer is incorrect. The mother of the Aloadae was not the goddess Aloê, nor was she the wife of Oceanus. 

According to Greek mythology, the mother of the Aloadae (Otus and Ephialtes) was Iphimedia (also spelled Iphimedeia)[1][4][7]. Iphimedia was the wife of Aloeus, but she became enamored with Poseidon. She would often go to the sea and scoop seawater into her lap, which led to her becoming pregnant by Poseidon[1][7]. Thus, while Aloeus was their stepfather (from whom they received their patronymic name Aloadae), their biological father was actually Poseidon[4][7].

It's important to note that Iphimedia was not a goddess, but rather a mortal woman. She was described as a daughter of Triops[1]. Additionally, she had no connection to Oceanus in the mythological accounts. Oceanus was married to Tethys, not to anyone named Aloê[5][8].

The confusion might stem from the similarity between the names Aloeus (the stepfather of the Aloadae) and Aloê, but there is no goddess by that name mentioned in connection with this myth in the reliable sources.
