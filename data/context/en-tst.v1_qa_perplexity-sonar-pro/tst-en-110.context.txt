The provided answer "No, there is not" is incorrect. According to the search results, there was indeed a year when the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role was not awarded.

Specifically, search result [1] states:

"No award was given out in this category in 1980, when no actors, male or female, were nominated for supporting roles."[1]

This information is corroborated by search result [3], which also mentions:

"The Best Supporting Actor award has been presented a total of 54 times to 48 different actors. No award was given out in this category in 1980."[3]

Therefore, the correct answer is that there was a year when the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role was not awarded, and that year was 1980. The award was not presented that year due to a lack of nominations in the supporting actor categories.
