The provided answer contains several inaccuracies that need to be corrected:

Emperor Uda abdicated on August 4, 897, not March 23, 842[1][4]. He was the 59th emperor of Japan, not the 57th[1][2][4]. At the time of his abdication, Uda was approximately 31 years old, not 16[1][2]. 

While it's true that Uda had an interest in Buddhism, his abdication was not primarily due to poor health or a desire to devote himself to religious pursuits. After abdicating, Uda continued to exercise power as the retired emperor (in no chō)[1]. He took up residence at Ninna-ji temple, which he had founded in 888, and lived there for about 30 years after his abdication[5].

Uda died on September 3, 931, at the age of 65, not in 868[1][4]. After his death, he was given the Buddhist name Kongō Kaku[4].

It's worth noting that Uda's reign spanned from 887 to 897, and he was succeeded by his eldest son, who became Emperor Daigo[1][4].
