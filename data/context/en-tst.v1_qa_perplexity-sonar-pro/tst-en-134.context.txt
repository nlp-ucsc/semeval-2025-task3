The statement that Yushu is Qinghai's second-largest city located in the northwestern part of the province is incorrect. Here are the key facts to correct this statement:

1. Yushu is not the second-largest city in Qinghai. According to the search results, Xining is the capital and most populous city of Qinghai province[5]. As of the 2020 census, Xining had a population of 2,467,965, with 1,954,795 living in the urban area[5].

2. Yushu is significantly smaller than Xining. In 2010, Yushu's overall population was 120,447, with 56,802 living within the city core[1]. More recent data indicates there are around 356,000 people in the metropolitan area as of 2020[1].

3. Yushu is not located in the northwestern part of Qinghai. It is situated in the southern part of the province. Specifically, Yushu is a county-level city of Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Southern Qinghai Province[1][7].

4. Yushu is actually the fourth largest city in Qinghai, not the second[1].

5. The largest city in Qinghai is Xining, which is located in the eastern part of the province, not the northwest[5][8].

In conclusion, Yushu is neither the largest nor the second-largest city in Qinghai, and it is located in the southern part of the province, not the northwest.
