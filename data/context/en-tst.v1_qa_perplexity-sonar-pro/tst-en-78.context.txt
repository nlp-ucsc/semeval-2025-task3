The answer provided contains several inaccuracies and cannot be verified based on the available search results. Here's a fact-checked response:

The Year of the Consulship of Cornelius and Vibulanus was 412 BC. According to the list of Roman consuls provided in search result [7], the consuls for that year were Q. Fabius Vibulanus Ambustus and C. Furius Pacilus[7]. 

There are several issues with the original answer:

1. It incorrectly states that the consuls were Gaius Cornelius Lentulus and Publius Vibulius Rufus. These names do not appear in the consular lists for the given time period.

2. The suggested time range (122 BC - 56 BC) is incorrect. The Roman Republic was established in 509 BC, and consuls were elected annually from that point onwards[1][2].

3. The claim that records from that time are incomplete is partially true for the very early Republic, but by 412 BC, consular records were generally well-maintained[1][2].

4. The statement that it's impossible to provide a definitive answer is incorrect. While there can be discrepancies in ancient sources, the consular year 412 BC is clearly recorded in multiple sources.

It's important to note that Roman years were often referred to by the names of the consuls in office, as this was the primary method of dating events in the Roman Republic[1][2]. The consular year began on January 1st from 153 BC onwards, but before that, it started on different dates, including March 15th from 222 BC to 153 BC[1][2].
