The given answer is incorrect. Let me provide the correct information about the factors of 150:

The factors of 150 are the whole numbers that divide 150 evenly without leaving a remainder. The complete list of factors of 150 is:

1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, and 150[1][2][5]

To break this down further:

1. There are 12 factors of 150 in total[1][2].
2. The smallest factor is 1 and the largest factor is 150 itself[5].
3. The prime factorization of 150 is 2 × 3 × 5²[2][5].
4. The positive pair factors of 150 are: (1, 150), (2, 75), (3, 50), (5, 30), (6, 25), and (10, 15)[1][2].

The answer provided in the query is incorrect because:
1. It doesn't list all the factors of 150.
2. It incorrectly states that 1, 2, and 5 are the only factors.
3. It introduces unrelated calculations and numbers (like 9, 30, 10,000, and 25,000) that are not relevant to the factors of 150.
4. It confuses factors with multiples, which are different concepts.

In conclusion, the factors of 150 are the 12 numbers listed above, ranging from 1 to 150, and can be derived through prime factorization or by finding all numbers that divide 150 without a remainder.
