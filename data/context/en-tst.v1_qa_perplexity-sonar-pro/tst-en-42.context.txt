The provided answer is incorrect. Marko Kristian Kiprusoff was born in Turku, Finland on June 6, 1972[1][2][3]. Multiple reliable sources confirm his birthplace as Turku, Finland, not Riga, Latvia. Additionally, the name given in the statement to be fact-checked ("Marko Kri≈æan Kuprashov") is not accurate - his full name is Marko Kristian Kiprusoff[1][2].
