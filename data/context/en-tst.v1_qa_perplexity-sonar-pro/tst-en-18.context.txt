The given answer is incorrect. Here are the correct facts:

Magnar Solberg, not Magnar Magnussen, won gold medals in the 20 km individual biathlon event at the Winter Olympics, not the Summer Olympics. Specifically:

1. Magnar Solberg won gold medals in the 20 km individual biathlon event at the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France and the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Japan[1][2][3].

2. Solberg was the first biathlete to successfully defend an Olympic gold medal in the individual event[1][3].

3. The events took place in 1968 and 1972, not 2008[1][2].

4. These were Winter Olympics, not Summer Olympics[1][2][3].

5. In addition to his two gold medals, Solberg also won a silver medal as part of Norway's 4 x 7.5 km relay team in 1968[1][2].

The original answer is entirely incorrect in terms of the athlete's name, the medal color, the year, the season of the Olympics, and the location.
