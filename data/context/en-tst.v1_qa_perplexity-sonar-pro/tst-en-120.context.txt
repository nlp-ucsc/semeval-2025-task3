The given answer is incorrect and contains multiple inaccuracies. Let me provide the correct information:

Dioumaténé is located in Mali, not Burkina Faso[1][4]. Specifically, it is a village and rural commune in the Cercle of Kadiolo in the Sikasso Region of southern Mali[1][4]. 

Regarding the language information:

1. Dioula (also spelled Jula) is not the primary language of Burkina Faso. While it is spoken in Burkina Faso, it is just one of many languages used there[3].

2. Bambara (also known as Bamanankan) is the most widely spoken language in Mali, used by about 80% of the population as a first or second language[2][5].

3. Mali has multiple official languages, including Bambara, Bobo, Bozo, Dogon, Fula, Arabic, Kassonke, Maninke, Minyanka, Senufo, Songhay languages, Soninke, and Tamasheq[5]. French is the working language in Mali[5].

In summary, Dioumaténé is in Mali, not Burkina Faso, and the language information provided in the original answer is inaccurate for both countries.
