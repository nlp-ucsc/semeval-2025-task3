The answer provided is incorrect. Based on the information from the search results, the Japanese era that came between Gen'ō and Shōchū was Genkō[1].

To provide the correct chronological order:

1. Gen'ō (元応) or Gennō: 1319[1]
2. Genkō (元亨): 1321[1]
3. Shōchū (正中): 1324[1]

It's important to note that these are not dynasties, but rather era names (年号, nengō) used in the Japanese calendar system. These specific era names fall within the Kamakura period (1185-1333 CE), which was a broader historical period in Japan[2][5]. However, the Kamakura period itself is not an era name that fits between Gen'ō and Shōchū.
