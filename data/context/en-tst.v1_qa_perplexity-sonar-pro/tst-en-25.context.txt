The statement that Paris Métro Line 8 opened on December 1, 1909 is incorrect. 

Paris Métro Line 8 actually opened on July 13, 1913[1][2]. Specifically:

1. The first section of Line 8 opened on July 13, 1913 between Beaugrenelle and Opéra stations[1][2].

2. It was then extended to Porte d'Auteuil on September 30, 1913[1][2].

3. The Invalides and Concorde stations opened later - Invalides on December 24, 1913 and Concorde on March 12, 1914[1].

So the correct opening date for the initial section of Paris Métro Line 8 is July 13, 1913, not December 1, 1909 as stated in the original answer. The line has undergone numerous extensions and modifications since its original opening, but 1913 marks its true inauguration as part of the Paris Métro system.
