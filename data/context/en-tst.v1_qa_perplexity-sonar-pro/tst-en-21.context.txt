The provided answer is incorrect. Here are the correct facts about Herman Frazier's gold medal achievements:

Herman Frazier won gold medals in the following events:

1. 4x400-meter relay at the 1976 Montreal Olympics[1][2][4]. He ran the first leg for the gold medal-winning team.

2. 4x400-meter relay at the 1975 Pan-American Games[1][2][7].

3. 4x400-meter relay at the 1979 Pan-American Games[1][2][7].

It's important to note that:

- Frazier did not win any gold medals in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. In fact, he was not a competitor in those games.
- He did not win gold medals in the 400m hurdles events, either for men or women.
- His Olympic achievements were in the 1976 Montreal Olympics, not the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.
- In addition to his relay gold medal, Frazier also won an individual bronze medal in the 400-meter dash at the 1976 Montreal Olympics[1][2][4].

The original answer is entirely inaccurate and does not reflect Herman Frazier's actual Olympic and Pan-American Games achievements.
