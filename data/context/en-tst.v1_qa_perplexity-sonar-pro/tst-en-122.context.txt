The information provided in the given answer is incorrect. According to the search results, the largest pet store in the world is not PetSmart in Santa Clara, California, but rather Zoo Zajac in Duisburg, Germany[1][7][10].

Zoo Zajac has been recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest pet store in the world since 2005[1]. It occupies a massive 130,000-square-foot warehouse in an industrial part of Duisburg[7]. The store houses approximately 250,000 individual animals of 3,000 different species[7][10].

Some key facts about Zoo Zajac:

1. It has a vending space of 8,070.26 square meters (86,867.6 sq ft)[1].
2. The store includes more than 1,000 aquariums, 70 pond tanks, 500 terrariums, 40 aviaries, a cat enclosure, and 150 small mammal enclosures[1].
3. It was founded by Norbert Zajac and his wife Jutta, who bought a pet store in Duisburg-Meiderich in 1975 and later expanded to the current location[1].

While PetSmart is indeed a large pet retailer in the United States, it does not hold the title of the world's largest pet store. PetSmart operates approximately 1,650 stores across the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico[5], but individual PetSmart locations are significantly smaller than Zoo Zajac.
