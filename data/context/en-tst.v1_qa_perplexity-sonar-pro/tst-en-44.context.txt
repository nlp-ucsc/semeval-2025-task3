Based on the search results provided, I can confirm that Vaux-en-Amiénois is indeed located in the Picardy (Picardie in French) region of northern France. However, some additional context and clarification is needed:

1. Picardy was historically a province and former administrative region of France[1][8].

2. As of January 1, 2016, Picardy is no longer an independent administrative region. It has been merged into the new larger region of Hauts-de-France[1][10].

3. Picardy stretched from north of Paris to the Somme River, bordered by Normandy to the west and Champagne to the east[5].

4. The historical province of Picardy included parts of the Somme, Oise, and Aisne departments[1][6].

5. Vaux-en-Amiénois, being located near Amiens (as suggested by its name), would fall within the historical and cultural territory of Picardy[3].

So while it is correct to say that Vaux-en-Amiénois is located in the area historically known as Picardy, it would be more accurate to state that it is now part of the Hauts-de-France region, which encompasses the former Picardy region.
