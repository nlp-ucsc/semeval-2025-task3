The answer that Mouthier is located in the department of Haute-Loire is incorrect.

Mouthier-Haute-Pierre is actually located in the Doubs department in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region of eastern France[1][2]. Specifically:

1. It is a commune in the Doubs department[2].

2. It lies 15 km southeast of Ornans in the Doubs department[2].

3. Mouthier-Haute-Pierre is situated 30 kilometers from Besançon, which is the capital of the Doubs department[5].

The search results consistently identify Mouthier-Haute-Pierre as being located in Doubs, not Haute-Loire. Therefore, the original statement is inaccurate and Mouthier-Haute-Pierre is definitively in the Doubs department of France.
