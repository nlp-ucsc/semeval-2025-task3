No, John Christopher Willis was not a proponent of natural selection. In fact, he was known for his criticism of natural selection as the primary mechanism of evolution. Here are the key points that contradict the given statement:

1. Willis developed the "Age and Area" hypothesis as an alternative explanation for species distribution patterns, which challenged aspects of natural selection theory[1][2].

2. He argued that natural selection could not adequately explain the origin of species based on his extensive botanical studies[3].

3. Willis proposed that evolution occurred primarily through large mutations rather than gradual changes driven by natural selection[1][3].

4. In his book "The Course of Evolution by Differentiation Or Divergent Mutation Rather Than by Selection" (1940), Willis explicitly argued against natural selection as the main driver of evolution[1][5].

5. He supported a form of saltational evolution, proposing that new forms arise by mutation rather than local adaptation through natural selection[1].

6. While Willis allowed that natural selection could play a subsidiary role, he maintained it could not explain the origin of species[3].

7. His views were considered controversial and were criticized by many contemporary scientists who supported Darwinian natural selection[1][7].

In summary, John Christopher Willis was not a proponent of natural selection, but rather a critic who proposed alternative mechanisms for evolution and species distribution. His work challenged the prevailing Darwinian view of gradual evolution through natural selection.
