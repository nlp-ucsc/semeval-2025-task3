The answer provided contains incorrect information and does not accurately describe Hugh Fraser's role in the Sharpe series. Here are the correct facts:

Hugh Fraser played the role of the Duke of Wellington in the Sharpe television series[3]. Specifically:

1. Hugh Fraser portrayed the Duke of Wellington in 9 TV movies of the Sharpe series between 1994 and 2006[3].

2. He replaced David Troughton in the role of the Duke of Wellington[3].

3. The Hugh Fraser being referred to is an English actor born on 23 October 1945, not a Scottish footballer born in 1883[3].

4. Fraser is best known for his roles as Captain Hastings in Agatha Christie's Poirot and as the Duke of Wellington in Sharpe[3].

5. There is no mention of Hugh Fraser playing a character named "Hughie" in the Sharpe series[3].

The original answer appears to be confusing Hugh Fraser the actor with a different person, possibly a footballer. The information about Hugh Fraser's role in Sharpe is readily available and well-documented, making it clear that he played the Duke of Wellington, not a character named Hughie or any Scottish footballer.
