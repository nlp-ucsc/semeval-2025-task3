No, Microsoft Edge is not the most popular browser. According to recent data from January 2025, Google Chrome remains the dominant web browser globally with a market share of 67.08%[1][3]. Microsoft Edge holds a much smaller market share of around 5.2%[1][3], placing it third behind Safari which has a 17.95% share[1]. 

Chrome's dominance extends across different devices and regions:

- On desktop, Chrome has a 65.14% market share compared to Edge's 13.06%[3]
- On mobile, Chrome leads with 65.84% while Edge has only 0.34%[3]
- Across regions like North America, Europe, and Asia, Chrome consistently maintains over 50% market share[3]

While Edge has made gains in recent years, surpassing Firefox to become the third most popular browser overall[8], it still lags far behind Chrome and Safari in global usage. Chrome's market share has remained relatively stable around 64-67% for the past several years[2][3], cementing its position as the clear leader in the browser market.
