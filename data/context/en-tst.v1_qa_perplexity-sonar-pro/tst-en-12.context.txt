The answer provided is incorrect. There are no species of the genus Abrus native to the Americas. According to the reliable sources:

1. Abrus is a genus of 13-18 species that range naturally across tropical Africa, Madagascar, the Arabian Peninsula, south and southeast Asia, southern China, New Guinea, and Australia[2].

2. Abrus precatorius, the most well-known species of the genus, is native to Asia and Australia but has been introduced to the Neotropics[3][4].

3. The genus Abrus is described as native to the paleotropics, predominantly Afro-Madagascan in distribution with the remaining species African, Asian and pantropical[4].

4. Abrus precatorius has been introduced to the Americas and is now naturalized in many parts of the tropics including Hawaii and the West Indies[4].

The species names mentioned in the given answer (Abrutilis, Abrunosa, and Abrutus) do not appear to be valid scientific names for any Abrus species. There is no evidence from reputable sources supporting the existence of native Abrus species in the Americas. All Abrus species found in the Americas are introduced and not native to the region.
