The provided answer contains some inaccuracies and requires fact-checking. Based on the search results, I can provide the following accurate information about where the BMW X2 is assembled:

1. Regensburg, Germany: This is correct. The BMW Plant in Regensburg produces the BMW X2, including the new second generation and the first iX2 (electric version). It is exclusively manufactured for global markets in Regensburg[1][4][5].

2. San Luis Potosi, Mexico: This is incorrect. While the BMW plant in San Luis Potosi does produce BMW vehicles, there is no specific mention of X2 production at this facility. The plant primarily produces the BMW 3 Series[2].

3. Shenyang, China: This is partially correct. BMW Brilliance Automotive in Shenyang does produce BMW X models, including the X1 and X2, for the Chinese market[3][7].

4. Rosslyn, South Africa: This is incorrect. There is no information in the search results supporting X2 production in South Africa.

The most accurate statement is that the BMW X2 is primarily produced at the Regensburg plant in Germany for global markets, with some production also occurring in Shenyang, China for the Chinese market. The information about production in Mexico and South Africa is not supported by the given search results.

It's important to note that production locations can change over time, so the most up-to-date information should be obtained from official BMW sources.
