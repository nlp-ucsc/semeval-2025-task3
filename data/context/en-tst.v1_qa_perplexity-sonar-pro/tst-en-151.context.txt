The statement that "The film began filming in June 2016 in New York City" is incorrect based on the available information. According to multiple reliable sources:

1. Filming for "Hit Man" began in October 2022 in New Orleans, Louisiana[5][6][7].

2. Specifically, the filming dates are reported as October 4, 2022 to November 16, 2022[5].

3. Production was completed in November 2022[6][7].

The correct information about the filming of "Hit Man" is:

- Filming location: New Orleans, Louisiana, USA
- Start date: October 2022
- End date: November 2022

This information contradicts the claim about filming beginning in June 2016 in New York City. The film was shot much more recently and in a different location than stated in the original answer.
