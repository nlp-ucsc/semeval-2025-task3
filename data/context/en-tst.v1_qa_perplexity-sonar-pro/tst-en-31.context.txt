The information provided in the given answer is incorrect. Here are the correct facts about the deepest known cave on Earth:

The deepest known cave on Earth is Veryovkina Cave, located in the Arabika Massif in Abkhazia, a disputed region of Georgia[4]. Key facts about Veryovkina Cave include:

1. Depth: It has a record depth of 2,212 meters (7,257 feet)[4].

2. Discovery and exploration: The cave was first discovered in 1968 by Soviet speleologists, but its true depth was only confirmed in recent years after decades of exploration[4].

3. Location: It is situated in the Arabika Massif, an area known for hosting several of the world's deepest caves[4].

4. Other deep caves: The Arabika Massif is also home to other extremely deep caves, including Krubera-Voronja (2,199 m), Sarma (1,830 m), and Snezhnaja (1,760 m)[4].

It's worth noting that cave exploration is an ongoing process, and new discoveries or more accurate measurements could potentially change these rankings in the future. For example, the Chev√© Cave system in Mexico is believed to potentially descend nearly 2.57 km (1.6 miles) based on water flow, though this has not been fully explored or confirmed[4].

The answer provided in the query is incorrect in several aspects:
1. The deepest cave is not called "Sinkhole".
2. It is not located in the Mexican state of Coahuila.
3. The depth mentioned (over 2,000 meters) is close but not accurate.
4. There is no evidence to support the claim that it is over a billion years old.
