The provided answer contains some inaccuracies and omissions based on the search results. Here is a more accurate account of the first settlers of Steelville, Missouri:

According to the search results, the first settlers in Steelville were:

1. William Britton: He came to the area in 1833 and built a small log house and a grist mill along the Yadkin Creek[1][5].

2. James Steel: He was the next settler to arrive, around 1835. Steel built a small store on what is now Main Street and purchased 40 acres of land from the government, which he later sold to the county court[1][5].

James Steel is considered the founding father of Steelville. The town was named after him when the Crawford County Court designated it as the county seat[1].

Other early settlers mentioned in the search results include:

- Peter Whittenburg
- Simeon Frost
- James Davis[5]

The town was officially founded in 1835 when James Steel sold the land to the county court. It was platted and the first deeds to lots were sold for $12 each[1].

The search results do not mention John H. McMurtry, John H. Dillon, or the McClure families as being among the first settlers of Steelville. The information about these individuals does not appear to be supported by the provided search results.

It's worth noting that Steelville was originally known as "Valley of Springs"[9], though this detail was not included in the original answer.
