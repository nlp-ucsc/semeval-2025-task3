Yes, it is possible to have multiple Dharma names. This is supported by several points from the search results:

1. Many well-known Buddhist teachers have had multiple Dharma names throughout their careers, with each name often representing a different stage or aspect of their practice[1]. For example:

- Prince Shotoku was also known as Prince Umayado and Prince Kamitsumiya
- Shinran had names including Matsuwakamaru, Hanen, Shakku, Zenshin, and others
- Nichiren was originally named Zennichi and had Dharma names Zenshobo Rencho and Rissho Daishi

2. In Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism, practitioners may receive multiple names at different stages[1]:
- A Refuge name when taking the Triple Refuge 
- A Bodhisattva name when taking Bodhisattva vows
- A secret Samaya name for certain Tantric rites

3. Some teachers encourage taking Refuge vows multiple times to renew them, potentially resulting in receiving additional names[3].

4. In Chinese Mahayana traditions, monks and nuns may receive several Dharma names serving different purposes[1]:
- One for public use
- One reflecting the transmitted lineage 
- A second Dharma name for other uses

5. Personal accounts mention individuals having multiple Dharma names from different traditions or teachers[3].

So while having a single Dharma name is common, it is entirely possible and even typical in some traditions to accumulate multiple Dharma names over the course of one's Buddhist practice and studies. The names often reflect different aspects of one's path or relationships with various teachers and lineages.
