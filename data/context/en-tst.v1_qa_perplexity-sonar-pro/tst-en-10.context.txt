The provided answer is outdated and incorrect. Here is the accurate information:

Currently, there is a one-term limit for the Colombian president. In 2015, a constitutional amendment was passed that repealed the previous two-term limit and reverted to the original one-term restriction[3][4][7]. This means that:

1. Presidents can only serve one four-year term in office[4][7].
2. Re-election is not allowed, even for non-consecutive terms[3][7].
3. The two-term limit that was in place from 2004 to 2015 no longer applies[4][7].

It's important to note that Juan Manuel Santos served as president from 2010 to 2018, completing two terms under the previous rules[8]. However, future presidents are now limited to a single four-year term without the possibility of re-election[4][7].

This change was made to prevent the concentration of power and to ensure a regular turnover in the country's highest office[3]. The current term limit can only be modified through a constitutional assembly or a national referendum[1].
