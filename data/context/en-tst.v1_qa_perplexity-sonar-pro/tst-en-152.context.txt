Edward Drinker Cope named the family Nimravidae, which includes the false saber-toothed cats[1][3]. 

The Nimravidae are an extinct family of carnivorous mammals that are sometimes referred to as "false saber-toothed cats"[7]. They evolved similar features to true saber-toothed cats through parallel evolution, but are not closely related to true cats[3].

Some key facts about Nimravidae:

- They lived during the late Eocene and Oligocene epochs, approximately 35.3 to 26.3 million years ago[3].

- Fossils have been found in North America, Asia, and Europe[3][7].

- Notable genera include Nimravus, Hoplophoneus, and Eusmilus[1][3].

- They had saber-like canine teeth and other cat-like features, but differed from true cats in skull structure and other anatomical details[1].

Edward Drinker Cope was a prominent American paleontologist who made many contributions to vertebrate paleontology in the late 19th century[4]. He named and described numerous fossil taxa, including the Nimravidae family.

The answer "Copes' cat" is incorrect. While Cope did name the Nimravidae family, they are not referred to as "Copes' cat". The proper name for this group is Nimravidae or false saber-toothed cats.
