The provided answer is incorrect. The dry boiling point of DOT 5 brake fluid is significantly higher than 212°F (100°C).

According to the search results, DOT 5 brake fluid has a much higher dry boiling point:

1. DOT 5 brake fluid has a dry boiling point of 500°F (260°C)[4].

2. The Department of Transportation (DOT) specifications require DOT 5 brake fluid to have a minimum dry boiling point of 500°F (260°C)[6].

3. Silicone-based DOT 5 brake fluid was developed to handle higher temperatures and has a higher boiling point compared to DOT 3 and DOT 4 fluids[4].

4. The dry boiling point of 500°F (260°C) for DOT 5 brake fluid is significantly higher than the 212°F (100°C) mentioned in the answer to be fact-checked[4][6].

It's important to note that 212°F (100°C) is actually the boiling point of water, not DOT 5 brake fluid. DOT 5 brake fluid is specifically designed to have a much higher boiling point to withstand the extreme temperatures generated during braking.
