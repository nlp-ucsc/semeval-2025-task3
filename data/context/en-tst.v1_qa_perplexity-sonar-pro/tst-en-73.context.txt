I apologize, but the information provided in that answer is incorrect. According to the search results, the police chief in "The Leftovers" was played by Justin Theroux, not Kevin Carroll[1][7][10]. 

Specifically:

1. Justin Theroux played Kevin Garvey, who was initially Mapleton's chief of police[1].

2. In the pilot episode, Theroux portrayed "the police chief [who] faces struggles in both his personal and professional life"[7].

3. In an interview, Theroux discussed playing "a former police chief who has moved from New York to Texas" in the second season of the show[10].

Kevin Carroll did have a role in "The Leftovers," but he played John Murphy, not the police chief[5][8]. Carroll joined the cast in the second season as a new character.

The correct information is that Justin Theroux portrayed the police chief character Kevin Garvey throughout the series run from 2014 to 2017.
