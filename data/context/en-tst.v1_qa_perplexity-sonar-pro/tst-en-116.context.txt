The provided answer is incorrect. According to the search results, the population of Labalme, France in 1982 was 104[1][4][7]. This figure is consistently reported across multiple sources, including official population statistics from the Institut National de la Statistique et des Études Économiques (INSEE) in France. The population of Labalme has been relatively small, with gradual increases over the years, but nowhere near the 1,976 inhabitants claimed for 1984. In fact, the population only reached 214 by 2015[1], which is still significantly lower than the incorrect figure provided.
