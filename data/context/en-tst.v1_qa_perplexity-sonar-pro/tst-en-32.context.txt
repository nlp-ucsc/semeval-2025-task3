The statement "Horrific mid-air collision" is incorrect and does not accurately describe the Air France Flight 296Q crash. Here is the correct explanation:

Air France Flight 296Q crashed during a low-altitude flyover at an air show on June 26, 1988[1][2]. The Airbus A320 was performing a demonstration flight at Mulhouse-Habsheim Airport in France when it descended too low, struck trees at the end of the runway, and crashed into a nearby forest[1][4]. The aircraft was flying at a very low altitude (around 30 feet instead of the planned 100 feet), at a slow speed, with engines at flight idle[4]. When the pilots attempted to apply go-around power, it was too late to avoid the collision with the trees[4]. The crash resulted in three fatalities due to smoke inhalation, while the other 133 passengers and crew survived the initial impact[2][4]. This was not a mid-air collision, but rather a controlled flight into terrain during an air show demonstration.
