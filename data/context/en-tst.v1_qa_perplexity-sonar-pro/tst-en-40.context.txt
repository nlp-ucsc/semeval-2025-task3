The given answer is incorrect and mixes up different sports. Let me provide the correct information:

The Cuba men's national volleyball team has indeed won a gold medal in a World Cup. Specifically, they won the gold medal at the 1989 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup[4]. This achievement is part of their impressive record in international volleyball competitions.

To clarify and correct the errors in the given answer:

1. The question is about volleyball, not soccer (football). The FIFA World Cup is a soccer tournament, while the FIVB World Cup is for volleyball.

2. Cuba has won medals in volleyball World Cups, including gold, silver, and bronze medals.

3. In addition to their 1989 gold medal, Cuba's men's volleyball team has also won silver medals in 1981 and 1991, and a bronze medal in 1977 in the FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup[4].

It's important to distinguish between different sports and their respective world championships when answering such questions. The Cuba men's national volleyball team has a strong record in international competitions, including World Cups, World Championships, and Olympic Games.
