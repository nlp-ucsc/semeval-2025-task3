The claim that the population of Étiolles is around 10,000 people as of 2021 is incorrect.

According to official statistics from INSEE (the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies), the population of Étiolles in 2021 was 3,086[1]. More recent estimates for 2022 put the population at 3,100 inhabitants[3][5].

The population of Étiolles has remained relatively stable in recent years:

- In 2017, it was 3,161[7]
- In 2021, it was 3,086[1]
- The latest estimate for 2022 is 3,100[3][5]

These figures show that the actual population of Étiolles is significantly lower than the 10,000 claimed, being closer to 3,100 inhabitants. The town is classified as having a population ranking of 3,640th nationally in France[5], which is consistent with a smaller population size.

Étiolles is a commune in the Essonne department in the Île-de-France region, located about 27 kilometers southeast of Paris[7]. It has a land area of 11.7 square kilometers[5], resulting in a population density of about 266 inhabitants per square kilometer[3][5], which is higher than the average for French communes but still indicative of a smaller town rather than a larger urban area.
