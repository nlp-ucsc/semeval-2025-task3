The statement that Health composed the soundtrack for "Inside" by Tame Impala in 2015 is incorrect. Here are the facts based on the search results:

Health has indeed composed video game soundtracks, but not for any Tame Impala projects. Specifically:

1. Health composed the soundtrack for the video game Max Payne 3[4].

2. They also contributed music to other video games, including:
   - Grand Theft Auto V
   - Cyberpunk 2077 (the song "Major Crimes")
   - GTA Online's Arena War update
   - Ultrakill[4]

3. Tame Impala is a separate band led by Kevin Parker, and is not associated with Health's video game soundtrack work[5][8].

4. The year 2015 was significant for Health, but for releasing their album Death Magic, not for any video game soundtrack work[4].

So while Health has composed music for video games, they did not create a soundtrack for any Tame Impala project called "Inside" in 2015 or at any other time.
