The provided answer is incorrect. In the 2013 Iranian presidential election, there were actually six candidates who participated in the final election, not three as stated[1]. The candidates were:

1. Hassan Rouhani
2. Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf
3. Saeed Jalili
4. Mohsen Rezaee
5. Ali Akbar Velayati
6. Mohammad Gharazi

Hassan Rouhani won the election with over 50% of the vote, avoiding a second round[1]. It's worth noting that initially, eight candidates were approved by the Guardian Council to run in the election. However, two of them - Mohammad Reza Aref and Gholam-Ali Haddad-Adel - withdrew their candidacies in the days leading up to the election[1]. 

The answer provided in the query incorrectly mentions Ebrahim Raisi, who was not a candidate in the 2013 election. Raisi ran in the 2017 presidential election against Rouhani, not in 2013[2].
