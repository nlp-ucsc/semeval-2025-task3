Based on the search results provided, the claim that Hans Einarsson was the first chairman of the Baptist Union of Norway appears to be incorrect. According to search result [1], which cites information from Wikipedia:

Janne M. Sj√∂dahl was appointed the union's first chairman when the Baptist Union of Norway was officially founded in 1879[1].

The search results do not mention Hans Einarsson in relation to being the first chairman. Therefore, the original claim cannot be verified and appears to be inaccurate based on the available information.
