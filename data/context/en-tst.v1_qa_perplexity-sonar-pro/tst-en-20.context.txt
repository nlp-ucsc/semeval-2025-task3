The provided answer is incorrect. Let me provide the accurate information:

Kyle Korver did not beat Steve Kerr's career three-point shooting percentage. Steve Kerr holds the NBA record for the highest career three-point percentage at 45.4%[2][5]. Kyle Korver, while an excellent three-point shooter, has a career three-point percentage of 42.9%[10], which is lower than Kerr's record.

The percentages mentioned in the original answer (37.6% for Korver and 35.4% for Kerr) are not accurate for either player's career three-point shooting percentages.

It's worth noting that Korver did set an NBA record for the highest single-season three-point percentage in 2009-10, shooting 53.6%[3]. This surpassed the previous single-season record of 52.4% held by Steve Kerr from the 1994-95 season[4]. However, this single-season achievement does not change the fact that Kerr's career percentage remains higher than Korver's.

In summary, while both are elite three-point shooters, Steve Kerr maintains the highest career three-point percentage in NBA history, with Kyle Korver ranking among the top shooters but not surpassing Kerr's career mark.
