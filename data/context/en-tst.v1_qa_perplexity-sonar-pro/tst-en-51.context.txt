The statement that corn salad does not produce flowers is incorrect. Corn salad (Valerianella locusta), also known as m√¢che or lamb's lettuce, does indeed produce flowers.

Corn salad is an annual flowering plant that produces small flowers as part of its life cycle[3][6][7]. Here are the key facts about corn salad flowers:

1. Flower appearance: The flowers are small, with 5 petals, and are typically pale blue, mauve, or white in color[6][7].

2. Flowering time: Corn salad usually flowers between April and June[4][6].

3. Flower arrangement: The flowers appear in dense clusters (called umbel-like or umbellate cymes) at the ends of the stems[6][7].

4. Flower structure: The flowers have a funnel-shaped structure with 5 unequal, rounded lobes[7].

5. Purpose: Like other flowering plants, corn salad produces flowers as part of its reproductive cycle, which eventually leads to seed production[3].

While corn salad is primarily grown and harvested for its edible leaves, it is indeed a flowering plant. The flowers, though small, are an important part of the plant's life cycle and can even be eaten along with the leaves[6].
