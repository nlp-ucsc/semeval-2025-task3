Chuseok, also known as Korean Thanksgiving, is indeed a three-day holiday in South Korea[1][2][5]. The celebration typically lasts for three days, including the day of Chuseok and the days before and after it[1][9]. 

However, the statement about the specific dates (September 23 to September 25) is not accurate. The exact dates of Chuseok vary each year according to the lunar calendar. For example:

- In 2024, Chuseok will be celebrated from September 16 to 18[1][9].
- In 2023, it was observed from September 28 to 30[1].

The holiday is celebrated on the 15th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar, which typically falls in September or October in the Gregorian calendar[1][4].

The claim about the holiday potentially lasting up to five days due to weekend effects is not explicitly mentioned in the provided search results. While it's possible that the holiday period could be extended if it falls near a weekend, this information is not directly confirmed by the given sources.

In summary, the core fact that Chuseok is a three-day holiday is correct, but the specific dates mentioned in the original answer are inaccurate, and the extension to five days is not substantiated by the provided information.
