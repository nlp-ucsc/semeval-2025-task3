I apologize, but the information provided in that answer is incorrect. There is no evidence in the search results or in my knowledge base to support the claim that Zonitoides snails use love darts. 

To clarify:

1. Zonitoides are land snails, not marine snails[1].

2. Love darts are used by some terrestrial snail species, not marine organisms[1][5].

3. Love darts are not bioluminescent structures released into water. They are calcareous or chitinous darts physically stabbed into a mating partner during terrestrial snail courtship[1][5].

4. Love darts are not used to attract mates, but rather to inject hormones that increase the chances of successful fertilization[5][6].

The search results do not mention Zonitoides specifically using love darts. Love darts are primarily associated with certain land snail families like Helicidae, not necessarily all terrestrial snails[1][5]. Without specific evidence about Zonitoides, we cannot confirm if they use love darts or not. The correct answer would be that we don't have enough information to determine if Zonitoides use love darts based on the provided search results.
