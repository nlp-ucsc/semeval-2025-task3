The provided answer about Paul Egede is incorrect. Here are the key facts to correct the misinformation:

Paul Egede was not sent by the Dutch East India Company to the East Indies. Instead, he worked as a missionary in Greenland, continuing the mission his father Hans Egede had established there[10]. Specifically:

1. Paul Egede was born in Norway and went to Greenland as a child with his father Hans Egede in 1721[10].

2. The mission to Greenland was established by Hans Egede through the Bergen Greenland Company, not the Dutch East India Company[4].

3. Paul Egede continued his father's work of missionizing among the Kalaallit (Inuit) people of Greenland, not rulers in the East Indies[10].

4. The focus was on spreading Lutheran Christianity to the Inuit population, not establishing trade relations[10].

5. This missionary work took place in Greenland, not the East Indies[10].

So in summary, Paul Egede's missionary work was centered in Greenland, continuing the Lutheran mission his father had started there, rather than being sent by a Dutch company to the East Indies as the original answer incorrectly stated.
