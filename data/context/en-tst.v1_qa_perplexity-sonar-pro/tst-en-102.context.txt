The answer provided is incorrect. According to the search results, two bronze medals were awarded for the Women's +67 kg Taekwondo event at the 2012 Summer Olympics, not three as claimed.

The correct information is as follows:

1. In the Women's +67 kg (heavyweight) category, two bronze medals were awarded[1].

2. The bronze medalists for this event were:
   - Anastasia Baryshnikova from Russia
   - Mar√≠a Espinoza from Mexico[1]

3. This aligns with the general practice in Olympic taekwondo competitions since 2008, where two bronze medals are awarded in each weight category[2].

4. The search results provide a table showing the medal winners for the Women's +67 kg event, clearly indicating two bronze medalists[1].

Therefore, the correct number of bronze medals awarded for the Women's +67 kg Taekwondo at the 2012 Summer Olympics was two, not three as stated in the original answer.
