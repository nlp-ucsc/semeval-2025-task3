The provided answer contains several inaccuracies. Here's the correct information about the Autonomous Province of Korçë:

The Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë, also known as the Autonomous Province of Korçë, was a short-lived, self-governing entity established on December 10, 1916, during World War I[1][5]. It was proclaimed by fourteen Albanian delegates, including seven Muslims and seven Christians, under the military protection of the French army[1][5]. The autonomous province was not part of the Kingdom of Greece, but rather an Albanian entity[1].

Key points to correct the inaccuracies:

1. The official name was the Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë, not "Autonomic Province"[1][5].
2. It was established in 1916, not 1912[1][5].
3. It lasted until 1920, not 1924[7].
4. The capital was Korçë (also spelled Korça or Korce), not "Corçova"[1][7].
5. It was an Albanian entity, not a Greek one[1][5].
6. The autonomous province was created as a result of Albanian nationalist efforts and French military intervention, not as part of Ottoman Greece[1][5].

The Autonomous Province of Korçë was a brief experiment in local self-government that strengthened Albanian nationalism in the region, under French protection during World War I[1][5].
