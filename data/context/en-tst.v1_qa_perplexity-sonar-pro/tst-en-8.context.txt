The statement that Cape Verde participated in its first Summer Olympic games in 2000 in Sydney, Australia is incorrect.

Cape Verde actually made its Olympic debut at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, United States[1][3][9]. This was the first time Cape Verde competed in the Olympic Games. The country has participated in every Summer Olympics since then[1][3].

Specifically:

1. Cape Verde's National Olympic Committee was formed in 1989 and officially recognized by the International Olympic Committee in September 1993[1].

2. The country sent its first Olympic delegation to the 1996 Atlanta Games[1][9].

3. At the 1996 Olympics, Cape Verde was represented by 4 athletes (3 men and 1 woman) competing in athletics events[9].

4. Since their debut in 1996, Cape Verde has competed in all subsequent Summer Olympic Games[1][3].

Therefore, the correct statement would be that Cape Verde first participated in the Summer Olympics in 1996 in Atlanta, not in 2000 in Sydney.
