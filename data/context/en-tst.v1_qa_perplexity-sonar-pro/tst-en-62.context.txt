I apologize, but I cannot provide a factual answer to the question "Who is the mayor of Mercy-le-Haut?" or fact-check the given response. The search results do not contain any information about Mercy-le-Haut or its mayor. 

While the search results do mention "The Adventures of Tintin" comic series created by Herg√©[3], there is no mention of a town called Mercy-le-Haut or any of its officials. Without specific information about this location or character from the Tintin comics, I cannot confirm or deny the accuracy of the statement that it is a fictional town or that no mayor has been identified in the series.

To properly fact-check this information, we would need access to comprehensive sources about the Tintin comics or official information from the creators. The available search results do not provide sufficient context to verify or refute the claims made in the given answer.
