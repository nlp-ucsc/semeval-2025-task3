The provided answer contains several inaccuracies. Here's a fact-checked response based on the search results:

Fredrikstad Fotballklubb (FFK) changed its home ground stadium in 2007, not 2006. The club moved from the old Fredrikstad Stadion to the new Fredrikstad Stadion[1][2][7].

Key corrections:

1. FFK was founded in 1903, not 1890[2][6].

2. The old stadium was called Fredrikstad Stadion (also known as Old Fredrikstad Stadion), not Bymarka IP[5].

3. The old stadium opened in 1914, not when the club was founded[5].

4. The new Fredrikstad Stadion opened in 2007, not 2006 or 2009[1][3][7].

5. The new stadium's capacity is approximately 12,560 (or 12,565), not 13,000[3][7].

6. The new stadium was not built as part of a centennial celebration. It was built to replace the old stadium, which was considered one of the oldest and most worn-out in the country[7].

Correct information:

Fredrikstad FK used the old Fredrikstad Stadion as their home ground from 1914 until the end of the 2006 season[5]. In 2007, they moved to the new Fredrikstad Stadion, which is located in an area that was formerly a large shipyard[1][7]. The new stadium has a capacity of approximately 12,560 seats and was built to meet modern facility requirements[3][7].
