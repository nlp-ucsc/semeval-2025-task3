The provided answer is correct. Argentina does not have a "Federal Department" as a province. Instead, Argentina is composed of 23 provinces and one autonomous city, Buenos Aires, which serves as the federal capital[3][7]. 

To elaborate:

1. Argentina is a federal republic divided into 23 provinces and one autonomous city[2][3][4].

2. The autonomous city of Buenos Aires is the federal capital and the seat of the national government[3][5].

3. Each province has its own government, constitution, and laws, but they all operate under the federal system established by the national constitution[3][6].

4. The federal government of Argentina is composed of three branches: Executive, Legislative, and Judicial, with the President as the head of the executive branch[3].

5. The provinces are further subdivided into departments and municipalities for administrative purposes, except for Buenos Aires Province, which is divided into partidos[3].

Therefore, the original answer accurately states that there is no "Federal Department" province in Argentina, and correctly describes the country's administrative structure.
