The provided answer contains some inaccuracies. Based on the search results, I can provide a more accurate timeline of Frances Farmer's first psychiatric institutionalization:

Frances Farmer was first committed to a psychiatric institution on January 21, 1943, not in 1942 as the original answer stated[1]. This occurred after a series of legal troubles and erratic behavior in late 1942 and early 1943, including:

1. An arrest for driving with her headlights on during a wartime blackout in October 1942[1].
2. Failing to pay the remainder of her fine by January 1943[1].
3. An assault charge filed by a studio hairdresser[1].
4. Erratic behavior during her court hearing on January 13, 1943[1].

After her arrest and court appearance, Farmer was initially sentenced to 180 days in jail. However, through efforts of her sister-in-law, she avoided jail time and was instead transferred to the psychiatric ward of Los Angeles General Hospital on January 21, 1943[1]. There, she was diagnosed with "manic depressive psychosis, probably the forerunner of a definite dementia praecox"[1].

Days later, with assistance from the Screen Actors Guild, she was transferred to the Kimball Sanitarium, a minimum-security psychiatric institute in the San Fernando Valley, where she was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia[1].

It's important to note that her commitment to Western State Hospital in Washington state, which the original answer mentions, actually occurred later. Farmer was first committed to Western State Hospital in March 1944, not in 1942 as the original answer suggests[5].

This timeline provides a more accurate account of when Frances Farmer was first interned in a psychiatric institution, correcting the year and providing specific dates and locations based on the available search results.
