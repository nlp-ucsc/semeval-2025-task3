The claim that Valeille had a population of 2,961 in 2020 is incorrect. According to official population data:

In 2020, Valeille had a population of 690 inhabitants[1][3].

This figure comes from multiple reliable sources:

1. The French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) reports that the legal population of Valeille in 2020 was 690[3].

2. The Wikipedia page for Valeille also lists the 2020 population as 690[1].

3. Other population data sources show similar figures, with estimates ranging from 680-690 inhabitants for Valeille around 2020-2022[5][7].

The claimed population of 2,961 is significantly higher than all official and estimated figures, and does not match any historical population data for Valeille. The actual 2020 population of 690 represents a slight decrease from previous years, as Valeille had 704 inhabitants in 2014 and 646 in 2009[1][3].
