The previous answer is incorrect. Favara is indeed located in Spain, specifically in the Valencian Community. Here are the key facts to correct the misinformation:

Favara is a municipality in the Province of Valencia, which is part of the Valencian Community (Comunidad Valenciana) in Spain[4]. It is situated in the comarca (region) of Ribera Baixa[4].

Specific details about Favara include:

1. Its postal code is 46614[1].
2. It is located at latitude 39.12743 and longitude -0.29104[1].
3. The official language is Spanish, and the time zone is Europe/Madrid[1].
4. As of January 1, 2024, Favara had an estimated population of 2,701 inhabitants[7].

Favara is a real place within the Valencia province, contrary to what the previous answer stated. It's important to note that while Valencia is indeed a city and an autonomous community in Spain, it also contains smaller municipalities like Favara within its provincial boundaries.
