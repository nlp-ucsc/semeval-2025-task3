The provided answer is incorrect. The Danish Golden Age is not called "Københavns Golden Era" in Danish.

The correct term for the Danish Golden Age in Danish is "Den danske guldalder"[2]. This translates directly to "The Danish Golden Age" in English.

Some key points about the Danish Golden Age:

1. It refers to a period of exceptional creative and cultural production in Denmark, particularly during the first half of the 19th century[2].

2. The term "Guldalderen" (Golden Age) was first used in 1890 by Danish philosopher Valdemar Vedel to describe this period[2].

3. It encompasses achievements in various fields including painting, literature, philosophy, and science[1][2].

4. The period is traditionally considered to have lasted from around 1800 to 1850, though some extend it to 1864[1][2].

5. It occurred despite Denmark facing significant challenges, including fires, bombardment, and national bankruptcy[1][2].

In conclusion, the Danish name for this period is "Den danske guldalder," not "Københavns Golden Era." The latter term is not used in Danish to refer to this historical and cultural period.
