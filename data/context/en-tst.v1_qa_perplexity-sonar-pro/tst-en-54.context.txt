I can confirm that F.E.A.R. did receive recognition for its innovative use of AI, but I need to make some corrections and clarifications to the provided answer:

1. F.E.A.R. won GameSpot's "2005 Best AI Award"[1][3]. This is accurate and can be verified.

2. The game earned the #2 ranking on AIGameDev's "Most Influential AI Games" in 2007[1][6]. This is also accurate.

3. There is no evidence in the provided search results that F.E.A.R. won or was nominated for an AI award at the 2005 Interactive Achievement Awards (IAA) or the 2006 Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences (AIAS) awards. The search results do not mention these specific awards.

4. The search results do not mention F.E.A.R. being a finalist for Best AI at the 2005 Game Developers Choice Awards.

5. The AI system in F.E.A.R. is not named Alma Wade. Alma Wade is a character in the game, not the AI system[5]. The game uses a system called GOAP (Goal Oriented Action Planning) for its AI[1][6].

6. While the AI in F.E.A.R. was indeed advanced for its time, the search results do not specifically mention that it could learn from the player's actions and adjust tactics. The AI was praised for its ability to work as a team, perform flanking maneuvers, and use cover effectively[3].

In summary, while F.E.A.R. did receive recognition for its AI, some of the specific awards mentioned in the answer are not supported by the provided search results. The game's AI system was indeed innovative, but it's important to accurately represent its capabilities and the awards it received.
