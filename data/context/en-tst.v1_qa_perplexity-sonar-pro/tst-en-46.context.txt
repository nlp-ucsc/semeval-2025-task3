The given answer is incorrect. Bombykol is not released by female ants. Here are the key facts about which insects release bombykol:

1. Bombykol is a pheromone released by female silkworm moths (Bombyx mori) to attract mates[1][9].

2. It is also the sex pheromone used by the wild silk moth (Bombyx mandarina)[1][9].

3. Bombykol was the first insect sex pheromone to be chemically identified and characterized, discovered by Adolf Butenandt in 1959[1][9].

4. It is produced in tiny amounts from glands in the end of the abdomen of female silkworm moths[3].

5. Male silkworm moths have specialized sensory structures on their antennae to detect extremely low concentrations of bombykol released by females[3][5].

So in summary, bombykol is specifically released by female silkworm moths and wild silk moths of the genus Bombyx, not by ants or other insects. The original answer was incorrect in attributing this pheromone to ants.
