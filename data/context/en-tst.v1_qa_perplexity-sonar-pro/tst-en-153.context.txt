The provided answer is incorrect. Garajonay National Park is not named after a volcano called Garaja. 

The park is actually named after a legendary love story between two young people, Gara and Jonay[1][3][4]. According to the legend, Gara was a princess from La Gomera, and Jonay was a young man from Tenerife. They fell in love, but their relationship was forbidden due to rivalry between their families. In despair, they fled to the highest mountain on La Gomera, where they tragically ended their lives together. This mountain now bears their combined names: Garajonay[1][4].

The name "Garajonay" specifically refers to the highest point in the park, a large rock formation with an elevation of 1,487 meters (4,869 feet)[2]. This rock formation gave its name to the entire national park when it was established in 1981[2][4].

It's worth noting that while La Gomera is of volcanic origin, there is no specific volcano named Garaja associated with the park's naming.
