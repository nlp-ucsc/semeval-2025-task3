The provided answer is incorrect and contains several factual errors. Here are the correct details about the El Al Flight 402 crash:

El Al Flight 402 crashed on July 27, 1955, not December 19, 1961[1][10]. The aircraft involved was a Lockheed Constellation, not a Boeing 707-121[1][10]. The flight was traveling from London to Tel Aviv via Vienna and Istanbul, not from Rome to Tel Aviv[1][10]. The crash occurred near Petrich, Bulgaria, after the plane was shot down by Bulgarian MiG-15 jet fighters, not due to a collision with Mount Sinai during an instrument approach[1][10].

Regarding the number of casualties, all 58 people on board were killed, including 7 crew members and 51 passengers[1][10]. There were no reported deaths on the ground. Therefore, the total number of people killed in the El Al Flight 402 crash was 58, not 61[1][10].
