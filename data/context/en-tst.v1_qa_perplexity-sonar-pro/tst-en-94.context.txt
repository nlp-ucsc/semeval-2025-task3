Based on the search results provided, I can fact-check and provide a more accurate answer regarding the filmmakers who influenced Sergei Parajanov:

Sergei Parajanov, a renowned Soviet filmmaker, was influenced by several notable directors and artistic movements:

1. Andrei Tarkovsky: Parajanov considered Tarkovsky's film "Ivan's Childhood" (1962) as a major turning point in his career, calling Tarkovsky a "genius" and his teacher[5][10].

2. Sergei Eisenstein: Parajanov was influenced by Eisenstein's work, particularly in developing his own visual language using tableaux vivants[10].

3. Pier Paolo Pasolini: Along with Eisenstein, Pasolini's work inspired Parajanov's visual style[10]. Parajanov described Pasolini as "like a God" to him and a director of "majestic style"[1].

4. Federico Fellini: The Italian filmmaker was a fan of Parajanov's work, and there's evidence of mutual admiration between them[2].

5. Ukrainian filmmakers: Parajanov studied under Ukrainian directors Igor Savchenko and Oleksandr Dovzhenko at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography[1].

It's important to note that Parajanov's style evolved significantly over time. He abandoned socialist realism after being inspired by Tarkovsky's "Ivan's Childhood" and developed his own unique visual language[1][5]. His work also drew heavily from various cultural influences, including Armenian, Georgian, and Ukrainian traditions[1][3].

While the search results don't mention some of the influences listed in the original answer (such as Marcel Duchamp, Rene Magritte, or specific art movements), they do confirm Parajanov's interest in folk culture, multicultural elements, and his innovative approach to filmmaking[3].
