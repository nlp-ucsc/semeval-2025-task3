The provided answer is incorrect and significantly overestimates the population of Lautersheim. Based on the most recent available data:

1. According to the Wikipedia page for Lautersheim, the population was 622 as of December 31, 2022[8].

2. The City Population website reports a population of 628 for Lautersheim in 2022, based on census data[9].

3. The official German statistical data from Destatis does not provide a specific figure for Lautersheim, as it is too small to be listed individually in their population tables[2][4].

4. An older source (Wikipedia in German) gives a population of 607 as of December 31, 2023, though this may not be the most up-to-date figure[7].

These sources consistently show that Lautersheim has a population of around 600-630 people, which is significantly lower than the 1,200 figure mentioned in the original answer. The claim that the population was approximately 1,200 as of December 31, 2019, is not supported by any of the available data.

For the most accurate and current population figure, contacting local authorities or the German Statistical Office directly would indeed be the best approach, as population numbers for small villages can fluctuate and may not always be immediately updated in publicly available sources.
