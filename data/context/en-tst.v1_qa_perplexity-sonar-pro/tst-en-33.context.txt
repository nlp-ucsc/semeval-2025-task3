The provided answer about Alfred Plé is incorrect. Here is the accurate information:

Alfred Plé was famous for rowing, not swimming, in the Olympic Games[1][4]. Specifically:

1. Alfred Plé was a French rower who competed in the double sculls event[1][4].

2. He won a bronze medal in the double sculls at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium, partnering with Gaston Giran[1][4][7].

3. Plé only won one Olympic medal, not eleven as claimed in the incorrect answer[1][4][7].

4. He represented France in rowing at the 1920 and 1924 Summer Olympics[1].

5. In addition to his Olympic achievement, Plé and Giran won the European title in double sculls in 1920[4].

Alfred Plé's Olympic career was focused solely on rowing, particularly in the double sculls event. There is no evidence of him competing in or winning medals for swimming at the Olympic Games.
