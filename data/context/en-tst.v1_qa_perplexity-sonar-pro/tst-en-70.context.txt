The provided answer is incorrect. Sant'Isidoro a Capo le Case is not located in Sicily, but in Rome, Italy. More importantly, it does have notable cloisters.

According to the search results, Sant'Isidoro a Capo le Case has two cloisters:

1. The small cloister (il piccolo chiostro), designed by Casoni in 1626[5].

2. The Wadding cloister, named after Luke Wadding, which features 17th century murals[5].

The main cloister, called the Wadding Cloister, was built in 1630 and is located to the north-west of the church. It has arcades on all four sides and contains fresco cycles by Fra Giovanni Antonio Sguary, depicting portraits of Franciscan saints and scenes from the life of St Francis[1].

The smaller Spanish Cloister, built for the original Spanish friars, is located to the south of the main cloister and to the west of the church. It is described as possibly the smallest convent cloister in Rome and contains an old well[1].

Therefore, the correct answer is that Sant'Isidoro a Capo le Case has two cloisters.
