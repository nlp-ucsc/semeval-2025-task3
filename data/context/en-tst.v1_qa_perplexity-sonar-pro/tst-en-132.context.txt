Based on the search results, there were indeed other Kalanga-speaking kingdoms aside from the kingdom of Great Zimbabwe. The answer provided is partially correct but incomplete. Here's a more comprehensive response:

The Kalanga people established multiple kingdoms and states throughout history, not just the kingdom of Great Zimbabwe. Some key Kalanga-speaking kingdoms and states include:

1. Mapungubwe Kingdom: The Kalanga, along with the Venda and Bolubedu, are believed to have established the kingdom of Mapungubwe around 1075-1220 AD near the confluence of the Limpopo Rivers[9].

2. Great Zimbabwe: The Kalanga were involved in the establishment and rule of Great Zimbabwe between AD1200 and 1500[1].

3. Togwa-Buhwa (Butua) Kingdom: After breaking away from the Mutapa kingdom, the Kalanga and Venda established the Togwa-Buhwa (Butua) kingdom at Khami (also known as Kame-Khami ruins). This kingdom flourished between 1450 and around 1680[9].

4. Torwa State: After the collapse of Great Zimbabwe, the Kalanga moved westward and established the Torwa State, which reigned at Khami[1].

5. Rozvi Empire: In the 17th century, the Rozvi, who were southern Kalanga, became a powerful competitor in the region[5].

These various kingdoms and states demonstrate that the Kalanga-speaking people had a significant presence and influence in the region beyond just the kingdom of Great Zimbabwe. The Kalanga civilization was widespread and established multiple centers of power throughout its history in what is now Zimbabwe, Botswana, and parts of South Africa[7][9].
