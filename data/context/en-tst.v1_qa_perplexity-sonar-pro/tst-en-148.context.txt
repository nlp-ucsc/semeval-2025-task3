The provided answer is incorrect. According to multiple reliable sources:

Karen Percy (now Karen Percy Lowe) was made a Member of the Order of Canada in 1988[1][7][10]. Specifically:

1. The Canadian Encyclopedia states she "was made a Member of the Order of Canada in 1988"[4].

2. The Canadian Ski Hall of Fame and Museum notes "In 1988, she was a recipient Canada's highest award when she became a Member of the Order of Canada"[7].

3. Her Wikipedia page also confirms "In 1988, she was a recipient of Canada's highest award when she became a Member of the Order of Canada"[10].

The correct name is Karen Percy (later Karen Percy Lowe), not Karen Elizabeth Perky. Additionally, she received this honor in 1988, not 2018 as claimed in the provided answer. The recognition came in the same year as her Olympic medal wins at the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics[1][4].
