The statement that "The earliest known collages are from the 5th century BC, in the form of wall paintings in Pompeii" is incorrect. Here's the accurate history of collage techniques:

Collage techniques can be traced back much further than the 5th century BC and did not originate in Pompeii. The earliest known use of collage techniques dates back to 200 BC in China, following the invention of paper[4]. However, collage as an art form didn't gain widespread popularity until the 10th century in Japan, when calligraphers began applying glued paper with text on surfaces for writing poems[4].

In Europe, collage techniques appeared during the 13th century, with gold leaf panels being made for Gothic Cathedrals in the 15th and 16th centuries[4]. A notable early practitioner was Mary Delany, an English artist born in 1700, who at the age of 72 began creating over 900 works of paper mosaic art, which would later be known as collage[4].

The term "collage" as we know it today, however, was coined in the early 20th century by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso[1][7]. While they didn't invent the technique, they popularized it as part of the avant-garde art movement, with Braque creating what many consider the first modern artistic collage, "Still life BACH," in 1912[1].

It's important to note that the wall paintings in Pompeii, while significant in the history of art, are not considered collages. They are frescoes, a different painting technique where pigment is applied to wet plaster[2][3]. The Pompeian wall paintings date back to the 1st century BCE to 79 CE and are classified into four distinct styles by art historian August Mau[2][3].
