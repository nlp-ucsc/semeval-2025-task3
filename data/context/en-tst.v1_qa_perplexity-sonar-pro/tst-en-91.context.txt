The correct answer is that Lieutenant General William Howe was the British commander during the Battle of Long Island on August 27, 1776. This can be verified from multiple search results:

1. Lieutenant General William Howe led the British forces in the Battle of Long Island[1][5].

2. General William Howe commanded the British and Hessian troops against General George Washington and the American Continental Army[9].

3. Sir William Howe was the commander of the British forces at the Battle of Long Island[5].

4. By mid-August, Brigadier General William Howe had amassed about 40,000 British soldiers and sailors on more than 400 ships near Staten Island[6].

5. General Howe began transporting his men from Staten Island to Long Island on August 22[2].

The search results consistently identify William Howe as the British commander, with no mention of a commander named Robertson leading the British forces during this battle. The original answer is incorrect in suggesting there was confusion about a commander named Robertson.
