I apologize, but I do not have enough reliable information to fact-check or provide the perihelion of asteroid 661 Cloelia. The search results do not contain specific data about this asteroid's perihelion distance. While some orbital parameters are provided, such as its orbital period of 5.24 years[1], the perihelion distance is not mentioned. To accurately fact-check or provide this information, we would need access to more detailed astronomical databases or calculations that are not available in the given search results. Without verifiable data, I cannot confirm or refute any claims about 661 Cloelia's perihelion.
