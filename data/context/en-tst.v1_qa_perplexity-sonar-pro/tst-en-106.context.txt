The answer that James Bond drives an Aston Martin V12 Vanquish in Skyfall is incorrect. 

James Bond drives an Aston Martin V12 Vanquish in the 2002 film **Die Another Day**[1][7]. This was the 20th film in the James Bond franchise and starred Pierce Brosnan as 007. The Vanquish featured prominently in the film, equipped with various gadgets including an adaptive camouflage system that could make the car invisible[1]. 

The car was used in a memorable chase sequence on a frozen lake in Iceland, where Bond battled against the villain Zao driving a Jaguar XKR[1][7]. 

In Skyfall, which was released in 2012 and starred Daniel Craig as Bond, the featured Aston Martin was actually the classic DB5 model, not the V12 Vanquish[2][5]. The DB5 has appeared in multiple Bond films over the decades, starting with Goldfinger in 1964[2].
