I cannot confirm that Jonas Gahr Støre is the mayor of Jonquery. The information provided in the search results does not contain any details about the mayor of Jonquery. Jonas Gahr Støre is actually the Prime Minister of Norway, not the mayor of a French commune[2][4][8]. The search results do not provide any information about who the current mayor of Jonquery is or when they were elected. Jonquery appears to be a commune in France[7][9], but there are no details given about its local government or leadership. Therefore, the claim that Jonas Gahr Støre is the mayor of Jonquery elected in 2013 is incorrect based on the available information.
