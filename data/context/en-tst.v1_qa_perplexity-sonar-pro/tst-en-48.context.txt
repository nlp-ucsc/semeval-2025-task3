The statement "Delta, BC was incorporated on July 1, 1905" is incorrect. 

Delta, British Columbia was actually incorporated much earlier, on November 10, 1879[1][2][5][7]. This date is consistently mentioned across multiple reliable sources, including the official Delta city website and historical records.

Some key points to note:

1. Delta was originally incorporated as a district municipality in 1879, not as a city[4].

2. It was known as the "Corporation of Delta" for most of its history[1][4].

3. The change from "Corporation of Delta" to "City of Delta" occurred relatively recently, on September 22, 2017[1][2].

4. The incorporation in 1879 established Ladner as Delta's administrative center[5][7][8].

5. The year 1905 does not appear to have any particular significance in Delta's incorporation history based on the available search results.

In conclusion, the correct incorporation date for Delta, British Columbia is November 10, 1879, not July 1, 1905 as stated in the original claim.
