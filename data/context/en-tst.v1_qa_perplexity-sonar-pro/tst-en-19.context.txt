Not all fodies are red. While the most well-known species, the Red Fody (Foudia madagascariensis), has bright red plumage in breeding males, there is significant variation in coloration among fody species and between sexes[1][8].

Key points to consider:

1. Sexual dimorphism: In many fody species, only breeding males display bright red coloration. Females and non-breeding males typically have more subdued olive-brown or olive-green plumage[1][6][8].

2. Seasonal changes: Some fody species undergo seasonal color changes. For example, male Red Fodies molt from brown to bright red during the breeding season[4][8].

3. Species variation: Different fody species have distinct colorations. For instance, the Forest Fody (Foudia omissa) has olive-green plumage with some red areas in breeding males[6].

4. Non-red coloration: Fodies can display various colors besides red. Common colors include olive-green, brown, and yellow, especially in females and non-breeding males[1][6][8].

5. Juvenile plumage: Young fodies often have washed brown upperparts, differing from adult coloration[6].

In conclusion, while red is a prominent color in some fody species, particularly in breeding males, it is inaccurate to state that all fodies are red. The coloration varies significantly based on species, sex, age, and breeding status.
