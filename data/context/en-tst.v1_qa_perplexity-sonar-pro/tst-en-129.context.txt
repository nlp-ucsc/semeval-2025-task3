The provided answer is incorrect. The hole-in-the-head frog does not belong to the genus Hyla, nor is it called the common toad. Here are the correct facts:

The hole-in-the-head frog (Huia cavitympanum) belongs to the genus Huia[1][4][7]. It is the only member of this genus[1]. The species name cavitympanum refers to its distinctive recessed eardrums on the side of its skull[1].

Some key points:

1. Genus: Huia (not Hyla)
2. Species: cavitympanum
3. Full scientific name: Huia cavitympanum
4. Common name: Hole-in-the-head frog (not common toad)

The frog is found on the island of Borneo and inhabits subtropical or tropical moist forests and torrential rivers[1][7]. It is notable for being the only known frog species to vocalize exclusively at ultrasonic frequencies, likely an adaptation to its noisy waterfall habitat[1].
