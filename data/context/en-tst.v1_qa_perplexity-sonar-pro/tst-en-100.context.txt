The provided answer is incorrect. According to reliable sources, Liu Wenhui did study at a formal military academy:

Liu Wenhui studied at the Baoding Military Academy, graduating in 1916[1][4]. The Baoding Military Academy was a modern military institution established during the late Qing dynasty reforms. It was known as China's first formal institution for higher military training[2].

Specifically:

1. Liu Wenhui was born in 1895 in Dayi County, Sichuan[1].

2. He studied at the Baoding Military Academy and graduated in 1916[1][4].

3. The Baoding Military Academy was also known by other names during the late Qing reform period, including the Beiyang Army Military Quick-Course School and the Military Officers' School[2].

4. After graduating in 1916, Liu Wenhui returned to Sichuan and began his military career, serving as a staff officer in the Sichuan Army[1][4].

So contrary to the provided answer, Liu Wenhui did receive formal military education at an established academy, rather than just through experience and self-study. The Baoding Military Academy was a modern institution created as part of China's efforts to reform and modernize its military training in the early 20th century.
