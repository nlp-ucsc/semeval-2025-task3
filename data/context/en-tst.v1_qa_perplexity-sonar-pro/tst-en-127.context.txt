The Infiniti G Line is indeed manufactured by Nissan Motor Company[1][3]. Infiniti is the luxury vehicle division of Nissan, established in 1989 to compete with other Japanese luxury brands like Lexus and Acura[7]. The Infiniti brand was created as part of Nissan's "Horizon Task Force" project in 1985 to develop a new luxury performance automotive brand[3]. 

Specifically:

1. Infiniti is owned by and is a division of Nissan Motor Co.[3][6]

2. The Infiniti G Line has been produced from 1990 to 2016 across four generations[1].

3. Early generations of the G Line (G20) were based on the Nissan Primera[1].

4. Later generations (starting with the third generation V35) were rebadged versions of the Nissan Skyline[1].

5. While Infiniti's headquarters are in Japan, many models including some G Line vehicles have been manufactured in North America[6].

So the statement "The Infinity G-Line is manufactured by the Nissan Motor Company" is accurate, as Infiniti is Nissan's luxury brand and division responsible for producing the G Line of vehicles.
