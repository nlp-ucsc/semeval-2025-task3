The provided answer is incorrect. According to the search results, Peter Iwers played in a band called Chameleon before joining In Flames, not Necrodeath[1]. The search results do not mention any connection between Peter Iwers and Necrodeath. In fact, Necrodeath appears to be a separate Italian death/thrash metal band with no apparent connection to Peter Iwers or In Flames[5][8].

To provide the correct information:

Peter Iwers played in a band called Chameleon before joining In Flames in 1999[1]. He was a member of In Flames from their 1999 album "Colony" until their 2016 album "Battles", replacing Johan Larsson who had departed after the 1997 album "Whoracle"[1].
