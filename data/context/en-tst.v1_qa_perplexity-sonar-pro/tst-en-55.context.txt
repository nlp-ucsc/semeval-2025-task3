This answer is incorrect. The Pasteur lunar crater is indeed named after Louis Pasteur, the famous French chemist and microbiologist.

The correct information is:

The Pasteur crater on the Moon is named after Louis Pasteur (1822-1895), the renowned French chemist, pharmacist, and microbiologist[1]. Louis Pasteur is famous for his groundbreaking work in the fields of vaccination, microbial fermentation, and pasteurization[2]. He is considered one of the founders of modern bacteriology and has been honored as the "father of bacteriology" and the "father of microbiology"[2].

The lunar crater Pasteur is a large impact crater approximately 233 kilometers in diameter, located on the far side of the Moon[1]. It belongs to the category of lunar features termed a walled plain[1]. The crater was named in honor of Louis Pasteur, recognizing his significant contributions to science and medicine[1][2].

There is no evidence of a scientist named Camille Alphonse Grenet-Bleuzenet de La Vernardiere Pasteur being associated with this lunar feature. The claim about this person being the namesake of the crater appears to be fabricated.
