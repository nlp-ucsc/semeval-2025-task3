The provided answer contains inaccuracies and requires correction:

The light cruiser Emden was not built in Kiel, Germany. According to the search results, there were actually two notable ships named Emden:

1. The original SMS Emden: This light cruiser was laid down at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Dockyard) in Danzig in 1906[1]. Danzig is now known as Gda≈Ñsk, Poland.

2. The second Emden: This was the first major German warship built after World War I. It was laid down on 8 December 1921 at the Reichsmarinewerft shipyard in Wilhelmshaven, Germany[4][7].

Neither of these ships was built in Kiel. The statement that "The Emdin light cruisers were built in the shipyards of the German Navy in Kiel, Germany" is incorrect. While Kiel was an important naval shipbuilding center for Germany, hosting facilities like Deutsche Werke Kiel[2], it was not the construction site for the Emden cruisers.
