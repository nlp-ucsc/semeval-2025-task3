The provided answer is partially incorrect. Mark Warner did enter the U.S. Senate in 2009, but he did not serve in the Virginia House of Delegates prior to becoming a senator.

To correct and expand on this:

Mark Warner was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2008 and took office in January 2009[1][4]. Prior to becoming a senator, Warner served as the 69th Governor of Virginia from 2002 to 2006[4]. He did not serve in the Virginia House of Delegates.

Warner's political career began with his involvement in state politics, including managing Douglas Wilder's successful 1989 gubernatorial campaign and serving as chair of the Virginia Democratic Party from 1993 to 1995[1]. He ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 1996 before being elected governor in 2001[1][4].

After his term as governor ended in 2006, Warner was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2008, succeeding retiring Senator John Warner (no relation)[1][4]. He has since been reelected in 2014 and 2020[4].
