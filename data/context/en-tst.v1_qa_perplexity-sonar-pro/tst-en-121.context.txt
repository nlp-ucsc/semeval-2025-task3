The answer provided is incorrect. Based on the information available in the search results, there is no mention of Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi (HJK Helsinki) having red as their away color. In fact, the search results do not provide any specific information about HJK's away colors.

The search results do, however, provide information about HJK's traditional home colors:

1. HJK's traditional kit colors have long been blue and white striped shirts with blue shorts and socks[1].

2. In 1909, the colors blue and white were chosen to support the fennoman movement[1].

3. The club's first kit was a plain white shirt, black shorts, and black socks with a few white horizontal stripes on top[1].

4. In 1909, HJK introduced its trademark blue and white striped shirt[1].

It's important to note that while the search results provide detailed information about HJK's home colors and their history, they do not mention the club's away colors. Therefore, we cannot confirm or provide information about HJK's away colors based on the given search results.
