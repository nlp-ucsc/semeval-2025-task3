The answer provided is incorrect. According to the search results, the bony walls of the orbital canal in humans are derived from seven embryologically distinct structures, not six as stated in the answer to be fact-checked[1].

The correct seven bones that form the orbit are:

1. Zygomatic bone (laterally)
2. Sphenoid bone (lesser wing forming the optic canal and greater wing forming the lateral posterior portion)
3. Maxillary bone (inferiorly and medially)
4. Lacrimal bone (medially)
5. Ethmoid bone (medially)
6. Frontal bone (superior bony margin of the orbital rim)
7. Palatine bone (minute orbital process)[1][2]

The answer to be fact-checked correctly identified the frontal, zygomatic, sphenoid, ethmoid, maxilla, and palatine bones. However, it missed the lacrimal bone, which is an important component of the medial wall of the orbit[1]. 

It's worth noting that each of these bones contributes to different parts of the orbit:

- The roof is primarily formed by the frontal bone and the lesser wing of the sphenoid[1][2].
- The floor is formed by the maxilla, zygomatic, and palatine bones[1][2].
- The medial wall is formed by the ethmoid, maxilla, lacrimal, and sphenoid bones[1][2].
- The lateral wall is formed by the zygomatic bone and the greater wing of the sphenoid[1][2].

This complex arrangement of bones creates a protective cavity for the eye and its associated structures, while also providing openings for nerves and blood vessels to enter and exit the orbit.
