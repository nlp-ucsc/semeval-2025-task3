The statement that "The dye was developed by a chemist named Ewald Klein in the 1930s" is incorrect. 

International Klein Blue (IKB) was actually developed by French artist Yves Klein in collaboration with Edouard Adam, a Parisian art paint supplier, in the late 1950s[1][5]. Yves Klein, not Ewald Klein, was the creator of this distinctive deep blue hue. The development took place in the late 1950s, not the 1930s as claimed in the statement to be fact-checked[1][5].

IKB uses ultramarine pigment suspended in a synthetic resin binder called Rhodopas M or M60A, which was developed by the French pharmaceutical company Rhône-Poulenc[1]. This formulation allowed the pigment to retain its brilliance and intensity, which was often lost when mixed with traditional binders like linseed oil[2].

In May 1960, Klein registered the paint formula under the name International Klein Blue (IKB) at the Institut national de la propriété industrielle (INPI) in France[1]. While Klein did not patent IKB, he did patent a method for applying the color to various surfaces in March 1960[1].
