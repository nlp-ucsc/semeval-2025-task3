The Bundesautobahn 73 (BAB 73 or A 73) is approximately 170 km (110 mi) long[1]. This is significantly different from the Bundesstraße 73 (B73), which is a separate road. The Bundesautobahn 73 connects Suhl to Nuremberg and runs through the German states of Bavaria and Thuringia[1]. It is important to note that the Bundesautobahn 73 (A 73) should not be confused with the Bundesstraße 73 (B73), which is a different road running from Cuxhaven to Hamburg with a length of about 100 km (62 mi)[4].
