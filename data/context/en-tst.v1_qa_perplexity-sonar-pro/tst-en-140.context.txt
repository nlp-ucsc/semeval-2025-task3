The statement "Susan is played by Felicity Huffman" is incorrect. 

Susan Delfino (n√©e Bremmer, formerly Mayer) is played by Teri Hatcher in the ABC television series Desperate Housewives[1][4]. Teri Hatcher portrayed Susan for the entire run of the series, from its pilot episode on October 3, 2004, to the series finale on May 13, 2012[1].

Felicity Huffman, while also a star of Desperate Housewives, played a different character - Lynette Scavo[2][3]. Huffman and Hatcher were both part of the main cast, but they portrayed separate characters.

To clarify:
- Susan Delfino/Mayer: Played by Teri Hatcher
- Lynette Scavo: Played by Felicity Huffman

Teri Hatcher won a Golden Globe Award in 2005 for her performance as Susan[7][10], further confirming her role as this character.
