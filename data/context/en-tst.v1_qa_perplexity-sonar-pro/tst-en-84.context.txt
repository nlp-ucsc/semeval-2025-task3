Yes, there are museums in and around Altadena, California. However, some of the information in the previous answer is incorrect or unverified. Here are the confirmed museums:

1. The Bunny Museum: This was a unique museum in Altadena dedicated to rabbits. Unfortunately, it was destroyed by the Eaton Fire in January 2025. Prior to the fire, it housed over 40,550 rabbit-related items and held the Guinness World Record for the "Largest Collection of Rabbit Related Items"[1][8].

2. The Gamble House: While not in Altadena, this National Historic Landmark is located nearby in Pasadena. It's an excellent example of American Craftsman architecture, designed by Greene & Greene in 1908[3][7].

3. Other museums: The search results mention that there are over 18 museums in and around Altadena, but specific details about these are not provided[2].

It's important to note that Lacy Park, mentioned in the previous answer, is actually located in San Marino, not Altadena. While it's a beautiful 30-acre park, there's no mention of a museum there in the provided search results[6].

The California Institute of Technology (Caltech), the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, and the Griffith Observatory, while notable institutions, are not in Altadena and are not mentioned in the provided search results in relation to Altadena's museums.
