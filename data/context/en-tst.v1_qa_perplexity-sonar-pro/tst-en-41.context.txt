The answer provided is incorrect. Chassagnes is not located in the Jura region of eastern France. Based on the search results, Chassagnes is actually located in the Ardèche department in southern France[10]. Specifically, it is described as being "in the southern Ardèche, very close to the impressive gorges of Chassezac and the wood of Païolive"[10]. The Ardèche is part of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in south-central France, not the Jura region in eastern France.
