The given answer is incorrect. The Virginia Cavaliers' mascot is not a small dog breed or a cavapoo. Here are the correct facts about the Virginia Cavaliers' mascot:

The Virginia Cavaliers' mascot is called Cavman[1][5]. Cavman is a costumed character mascot that debuted during the 1984 football season and remains the official mascot of the Virginia Cavaliers[5][7]. 

Key points about Cavman:

1. Cavman is a human mascot dressed as a cavalier, not a dog breed[1][4].

2. The character stands over 6 feet tall and wears a cape, blue boots, white gloves, and has the Virginia sabre logo across his chest[4].

3. Cavman performs at football, men's basketball, and women's basketball games, as well as other university events[5][7].

4. The Cavman costume is worn by students selected through open tryouts[5][7].

5. In addition to the costumed Cavman, there is also a mounted Cavalier on horseback who leads the Virginia football team onto the field at home games[1][7].

The cavapoo mentioned in the given answer is an unrelated dog breed that is a cross between a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and a Poodle[3]. This breed has no connection to the University of Virginia's mascot.
