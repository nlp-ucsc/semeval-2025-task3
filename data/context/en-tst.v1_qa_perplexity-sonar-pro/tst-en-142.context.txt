The statement that Black Sabbath's "The Eternal Idol" was released in 1970 is incorrect. 

The Eternal Idol was actually released in November 1987 in the UK and on December 8, 1987 in the US[1][4]. This was Black Sabbath's 13th studio album and the first to feature vocalist Tony Martin[4]. It came much later in the band's career, nearly two decades after their self-titled debut album which was released in 1970[3].

To provide additional context:

1. Black Sabbath's debut album was released on February 13, 1970[3].
2. The Eternal Idol was released in late 1987, marking a different era for the band[1][4].
3. It was produced during a tumultuous period for Black Sabbath, with multiple lineup changes[7].
4. The album spent six weeks on the Billboard 200 chart, peaking at number 168[4].

Therefore, the original statement confuses the release date of The Eternal Idol with the band's much earlier works from 1970.
