The information provided in the given answer is incorrect. Based on the search results, I can provide the correct information:

HMY Britannia, the former Royal Yacht of Queen Elizabeth II, is permanently berthed at Ocean Terminal in Leith, Edinburgh, Scotland[1][3][5][6][7][8][9]. The yacht was decommissioned in 1997 and has been open to the public as a visitor attraction since then[3][6]. It welcomes over 390,000 visitors annually[7] and is consistently rated as one of the top tourist attractions in the UK[1][3]. 

The yacht is not located in Aberdeen Harbour, nor was it ever berthed in Southampton as suggested in the given answer. It has been in Edinburgh since its decommissioning, and there are no records of it being moved to other locations for public display. The Royal Yacht Britannia Trust owns and maintains the vessel in its current location[6][9].

Visitors can tour the five decks of the yacht, exploring various areas including the State Apartments, the Crew's Quarters, and the Engine Room[1][5]. The yacht is open year-round (except for January 1 and December 25) with varying opening hours depending on the season[5][8].
