The claim that the sunbittern eats the fruit of Amyema quandang is incorrect. 

The mistletoebird (Dicaeum hirundinaceum) is actually the bird known to consume the fruit of Amyema quandang, also called the grey mistletoe[1][5]. 

Key facts:

- Amyema quandang is a species of mistletoe found in Australia[1].
- The fruit of Amyema quandang is consumed by mistletoebirds, who then disperse the seeds[1][5].
- Mistletoebirds are specialist frugivores that primarily eat mistletoe berries, with mistletoe fruit accounting for about 85% of their diet[5].

In contrast, the sunbittern:

- Is native to Central and South America, not Australia where Amyema quandang is found[2][3].
- Has a carnivorous diet consisting mainly of insects, small fish, amphibians, reptiles, and other small animals[2][3][6]. 
- Does not eat fruit as a significant part of its diet[2][3][6].

Therefore, the sunbittern does not eat the fruit of Amyema quandang. This mistletoe species is consumed and dispersed by the mistletoebird in Australia, not by the sunbittern which lives in a different part of the world and has a very different diet.
