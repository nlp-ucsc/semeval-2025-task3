The provided answer is incorrect. Cedric Liddell won an Olympic bronze medal in rowing at the 1932 Los Angeles Summer Olympics, not in 1952 as claimed[1][4]. He was part of the Canadian coxed eight team, not an American coxless four team[1][4]. The correct information is:

1. Year: Cedric Liddell won his Olympic bronze medal in 1932, not 1952[1][4].

2. Location: The Olympics where he won were held in Los Angeles, not Helsinki[1][4].

3. Event: He competed in the coxed eight event, not the coxless four[1][4].

4. Country: Liddell represented Canada, not the United States[1][4].

5. Placing: While it's correct that his team won bronze, the statement about finishing behind Switzerland and Canada is inaccurate. The specific placings of other teams in the 1932 coxed eight final are not provided in the given search results.

Additionally, it's worth noting that Cedric Liddell also competed in the 1936 Berlin Olympics in the same event (coxed eight), where his team finished 9th[4].
