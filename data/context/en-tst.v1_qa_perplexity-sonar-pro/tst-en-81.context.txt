The claim that there are approximately 30 to 35 recognized species in the Agastache genus is not accurate based on the provided search results. According to the most reliable sources:

Agastache contains 22 species, mainly native to North America, with one species native to eastern Asia[1][2]. This number is consistently mentioned in multiple sources:

1. Wikipedia states: "It contains 22 species, mainly native to North America, one species native to eastern Asia."[1]

2. North Carolina State University Extension confirms: "This is a Genus of about 22 species of herbaceous perennials in the mint family (Lamiaceae) and most are native to North America and many from the southwest and Mexico."[5]

3. The USDA's Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey (CAPS) database also lists Agastache as a genus[8], supporting its recognized taxonomic status.

The search results provide a detailed list of these species, divided into two sections: Agastache and Brittonastrum[1]. This classification is more specific and authoritative than the claim of 30-35 species.

It's worth noting that the number of species in a genus can sometimes vary slightly depending on taxonomic interpretations, but the consistent mention of 22 species across multiple reliable sources suggests this is the most accurate count for Agastache.
