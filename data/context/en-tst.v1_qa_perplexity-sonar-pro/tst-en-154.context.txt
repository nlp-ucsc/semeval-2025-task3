The claim that "The Theanists were a group of students at the University of Athens who met in the late 19th century to discuss the teachings of the Greek poet Sappho" is incorrect and contains several inaccuracies. Here is the correct information:

Theano belonged to the Pythagorean school of philosophy in ancient Greece, not a 19th-century group at the University of Athens. The key facts are:

1. Theano was associated with the Pythagorean school founded by Pythagoras in the 6th century BC[1][3].

2. She is often described as either the wife or student of Pythagoras himself[9].

3. The Pythagorean school was located in Croton, southern Italy (Magna Graecia), not Athens[5][7].

4. Theano reportedly continued to run the Pythagorean school after Pythagoras' death in the late 6th/early 5th century BC[5][7].

5. The Pythagorean school focused on mathematics, philosophy, and scientific inquiry, not on studying the poetry of Sappho[1][3].

6. While Sappho was a renowned ancient Greek poet, she lived around 600 BC and was not directly associated with the Pythagorean school or Theano's teachings[2][4].

In summary, Theano was a 6th century BC Pythagorean philosopher, not the leader of a 19th-century study group focused on Sappho. The original claim conflates different historical periods and misrepresents the nature of Theano's philosophical affiliation.
