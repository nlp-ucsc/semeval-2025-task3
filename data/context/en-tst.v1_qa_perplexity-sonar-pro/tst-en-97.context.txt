The provided answer contains some inaccuracies and omissions. Here's a fact-checked response:

Yes, the album "Brothers in Arms" by Dire Straits won several awards, but not all of those mentioned in the given answer are correct. Here are the accurate awards:

1. Grammy Awards: In 1986, it won the Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical[6][7]. It was also nominated for Album of the Year but did not win[6].

2. Brit Awards: It won Best British Album at the 1987 Brit Awards, not 1986 as stated[6].

3. The album's 20th Anniversary Edition won another Grammy in 2006 for Best Surround Sound Album[6].

4. It won the Juno Award for Best Selling International Album in 1986[6].

5. Rolling Stone magazine did include it in their list of "500 Greatest Albums of All Time", but its ranking has changed over time. In the 2020 revision, it was ranked at number 418, not 247[6].

The answer incorrectly states that it won Best Pop Album and an American Music Award, which are not mentioned in the provided search results. Additionally, there's no information in the search results about an MTV Video Music Award for Best Stage Performance Video.

It's worth noting that while the album itself didn't win an MTV Video Music Award, the music video for "Money for Nothing" from this album won "Best Group Video" and "Video of the Year" at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards[1].
