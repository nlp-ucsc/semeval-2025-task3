The provided answer is incorrect. Here are the correct facts about Agistri's location:

Agistri is not located in the city of Athens, but is a separate island in Greece. Specifically:

1. Agistri is a small island located in the Saronic Gulf of Greece[1][2][4].

2. It is situated approximately 24 nautical miles from Athens[4].

3. The closest island to Agistri is Aegina, which is about 4 nautical miles away[4].

4. Agistri can be reached by ferry or high-speed boat from the port of Piraeus near Athens. The journey takes about 55 minutes to 1.5 hours depending on the type of boat[5].

5. Agistri is part of the Saronic Islands group[1][2].

6. The island has an area of about 13.367 square kilometers (5.161 square miles)[1].

So in summary, Agistri is a small Greek island in the Saronic Gulf, close to but separate from Athens, not located within the city itself as the original answer incorrectly stated.
