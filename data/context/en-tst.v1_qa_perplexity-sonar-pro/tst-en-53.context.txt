The provided answer is incorrect and contains several inaccuracies about spotted blue-eyes. I will provide the correct information about their diet and feeding habits:

Spotted Blue-Eyes (Pseudomugil gertrudae) are small freshwater fish, not annelid worms as incorrectly stated. They are omnivorous and have the following dietary preferences:

## Diet

- Spotted Blue-Eyes accept high-quality flake food as part of their diet[1][4][7].
- They prefer meaty foods over dry food[1][4].
- Frozen foods like brine shrimp and bloodworms are recommended as part of their diet[1][4][7].
- Live baby brine shrimp can be offered, especially to fry[4].
- Small food particles are necessary due to their small mouths[1][4].

## Feeding Habits

- They are not particularly selective eaters[1].
- A varied diet is important for their health and to enhance their natural coloring[1].
- Small amounts should be fed at a time due to their small mouths[7].
- They will also nibble on algae and biofilm in the aquarium[9].

## Additional Notes

- For breeding, fry should initially be fed infusoria and vinegar eels before transitioning to baby brine shrimp[4].
- In the wild, they likely consume small invertebrates and zooplankton, though specific information on their natural diet is not provided in the search results.

The original answer incorrectly identified Spotted Blue-Eyes as worms and provided irrelevant information about earthworm diets. Spotted Blue-Eyes are fish that require a diet appropriate for small, omnivorous aquarium fish.
