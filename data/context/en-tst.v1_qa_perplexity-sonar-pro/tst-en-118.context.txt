The capital of Oudalan Province is not Ouagadougou. The correct capital of Oudalan Province is Gorom-Gorom[1][10].

Ouagadougou is actually the capital city of Burkina Faso, not of Oudalan Province[2][5]. Ouagadougou serves as the administrative, communications, cultural, and economic center of the entire nation of Burkina Faso[2][5].

Oudalan Province is one of the 45 provinces of Burkina Faso, located in its Sahel Region[1]. The province is divided into 5 departments, with Gorom-Gorom being both the capital of the province and one of its departments[1].

It's important to note that while Ouagadougou is the largest city in Burkina Faso with a population of over 2 million as of 2019[5], Gorom-Gorom, the capital of Oudalan Province, is much smaller. The entire Oudalan Province had a population of 158,146 people according to the 2019 census[1].
