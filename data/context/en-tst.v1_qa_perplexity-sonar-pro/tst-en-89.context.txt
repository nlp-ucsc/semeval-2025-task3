I apologize, but the provided answer appears to be incorrect based on the available search results. The correct information is:

Rosendorf is a municipality in the district Saale-Orla-Kreis, in Thuringia, Germany. According to search result [1], Rosendorf is a member of the municipal association Triptis. 

The answer incorrectly states that Rosendorf is part of Schönau an der Triesting in Austria. However, Schönau an der Triesting is a separate municipality in Lower Austria, as shown in search results [2] and [4], and is not associated with Rosendorf in Germany.

To summarize:
- Rosendorf is in Germany, not Austria
- It belongs to the municipal association of Triptis
- It is not part of Schönau an der Triesting, which is a different municipality in a different country
