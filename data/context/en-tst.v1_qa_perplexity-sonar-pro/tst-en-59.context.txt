The provided answer contains some inaccuracies. Let me provide the correct information:

Dourbies is indeed a commune in France, and it belongs to the Gard department[1][4]. Communes are the lowest level of administrative division in France, but they are indeed part of departments and regions[2][5].

Specifically:

1. Dourbies is a commune in the Gard department in southern France[4].

2. It is located in the Occitanie region[1].

3. The information about the canton of La Bastide-de-Solan and the Arrondissement of NÃ®mes is incorrect. According to available information, Dourbies is part of the canton of Le Vigan[10].

To summarize, Dourbies is a commune that belongs to the Gard department in the Occitanie region of France. The statement that communes are not part of any department or region directly is incorrect, as communes are indeed the basic administrative units within departments and regions in France.
