The provided answer is incorrect. The Tucumán mountain finch (Poospiza baeri) belongs to the genus Poospiza, not Platyspilus, and it is not a tinamou[1][3]. Here are the key facts to correct the misinformation:

1. The correct scientific name is Poospiza baeri, not Platyspilus leucostictus[1][3].

2. It is indeed a finch-like bird, specifically a tanager in the family Thraupidae, which is part of the order Passeriformes[1][3].

3. The Tucumán mountain finch is endemic to shrubby woodland in the Andes of north-western Argentina[1][3].

4. It is closely related to the Cochabamba mountain finch, and both are placed in the genus Poospiza[1][3].

5. The genus Poospiza contains several species of finch-like birds found in South America[2].

In summary, the Tucumán mountain finch is correctly classified as belonging to the genus Poospiza, not as a tinamou, and it is a passerine bird in the tanager family.
