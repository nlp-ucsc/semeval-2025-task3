The given answer is incorrect. Gergely Kulcsár did not compete in the men's hammer throw at the 1992 Summer Olympics. Here are the correct facts:

Gergely Kulcsár competed in the men's javelin throw at the Olympic Games[1][3][7]. He participated in four Olympic Games between 1960 and 1972[1][7]. Specifically:

1. He won a bronze medal in javelin throw at the 1960 Rome Olympics[1][2].
2. He won a silver medal in javelin throw at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics[1][2].
3. He won a bronze medal in javelin throw at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics[1][2].
4. He competed in javelin throw at the 1972 Munich Olympics, finishing 14th[1].

Kulcsár was a javelin thrower, not a hammer thrower, and his last Olympic appearance was in 1972, not 1992[1][7]. He was known for being the first Hungarian javelin thrower to reach 80 metres[1][5].
