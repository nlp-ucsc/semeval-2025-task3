The claim that Andreï Krivochkin started working on The Italian in 1995 is incorrect based on the available information.

According to the search results, the idea for The Italian actually started in 2000, not 1995[6]. Additionally, the director's name is Andrei Kravchuk, not Andreï Krivochkin[1][2]. 

The film was released in 2005[1][2], and Kravchuk was born in 1962[6], so he would have been in his late 30s when he began working on the project around 2000. This timeline aligns much more closely with the film's 2005 release date than a 1995 start date would.

Therefore, the correct information is that Andrei Kravchuk began working on The Italian around 2000, about 5 years before its release, not in 1995 as claimed in the statement to be fact-checked.
