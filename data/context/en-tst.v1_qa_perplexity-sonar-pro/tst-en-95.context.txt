I apologize, but the provided answer contains incorrect information. Based on the search results, I can provide the following accurate information about Stahlberg:

Stahlberg is not a district or part of Wismar. It is a separate municipality located in the Donnersbergkreis district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany[9]. The coordinates provided in the original answer are also incorrect.

According to the search results, there are two different sets of coordinates given for places named Stahlberg in Germany:

1. Latitude: 49.667, Longitude: 7.783 (or 49° 40' 00" N, 7° 47' 00" E)[2]
2. Latitude: 50.050, Longitude: 13.017 (or 50° 03' 00" N, 13° 01' 00" E)[6]

The first set of coordinates (49.667, 7.783) is more likely to be correct for the Stahlberg in Rhineland-Palatinate, as it is closer to the coordinates provided in the Wikipedia article (49°40′0″N 7°47′16″E)[9].

In conclusion, Stahlberg is a municipality in Rhineland-Palatinate, not a part of Wismar, and is not located on the Baltic Sea coast.
