The vocal cords and throat are indeed commonly associated with voice disorders, but a more comprehensive answer would include additional anatomical structures:

Voice disorders are primarily associated with the following parts of the body:

1. Vocal cords (vocal folds): These are two elastic bands of muscle tissue located in the larynx (voice box) that vibrate to produce sound[1][2]. Voice disorders can affect the vocal cords in various ways, such as paralysis, nodules, polyps, or inflammation[1][5].

2. Larynx (voice box): This structure houses the vocal cords and is crucial for voice production[2][8]. Disorders affecting the larynx, such as laryngitis or muscle tension dysphonia, can lead to voice problems[1][2].

3. Throat: While the throat is involved in voice production, it's more accurate to specify the pharynx and other resonating structures as part of the vocal tract[1].

4. Trachea (windpipe): Located below the larynx, the trachea supplies air from the lungs to the vocal cords[4].

5. Lungs: They provide the airflow necessary for voice production[8].

6. Nervous system: Some voice disorders, like spasmodic dysphonia, are neurological in nature and involve the nerves controlling the laryngeal muscles[1][9].

7. Muscles: Both intrinsic (within the larynx) and extrinsic (surrounding) muscles play a role in voice production and can be affected in voice disorders[2][6].

In summary, while the vocal cords and throat are indeed important, voice disorders can involve a complex interplay of various structures in the respiratory and nervous systems.
