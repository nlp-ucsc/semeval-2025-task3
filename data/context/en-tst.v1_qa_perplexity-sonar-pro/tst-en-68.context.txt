The answer provided is correct. There are indeed Fomitiporia species found outside of Africa. This can be verified based on the following information from the search results:

1. Fomitiporia mediterranea is found in Europe and Asia[1][2][3][7]. This species is particularly notable as a major cause of wood rot in grapevines in Europe[7].

2. Fomitiporia polymorpha is found in North America[2].

3. Fomitiporia australiensis is found in Australia[2].

4. Fomitiporia punctata has been reported in northern and northeastern temperate areas of North America, as well as in northern-central Europe and temperate Asia[6].

5. The genus Fomitiporia is described as "widely distributed" according to a 2008 estimate[5].

6. Fomitiporia torreyae and Fomitiporia punctata have been studied in Japan, indicating their presence in East Asia[9].

While the answer correctly identifies the global distribution of Fomitiporia, it's worth noting that some of the specific species mentioned (F. septica and F. parvispora) are not directly referenced in the provided search results. However, the overall claim that Fomitiporia species exist outside of Africa is strongly supported by the evidence.
