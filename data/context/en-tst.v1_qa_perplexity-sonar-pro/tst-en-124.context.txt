The statement "The Second Nicaean Council was held in 325" is incorrect.

The Second Council of Nicaea actually took place in 787 CE, not 325[1][6][7]. This council is also known as the Seventh Ecumenical Council and was held in Nicaea, present-day Ä°znik, Turkey[1]. 

The council that occurred in 325 CE was the First Council of Nicaea[3], which is a different event altogether. The First Council of Nicaea dealt with issues such as the Arian heresy and the calculation of Easter[3], while the Second Council of Nicaea, held over 460 years later, primarily addressed the issue of iconoclasm and approved the veneration of icons[1][7].

It's important to note that these two councils, despite sharing the name "Nicaea," were separate events held centuries apart and dealt with different theological matters.
