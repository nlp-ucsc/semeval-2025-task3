The statement that Ritsher Uplands was named in honor of R.A. Ritsch, a geologist who worked in the area, is incorrect.

Ritscher Upland was actually named after Alfred Ritscher, a German polar explorer and captain who led the third German Antarctic Expedition in 1938-39[1][3]. Alfred Ritscher was not a geologist, but rather a naval officer and explorer. 

Key facts about Alfred Ritscher and the naming of Ritscher Upland:

1. Alfred Ritscher lived from 1879 to 1963[1][3].

2. He was a Kapit√§n zur See (Captain at Sea) in the Kriegsmarine (German Navy)[1].

3. Ritscher led the third German Antarctic Expedition in 1938-39, which mapped parts of Queen Maud Land[1].

4. The expedition he led was responsible for mapping and naming geographical features in the area now known as New Swabia (Neuschwabenland)[1][3].

5. Ritscher Upland (also called Ritscher Hochland in German) was one of the areas discovered and named during this expedition[3].

6. The naming was in honor of Ritscher's role as the expedition leader, not for any work as a geologist[1][3].

7. Other geographical features in Antarctica, such as Ritscher Peak, are also named after him[1][3].

In conclusion, Ritscher Upland is named after Alfred Ritscher, a German polar explorer and expedition leader, not after a geologist named R.A. Ritsch as incorrectly stated in the original claim.
