The provided answer contains several inaccuracies regarding Catherine McCormack's birth and background:

Catherine McCormack was born on April 3, 1972 in Epsom, Surrey, England[1][5]. She is an English actress, not Irish[5]. The correct information about her birth is:

1. Date of birth: April 3, 1972 (not February 1, 1972)
2. Place of birth: Epsom, Surrey, England (not Belfast, Northern Ireland)
3. Nationality: English (not Irish)

Additionally, while the answer correctly mentions her role in Braveheart (1995), it incorrectly attributes roles to her from The Sheltering Sky (1990) and Plenty (1998), which are not listed among her known film credits[1][7].

Some of her actual notable roles include:
- Murron in Braveheart (1995)
- Elizabeth Hadley in Spy Game (2001)
- Sonia Rand in A Sound of Thunder (2005)[7]

Catherine McCormack did indeed begin her acting career in the 1990s, with her first professional role in the low-budget Australian film Loaded (1994)[4]. She has continued to work in film, television, and theater since then[1][7].
