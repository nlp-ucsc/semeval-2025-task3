I apologize, but the provided answer contains several inaccuracies and errors. Let me provide a corrected response based on the search results:

Yes, there are several noteworthy Anglo-Irish mathematicians who have made significant contributions to the field. Some of the most famous ones include:

1. Sir William Rowan Hamilton (1805-1865): An Irish mathematician who contributed to the development of optics, dynamics, and algebra, particularly discovering the algebra of quaternions[5]. He is considered Ireland's most renowned mathematician and mathematical physicist[9].

2. George Salmon (1819-1904): Born in Dublin and educated at Trinity College Dublin, he wrote numerous popular and influential books on higher level algebra and geometry[9][1].

3. Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet (1819-1903): Considered the most famous Irish mathematician according to the Pantheon ranking, with his biography translated into 51 different languages[1].

4. William Brouncker, 2nd Viscount Brouncker (1620-1684): An Anglo-Irish peer and mathematician who served as the president of the Royal Society from 1662 to 1677. He is best known for introducing Brouncker's formula[1].

5. Henry John Stephen Smith (1826-1883): An Irish mathematician remembered for his work in elementary divisors, quadratic forms, and the Smith–Minkowski–Siegel mass formula in number theory[1].

It's important to note that Pythagoras, Euclid, and John Wallis were not Anglo-Irish mathematicians. Pythagoras was Greek, Euclid was Greek (or possibly Egyptian), and John Wallis was English. James Joseph Sylvester, while a notable mathematician who worked on number theory, was English, not Irish.
