The provided answer that "Bahram I's reign was from 685 to 628 AD" is incorrect. 

Bahram I's actual reign was from 271 to 274 AD[1][3][7]. Specifically:

1. Bahram I succeeded his brother Hormizd I, who had reigned for only about a year in 270-271 AD[1].

2. Bahram I ascended to the throne in 271 AD[1][3].

3. His reign lasted until September 274 AD, when he died and was succeeded by his son Bahram II[1][8].

4. Multiple sources consistently place Bahram I's reign in the 3rd century AD, not the 7th century as the incorrect answer states[1][3][7].

5. The dates given in the incorrect answer (685-628 AD) are not only in the wrong century, but also chronologically impossible since the end date precedes the start date.

In summary, Bahram I reigned for approximately 3 years from 271 to 274 AD as the fourth Sasanian King of Kings of Iran[1][3]. The provided answer is off by over 400 years and does not match any historical records of Sasanian rulers.
