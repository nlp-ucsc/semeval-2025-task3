The provided answer is incorrect. Saint-Voir is actually located in the Allier department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region of central France[1][5]. The answer confuses Saint-Voir with Saint-Véran, which is a different commune located in the Hautes-Alpes department[3]. Additionally, Languedoc-Roussillon is no longer an administrative region, as it merged with Midi-Pyrénées in 2016 to form the new region of Occitania[4].

To clarify:
- Saint-Voir is in Allier, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes
- Saint-Véran is in Hautes-Alpes, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur
- The Pyrénées-Orientales department is now part of the Occitania region
