The Little Bamboo Rat (Typhlomys minutus) is a species of rodent in the family Platacanthomyidae. It is endemic to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. The Little Bamboo Rat is a relatively small rodent, named for its preference for bamboo habitats. It has a distinct, elongated body shape and is often found in areas with dense bamboo growth. The species is not considered to be threatened at the moment, but its habitat is dependent on the preservation of bamboo forests, making it somewhat sensitive to environmental changes.
