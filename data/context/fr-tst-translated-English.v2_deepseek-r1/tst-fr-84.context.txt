The First Council of Nicaea took place in the year **325 AD**. It was convened by Emperor Constantine the Great in Nicaea, which is modern-day Ä°znik, Turkey. This council is one of the most significant events in Christian history, as it addressed the Arian controversy and established the Nicene Creed, which affirmed the divinity of Jesus Christ and the concept of the Trinity.
