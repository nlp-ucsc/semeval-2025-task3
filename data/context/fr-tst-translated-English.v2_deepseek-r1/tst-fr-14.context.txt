The origins of the Emerging Church, also known as the Emerging Church Movement, are associated with several key pastors, writers, and theologians who sought to redefine and contextualize Christianity for a postmodern world. The movement emerged primarily in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Below are some of the most influential figures associated with the movement:

1. **Brian McLaren**: Often considered one of the most prominent voices of the Emerging Church, McLaren is a pastor, author, and speaker. His books, such as *The Church on the Other Side: Doing Ministry in the Postmodern Matrix* and *A New Kind of Christian*, have been influential in shaping the movement's ideas.

2. **Tony Jones**: Another significant figure, Jones has been a key leader in the Emerging Church. He served as the national coordinator of Emergent Village, one of the movement's main organizational expressions. His writings, including *The New Christians: Dispatches from the Emergent Frontier*, have contributed to the movement's dialogue.

3. **Doug Pagitt**: A pastor and author, Pagitt is known for his emphasis on postmodern spirituality and community. His book *Reimagining Spiritual Formation: A Conversation with J.R. Briggs* explores new approaches to spiritual growth within the Emerging Church context.

4. **Mark Driscoll**: Although Driscoll is more associated with the "Young, Restless, and Reformed" movement, his early work and the church he founded, Mars Hill Church, had connections to the Emerging Church. However, his Calvinist theology diverged from the more progressive elements of the Emerging Church, leading to some distancing.

5. **Rob Bell**: While not exclusively part of the Emerging Church, Bell's influence overlaps with the movement. His teachings on grace, love, and a more inclusive understanding of Christianity, as seen in his books like *Velvet Elvis* and *Love Wins*, resonate with many in the Emerging Church.

6. **Erwin McManus**: The pastor of Mosaic in Los Angeles, McManus is known for his focus on cultural engagement and creating a more relevant church experience. His books like *An Unstoppable Force* and *The Church in Emerging Culture* reflect this emphasis.

These leaders, among others, have played significant roles in shaping the theology, practices, and conversations within the Emerging Church Movement, which emphasizes dialogue, inclusivity, and a critique of traditional church structures.
