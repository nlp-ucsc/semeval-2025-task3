The main geographical asset of Turpan is its unique location in a fertile oasis in the Turpan Depression, which is the lowest point in China and the second-lowest in the world. This depression is surrounded by the Tian Shan mountains, creating a microclimate that allows for intensive agriculture, particularly the cultivation of grapes, which are used to produce famous wines, raisins, and other products. The oases in Turpan are supported by a network of karez, an ancient irrigation system that channels mountain water to the fields, making agriculture possible in this arid region.
