According to legend, Theano, who was the wife and student of the Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, had two children with him: a daughter named Damo and a son named Telauges. Additionally, she is sometimes credited with a second daughter named Arignote. However, it's important to note that the historical records about their children are not entirely consistent and may vary depending on the source. Nonetheless, Damo and Telauges are the most commonly mentioned children in the accounts.
