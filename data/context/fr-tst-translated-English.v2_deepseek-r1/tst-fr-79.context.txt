In Dan Brown's novel "Inferno," Bertrand Zobrist, a billionaire geneticist, creates a plague in an attempt to save humanity. He believes that the world is on the brink of catastrophic overpopulation and ecological collapse. To address this, Zobrist engineers a virus that is designed to render one-third of the global population infertile, thereby controlling population growth. His vision is to prevent the eventual collapse of society by intervening in the population crisis he foresee, though his methods are extreme and ethically questionable. However, it's important to note that Zobrist's actions are the central conflict of the story, and his solution is portrayed as controversial and morally complex.
