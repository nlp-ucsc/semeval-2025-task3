The Alpine belt began to form during the Late Cretaceous to Early Cenozoic, which is approximately 65 to 20 million years ago. This period saw significant tectonic activity due to the collision between the Eurasian and African tectonic plates, leading to the formation of the Alps and other mountain ranges in the region.
