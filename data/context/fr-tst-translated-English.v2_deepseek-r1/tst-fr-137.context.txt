The genus *Valerianella* actually belongs to the family **Valerianaceae**, not Caprifoliaceae. However, in some older classifications, Valerianaceae was sometimes included within a broader circumscription of Caprifoliaceae. 

Nowadays, most modern classifications, such as the **Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG)** system, recognize Valerianaceae as a distinct family within the order Dipsacales. Caprifoliaceae is a separate family within the same order but includes genera like *Viburnum*, *Sambucus* (elder), and *Loniera* (honeysuckle).

So, if you're referring to an older classification where Valerianaceae was included in Caprifoliaceae, then *Valerianella* would belong to the family Caprifoliaceae. But in current taxonomy, it belongs to Valerianaceae.
