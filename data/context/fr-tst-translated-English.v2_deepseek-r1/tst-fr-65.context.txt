The Alamanni, a group of Germanic tribes, believed in a form of Germanic paganism before they were Christianized. This involved the worship of a pantheon of deities similar to those in Norse mythology. They worshipped gods like Woden (Odin), Thor, and Donar, and their religious practices included offerings and sacrifices. The process of Christianization occurred primarily during the Merovingian and Carolingian periods, influenced by missionary efforts and Frankish rule.
