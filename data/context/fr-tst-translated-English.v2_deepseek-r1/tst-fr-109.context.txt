The discovery in 1965 considered a major breakthrough in observational cosmology was the detection of the **cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB)** by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson. This discovery provided strong evidence for the Big Bang theory and earned them the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1978. The CMB is the residual heat from the early universe, and its discovery confirmed predictions made by cosmologists regarding the universe's origins.
