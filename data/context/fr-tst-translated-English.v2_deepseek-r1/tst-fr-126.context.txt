The church **Sant'Isidoro a Capo le Case** in Rome, Italy was originally built in the 17th century. It was constructed for the **Discalced Trinitarians**, a Catholic religious order, and was dedicated to Saint Isidore the Laborer (San Isidoro), a Spanish saint who is often depicted as a simple farmer and a protector of laborers. The church was designed by the Italian architect **Domenico Castelli** and completed around **1622**. Over time, it has undergone several restorations and modifications, but it retains much of its original Baroque architecture and serves as a significant place of worship and historical interest in Rome.
