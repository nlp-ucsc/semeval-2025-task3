Count Carlo Gozzi was born on Decemeber 13, 1720. He was the brother of the famous Venetian playwright Carlo Gozzi. Carlo Gozzi joined the military at a young age, following the tradition of the Gozzi family who often pursued military careers. Unfortunately, I don't have information on the exact year or age when he enlisted in the army. If you need more detailed historical information, I recommend referring to specific historical documents or scholarly works that focus on the Gozzi family and their military histories.
