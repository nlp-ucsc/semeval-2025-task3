The event involving El Al Israel Airlines on July 27, 1955, was the mysterious crash of Flight 402, a Lockheed Constellation aircraft. The flight was en route from Vienna to Tel Aviv with a scheduled stopover in Istanbul. However, after departing Vienna, the aircraft mistakenly entered Bulgarian airspace due to navigational errors, possibly compounded by poor weather conditions.

Bulgarian Air Force MiG-15 fighters intercepted the El Al aircraft, leading to the shooting down of the Constellation. All 58 people on board, including passengers and crew, tragically lost their lives in this incident. This event marked one of the deadliest episodes in El Al's history and led to significant changes in international aviation protocols to prevent such tragic occurrences in the future. The reasons behind the interception were attributed to a combination of navigational mistakes by the pilots and overly aggressive measures taken by Bulgarian military forces.
