The Common Horse Chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) is often confused with the Sweet Chestnut (Castanea sativa). However, they are quite different trees. The Horse Chestnut has large, showy flowers that are white with a pink blush and produces round, spiny fruit contains that contain one or two large, shiny brown seeds with a small "eye." The Sweet Chestnut has smaller, yellowish flowers that are not as showy and produces long, spiny fruits that contain multiple smaller seeds, which are edible when roasted. Additionally, the leaves of the Horse Chestnut are larger and have fewer lobes than those of the Sweet Chestnut.
