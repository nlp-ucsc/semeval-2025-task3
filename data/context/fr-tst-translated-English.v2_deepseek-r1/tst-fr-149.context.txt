The town of Ożarów, located in Poland, historically had a significant Jewish community. Before World War II, Jews made up a substantial portion of the population and played an important role in the local economy and culture. Unfortunately, during the Holocaust, the Jewish community was devastated, and many of its members were killed or displaced. Today, there are few remnants of the once-thriving Jewish presence in Ożarów, though some historical sites and records serve as a reminder of this community's history.
