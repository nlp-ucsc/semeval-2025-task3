Chichester, a city located in West Sussex, England, has a rich history that dates back to the Roman era. The city was founded by the Romans around 43 AD, shortly after their conquest of Britain. The Romans established a settlement they called *Noviomagus Reginorum*, which translates to "new market place of the Regnenses." This settlement was strategically situated near the River Lavant and became an important center for trade and administration in the region.

During the Roman period, Chichester was equipped with typical Roman infrastructure, including a forum, basilica, public baths, and an amphitheater. The city's grid street pattern, which still exists today, was also laid out by the Romans. Over time, Chichester evolved from a Roman market town into a significant medieval city, with the construction of its famous cathedral in the 11th century further establishing its importance.

So, the occasion of Chichester's founding was the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century AD, specifically around 43 AD when the Romans established *Noviomagus Reginorum*. This marked the beginning of the city's long and storied history.
