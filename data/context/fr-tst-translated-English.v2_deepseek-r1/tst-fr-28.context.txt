Timegate Studios developed two expansions for the original F.E.A.R. game:

1. **F.E.A.R. Extraction Point** (2006)
2. **F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate** (2007)

These expansions were standalone and introduced new storylines, levels, and gameplay elements to the F.E.A.R. universe.

If you'd like more details about either of these expansions, feel free to ask!
