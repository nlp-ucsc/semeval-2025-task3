In the context of retronymy, the appearance of a retronym is generally caused by technological advancements or cultural shifts that introduce new terms or concepts, making it necessary to distinguish the original term from its newer counterparts. This usually happens when the original term has become too broad or ambiguous due to changes in technology, society, or language usage. For example, the term "silent film" became necessary only after the introduction of "talkies," or sound films, in the late 1920s. Similarly, "acoustic guitar" emerged as a retronym after the development of electric guitars. Essentially, retronyms arise when there's a need to clarify or specify the original meaning of a term in the face of innovation or evolving contexts.
