Émile Reynaud, a French inventor and filmmaker, referred to his films as "Pantomimes Lumineuses." This translates to "Luminous Pantomimes" in English. Reynaud's work in the late 19th and early 20th centuries involved creating hand-drawn animated films that were projected using his invention, the Théâtre Optique. These animations were indeed luminous and told stories through pantomime, hence the name "Pantomimes Lumineuses."
