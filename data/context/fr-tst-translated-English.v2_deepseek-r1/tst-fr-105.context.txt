The term "collagisme" is not widely recognized in philosophical literature, and I am unaware of any prominent philosopher who specifically uses this term to describe artists who used collage from the 1910s onwards. It's possible that you may be referring to a less well-known philosopher or a specific academic work that employs this term. If you have more context or details, I might be able to provide a more accurate response.
