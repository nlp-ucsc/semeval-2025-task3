Abdel Rahman Aref became the temporary president of the Iraqi Republic following the February 1963 coup, known as Ramadan Revolution, in which his brother, President Abd as-Salam Aref, was assassinated. After the coup, Aref temporarily took over the presidency until he was succeeded by Abdul Karim Kassem, but this event might not align perfectly. I might need to verify historical details for accuracy.
