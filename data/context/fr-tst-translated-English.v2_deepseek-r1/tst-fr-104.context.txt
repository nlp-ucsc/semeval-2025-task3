The painter who is often credited with launching the Golden Age of Danish Painting is Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg (1783-1853). Eckersberg is considered one of the key figures in the Danish Golden Age, which took place during the first half of the 19th century. He was a professor at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and taught many prominent artists of the period, including Bertel Thorvaldsen, Constantin Hansen, and Wilhelm Marstrand. Eckersberg's work in both historical and genre painting, as well as his emphasis on naturalism and detail, helped lay the foundation for the artistic developments of the Golden Age in Denmark.
