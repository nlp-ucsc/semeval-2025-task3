The city of Rosario, located in the province of Santa Fe, Argentina, originated as a small settlement during the Spanish colonial period. The area was initially inhabited by the Tuyú, Toba, and Timbúes Native American groups. 

In 1794, the first chapel was built in what is now Rosario by Spanish colonists, marking the beginning of the city's development. Over time, the settlement grew due to its strategic location along the Paraná River, which facilitated trade and transportation. By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Rosario had become an important economic and cultural hub in Argentina, driven by immigration, particularly from Europe, and its role as a major agricultural export center.
