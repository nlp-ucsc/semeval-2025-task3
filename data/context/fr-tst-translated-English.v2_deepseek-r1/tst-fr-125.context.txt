Peter Iwers, the former bassist of the Swedish melodic death metal band In Flames, has mentioned several influences that shaped his playing style. Some key influences include:

1. **Steve Harris (Iron Maiden)**: Known for his galloping bass lines and prominent role in the band's music, Harris's influence can be heard in Iwers's melodic and driving bass work.

2. **Cliff Burton (Metallica)**: As a fan of Burton's work, Iwers admires his ability to create memorable and melodic bass lines that stand out within the heavy context of metal music.

3. **Jonas Björler (The Haunted)**: Being both a fellow musician and brother (since Anders Björler, Jonas's brother, was also in In Flames), Jonas's bass playing likely had a significant impact on Iwers's style.

4. **Tony Levin (King Crimson, Peter Gabriel)**: While Levin's work is in a different genre, Iwers has mentioned admiration for his technical prowess and unique approach to the bass.

Iwers's playing style combines a mix of melodic sensibility, technical proficiency, and rhythm, which are reflective of these influences.
