The Royal Palace of Gödöllő, located in Hungary, was built for Count Antal Grassalkovich I, a prominent Hungarian nobleman, in the mid-18th century. Construction began in 1733 and was completed around 1744. The palace was designed in the Baroque style by Viennese architect Andrea Mayerhoffer. It later became a royal palace when it was gifted to Emperor Francis Joseph I and Empress Elisabeth (Sisi) of Austria-Hungary in the 19th century. The palace served as one of their favorite residences.
