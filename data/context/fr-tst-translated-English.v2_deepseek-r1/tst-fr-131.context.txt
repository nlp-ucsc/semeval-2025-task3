Geoffroi de Villehardouin accompanies Theobald III, Count of Champagne, to the Fourth Crusade, not the Third Crusade. However, Theobald III dies before the crusade begins, and Villehardouin becomes one of the leaders of the expedition. During the Fourth Crusade, he is taken captive by the forces of the Byzantine Empire but is later released. His account of the crusade, "De la ConquÃªte de Constantinople," provides valuable insights into the events of the Fourth Crusade.
