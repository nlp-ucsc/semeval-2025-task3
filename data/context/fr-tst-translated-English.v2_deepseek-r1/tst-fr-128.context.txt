The name "Aukštojas" for the highest hill in Lithuania was proposed by professor K. Šeikis, during the Lithuanian National Revival in the early 20th century. This name emphasizes the hill's status as the highest point in the country, standing at 293.84 meters above sea level, and is located near the village of Juozapinė, in the Varėna district of the Alytus County. The hill is also known as Juozapinė Hill. The proposal of this name reflects the cultural and national significance attached to this geographical feature in Lithuania.
