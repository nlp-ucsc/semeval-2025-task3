The Leftovers is a thought-provoking American television series that delves into the aftermath of a global catastrophe known as the "Sudden Departure," where 2% of the world's population vanishes without explanation. The story primarily follows the Garvey family in the fictional town of Mapleton, New York, and later in Texas. The series explores themes of grief, trauma, faith, and the search for meaning in a world suddenly devoid of answers. Characters confront their own personal struggles, and some turn to mysterious groups like the Guilty Remnant, who practice silent, ritualistic behaviors to cope with the event. Over its three seasons, the show weaves a complex narrative that mixes grounded human drama with elements of the surreal and the unknown, leaving many questions unresolved and inviting viewers to reflect on existential and philosophical queries.
