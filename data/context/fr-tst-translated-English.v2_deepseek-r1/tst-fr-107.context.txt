The harmonic series is composed of fractions where each term is the reciprocal of a positive integer. Specifically, the nth term of the harmonic series is \( \frac{1}{n} \). 

For example, the series begins as:
\[ 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \ldots \]

Each term is a fraction \( \frac{1}{n} \), and the series continues indefinitely.
