In Greek mythology, the Aloadae (often spelled Aloadae or Aloiadae) were a pair of giants who were known for their incredible strength and their rebellion against the Olympian gods. They were the sons of Poseidon and Iphidemia, a mortal woman, and their names were Otus and Ephialtes. Here are some key points that differentiate the Aloadae from the more common giants of Greek mythology:

1. **Parentage**: Unlike the typical giants (Gigantes) who were the children of Gaea and Uranus, the Aloadae were the offspring of a god (Poseidon) and a mortal woman, making them demigods rather than pure giants.

2. **Size and Strength**: While all giants were large and strong, the Aloadae were said to be of enormous size, rivaling the gods themselves. They were known for their prodigious growth and strength, which made them formidable opponents even among other giants.

3. **Rebellion**: The Aloadae were notable for their specific act of rebellion against the Olympian gods. They attempted to overthrow Zeus by piling mountains (such as Mount Ossa on Mount Olympus and Mount Pelion on Ossa) to reach the heavens. This act of defiance was a direct challenge to the established order of the Olympian gods.

4. **Mythological Role**: The Gigantes were often depicted as a group of monsters and giants who rose up against the Olympian gods during the Gigantomachy, a great war between the gods and the giants. In contrast, the Aloadae were specific individuals with a distinct story and role in mythology, particularly their attempt to overthrow Zeus.

5. **Punishment**: The Aloadae were punished by the gods for their actions. Zeus, with the help of Apollo, defeated them, and they were either killed or imprisoned. This punishment was more personalized compared to the general defeat of the giants in the Gigantomachy.

In summary, while both the Aloadae and the general giants (Gigantes) were large, strong, and rebellious, the Aloadae were distinguished by their parentage, their specific acts of rebellion, and their unique punishment. They hold a distinct place in Greek mythology, highlighting the themes of hubris and divine retribution.
