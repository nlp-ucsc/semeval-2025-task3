Lil Dagover, whose real name was Marie Antonie Sieglinde Martha Seubert, was a renowned German actress during the silent film era. She discovered cinema relatively early in her career, which began in the 1910s. Dagover was part of the influential German film scene, particularly known for her roles in silent films. She started her acting career on the stage but transitioned to film as the medium gained popularity. Her breakthrough came around 1916-1917 when she started working with prominent directors like Fritz Lang, with whom she collaborated on films such as "Lilith und Ly" and "Die Spinnen." These early roles not only showcased her talent but also helped establish her as a leading figure in German cinema during the Weimar Republic era. Her discovery of cinema was thus a gradual process, moving from theater to the emerging world of motion pictures, where she found significant success and acclaim.
