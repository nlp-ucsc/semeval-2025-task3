Aristotle, a Greek philosopher, believed that happiness (eudaimonia) is achieved through living a virtuous life. He argued that happiness is not just a temporary feeling of pleasure, but rather a long-term state of well-being that results from consistently practicing virtues. 

One of the key ideas of Aristotle is that your actions should align with your rational faculties. According to him, humans have a unique potential for rational thought, and realizing this potential through virtuous actions leads to happiness. Therefore, happiness, according to Aristotle, is not dependent on a specific period of life but rather on how one lives their life as a whole. 

However, he also suggested that older age may provide a better opportunity for achieving happiness because, with age, individuals gain more wisdom, experience, and the ability to make better decisions. This wisdom and experience allow them to live more virtuously and achieve eudaimonia. 

In summary, happiness according to Aristotle is a lifelong pursuit of living a virtuous and rational life, and it can be more easily attained in older age due to accumulated wisdom and experience.
