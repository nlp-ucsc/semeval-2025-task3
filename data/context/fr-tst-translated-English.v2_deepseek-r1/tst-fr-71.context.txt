The plane involved in the Habsheim crash was a Ryanair UK Charter flight, but no, wait, that wasn't right. Let me double-check. Ah, yes, it was Air France Flight 296, which was an Airbus A320. It crashed during an air show at Habsheim, France on June 26, 1988. The flight was a demonstration flight intended to show the fly-by-wire system of the new Airbus A320. The crash occurred in a forest near the village of Habsheim. Miraculously, most people survived, but there were fatalities. I hope that answers your question.
