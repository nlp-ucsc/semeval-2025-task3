Yes, that's correct! Asteroid 661 Cloelia is indeed named after the Roman legendary figure Cloelia. In Roman mythology, Cloelia was a young woman known for her bravery and virtue. According to legend, she was one of a group of Roman women taken hostage by the Etruscan king Lars Porsena during a conflict in the 6th century BCE. Cloelia famously escaped by swimming across the Tiber River, returning to Rome as a hero and a symbol of Roman valor and determination.

The asteroid 661 Cloelia was discovered in 1908 by German astronomer Max Wolf. Astronomers often name celestial bodies after figures from mythology and history, and Cloelia's story of courage and strength made her a fitting namesake for this asteroid. It's a fascinating connection between ancient Roman lore and our modern study of the cosmos!
