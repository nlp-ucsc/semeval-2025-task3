Ultramarine blue, from a chemical perspective, is a complex inorganic compound primarily composed of a blue pigment. Its main constituents are sulfur, silicon, and aluminum, along with the presence of sodium. The chemical formula for ultramarine blue is not straightforward due to its complex structure, but it can be represented as Na₈Al₆Si₆O₂₄S₄. This pigment exists as a solid solution within a sodalite framework, which is a type of zeolite mineral. The deep blue coloration is attributable to the presence of a sulfur radical anion (S₃⁻) within the crystal lattice, resulting from the sulfur atoms' arrangement. Historically, ultramarine blue was derived from the semi-precious stone lapis lazuli, but today, it is primarily synthesized through high-temperature processes involving the heating of kaolin, silica, sodium carbonate, and sulfur-containing compounds.
