The origins of ironworking among Bantu-speaking peoples are traced back to the early iron age in Central Africa, around 300 BCE to 500 CE. Early Bantu-type iron artisans were likely part of migratory groups that spread iron technology and agriculture across Sub-Saharan Africa. They developed techniques like bloomery smelting, integral to their cultural and economic development, contributing significantly to the spread of metalworking in the region.
