Neolana is a genus of spiders in the family Stiphidiidae. These spiders are commonly known as "cruising spiders" or "huntsmen" due to their fast-moving nature. They are typically found in Australia and New Zealand, and are often encountered in leaf litter or under bark. The genus Neolana includes several species that are known for their active hunting style, unlike web-spinning spiders.
