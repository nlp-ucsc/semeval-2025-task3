In the year 186, Pertinax was sent as a legate to the province of Dacia, which is located in the region of modern-day Romania, not in France. At that time, Dacia was a part of the Roman Empire, and it was known for its rich resources, including gold mines. 

It's important to note that France as a country did not exist during the Roman Empire era. The region that is now France was then part of Gaul, divided into several Roman provinces such as Gallia Lugdunensis, Gallia Aquitania, and others. Therefore, Pertinax's legateship in 186 was in Dacia, outside of what is now France.
