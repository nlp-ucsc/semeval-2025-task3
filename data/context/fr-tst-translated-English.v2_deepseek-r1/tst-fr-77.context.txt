The construction of the German warship Emden was delayed due to a combination of structural issues during its building process. The Emden, a KÃ¶nigsberg-class light cruiser, was laid down in 1908 and launched in May 1909. However, during its fitting-out phase, several problems arose, including issues with its propulsion system and armor plating, which required additional time to resolve. These technical difficulties caused the delay in its completion and commissioning. The ship eventually entered service in July 1911.
