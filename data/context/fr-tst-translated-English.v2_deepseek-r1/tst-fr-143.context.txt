As of the most recent information available to me in July 2024, Condette is part of the agglomeration community of *Ville de Lens - Lievin*. This agglomeration community is located in the Hauts-de-France region of France.

For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend verifying with official local government or administrative sources. Agglomeration communities can change over time due to administrative reforms or regional adjustments. Ensuring you have the latest information from authoritative sources is always a good practice.
