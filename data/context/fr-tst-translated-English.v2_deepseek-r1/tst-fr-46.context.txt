The name "Garajonay" in Garajonay National Park comes from the Guanche language, which was spoken by the indigenous Berber people of the Canary Islands before the Spanish conquest. 

In Guanche, "Garajonay" can be interpreted to mean "place of wood" or "forest," which refers to the dense, lush forest that covers much of the park. The park, located on the island of La Gomera, is known for its extensive laurel forests, which are a unique feature of the Canary Islands' natural landscape. The name reflects the park's important ecological and cultural heritage.
