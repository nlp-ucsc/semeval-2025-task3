The Anglo-Irish, also known as the Old English in Ireland, are a group that descends primarily from the English settlers who arrived in Ireland during and after the Norman invasion of Ireland in the late 12th century. These settlers were part of the military expeditions led by Lord Richard de Clare, also known as Strongbow, who was invited to Ireland by the King of Leinster, Diarmait Mac Murchada, to help him regain his throne.

Over time, many of these English settlers intermarried with the native Irish population and adopted many Irish customs and languages. Despite their integration, they maintained a distinct identity and political allegiance separate from the native Irish. They primarily resided in the urban centers and the areas known as the Pale, around Dublin.

The term "Anglo-Irish" can also sometimes be used more broadly to include other groups of English and Welsh settlers who came to Ireland in later centuries, such as the Elizabethan and Cromwellian plantations. However, the core of the Anglo-Irish identity comes from the initial Norman settlers.

In summary, the Anglo-Irish descend from the English and Norman settlers who arrived in Ireland during the Norman invasion and subsequent periods, intermingling with the local population while maintaining distinct cultural and political identities.
