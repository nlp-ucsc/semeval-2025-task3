Le nubi cirrostrato rappresentano una tipologia di formazioni nuvolose che si manifestano solitamente a quote elevate, generalmente sopra i 2.000 metri. Queste nubi sono caratterizzate da uno strato uniforme e onnipresente nel cielo, spesso comparendo come una sorta di velo cheア卻シ何やらの能동objectmailto:gdpr@snapchat.com

Okay, the user is asking about the species in which cirrostratus clouds can occur. So, I need to explain the different forms or types within cirrostratus clouds.

Cirrostratus clouds are high-level clouds, so they form above 20,000 feet. They are uniform and can cover the whole sky like a thin veil. Since they're uniform, the main species would be related to their appearance.

First, the most common is Cirrostratus lakoso, which is the standard form, a uniform veil.

Then, there's Cirrostratus duplicatus, where there are multiple layers, giving a rippled or banded appearance.

Next, Cirrostratus castellanus, which has a wavy or rolled look, but this is less common in cirrostratus since it's more typical in altocumulus.

Also, sometimes Cirrostratus can create halos around the sun or moon, but that's more an optical effect than a species.

I should mention these different forms, explaining each briefly. Also, note that Cirrostratus is mostly the uniform type, but variations do occur with multiple layers or waves. I'll make sure to clarify that castellanus is rare in cirrostratus and more associated with other cloud types.
