کودتای ۲۸ مرداد در سال ۱۳۳۲ شمسی (/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, the user is asking about the 28 Mordad coup in Persian. I need to make sure I understand the date correctly. 28 Mordad corresponds to August 19th. The year is 1953 in the Gregorian calendar, which is 1332 in the Persian solar calendar. So the coup happened in 1953.

Now, the user wants to know the outcome of the coup. I remember that this was a significant event in Iranian history. It was a CIA-backed coup that overthrew the democratically elected government. The prime minister at the time was Mohammad Mossadegh. His government had nationalized the oil industry, which wasn't liked by Western powers, especially Britain and the US.

The coup led to the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, consolidating his power. Mossadegh was arrested and later tried. The Shah's rule became more authoritarian after this, and the coup marked the end of Iran's democratic movement for a while.

I should explain these points clearly: the year, the overthrow of Mossadegh, the role of foreign powers, the Shah's increased power, and the long-term effects on Iran's political landscape. Make sure to keep it concise and informative.
