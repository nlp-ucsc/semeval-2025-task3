I apologize, but there seems to be a misunderstanding in your query. The character you're referring to as "Tuomari" (which means "Judge" in Finnish) is not present in The Punisher series. The main character in The Punisher is Frank Castle, also known as The Punisher.

In the story arc "Kitchen Irish" from The Punisher series, Frank Castle is not trying to "clean" Hell's Kitchen in the sense of a judge or lawman. Instead, he becomes involved in a complex situation involving rival Irish gangs and criminal factions. 

The story begins when a bomb explodes in a Hell's Kitchen pub, drawing Frank Castle into a violent conflict between various Irish criminal groups[1]. These groups are fighting over a fortune left behind by a deceased Irish mob patriarch named Nesbitt[1]. 

Frank Castle, as The Punisher, engages with these criminal elements in his typical fashion - through violence and vigilantism. He's not acting as a judge or trying to "clean" the area in a legal sense, but rather eliminating criminals according to his own brutal code of justice.

The story involves multiple factions, including:

1. The Toners, an old Irish mob family
2. The River Rats, a group of river pirates
3. Maginty's gang
4. Finn Cooley and his IRA-connected group

Frank Castle works alongside two British characters, Yorkie and Andy Lorimer, who are investigating the bombing[1]. Throughout the story, Castle navigates the complex web of criminal alliances and rivalries, ultimately leading to violent confrontations and the elimination of many of these criminal elements.

It's important to note that The Punisher's methods are not those of a judge or legal authority, but of a vigilante who takes the law into his own hands, often through lethal means.
