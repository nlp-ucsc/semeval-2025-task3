Jef Raskin studied at multiple universities throughout his academic career:

1. State University of New York at Stony Brook: 
   Raskin received his undergraduate degrees from Stony Brook University[1][2]. Specifically, he earned:
   - A BA in Mathematics in 1964[7]
   - A BS in Physics[1]
   - Minors in Philosophy and Music[1][2]

2. Pennsylvania State University:
   Raskin earned a master's degree in Computer Science from Penn State in 1967[1][2]. He had initially enrolled in a PhD program in mathematical logic but switched to computer science due to differences with his advisor[1].

3. University of California, San Diego (UCSD):
   After completing his master's, Raskin enrolled in a graduate music program at UCSD[1][2]. However, he left the program before completing it to become a professor in the Visual Arts department at the same university[1][2].

While Raskin pursued graduate studies at multiple institutions, he never completed a PhD. He came close twice - once at Penn State where the university didn't receive expected accreditation for a PhD in computer science, and again at UCSD where administrative issues prevented him from completing a PhD while teaching in a different department[2].
