HMY Britannia served as the royal yacht for 44 years, from 1954 to 1997[1][4][7]. 

Specifically:

- It was launched on April 16, 1953[1][4]
- It was commissioned and entered service on January 11, 1954[1][4][8]
- It was decommissioned on December 11, 1997[1][8]

During its 44 years of royal service, HMY Britannia:

- Traveled over 1 million nautical miles[1][4][7]
- Visited over 600 ports in 135 countries[1][4][5]
- Carried out 968 official royal voyages[6]
- Served as a royal residence, diplomatic venue, and honeymoon destination for several royal couples[1][4]

The yacht played an important role in British diplomacy and served as a floating royal residence for Queen Elizabeth II and the royal family. Its long service came to an end in 1997 when the newly elected Labour government decided not to replace it due to the high costs involved[7][8].
