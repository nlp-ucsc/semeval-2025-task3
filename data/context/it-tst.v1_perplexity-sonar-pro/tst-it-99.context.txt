I apologize, but I do not have any specific information about the occupations of director Andrej Kravčuk's parents in the given search results. The search results do not contain any details about Andrej Kravčuk or his family background. The provided information is primarily about the history of abandoned children (besprizorniki) in post-revolutionary Russia and the Soviet Union, as well as a personal account of a Ukrainian man's experiences during the fall of the USSR. Without access to reliable sources about Andrej Kravčuk's family history, I cannot provide accurate information about his parents' professions.
