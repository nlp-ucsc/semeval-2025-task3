The initial formation of the band Health consisted of four members:

1. Jake Duzsik - vocals and guitar
2. John Famiglietti - bass and electronics
3. B.J. Miller - drums
4. Jupiter Keyes - guitar and synthesizer[1][2]

The band was founded in 2005 in Los Angeles, California. Jake Duzsik and John Famiglietti met while working at Guitar Center in Los Angeles and decided to form a band. They then recruited Jupiter Keyes, whom Duzsik knew from university, and drummer B.J. Miller[1].

This original four-member lineup remained intact until 2015 when Jupiter Keyes left the band[1]. Since then, Health has continued as a trio consisting of Duzsik, Famiglietti, and Miller[2].

The band members chose the name "Health" after agreeing it should be an "everyday word." When reviewing a list of potential names, "health" was the only one that wasn't already taken by another band[1].
