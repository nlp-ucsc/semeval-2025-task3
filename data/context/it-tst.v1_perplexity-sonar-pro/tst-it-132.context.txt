Based on the search results provided, I don't have specific information about an Italian artist who introduced the term "Carte Costruite" referring to collages made with papers previously prepared with tempera or acrylic paint. The search results don't contain any direct mention of this term or technique.

However, I can provide some related information about Italian artists who worked with paper and collage techniques:

Mimmo Rotella (1918-2006) was an Italian artist known for his innovative use of torn posters in his artworks. While he didn't use the term "Carte Costruite," his technique of using torn posters and recomposing them on canvas was a form of collage that involved manipulating existing paper materials[5].

Alighiero Boetti (1940-1994) was another Italian artist who worked with paper in unconventional ways. He created sculptures using paper doilies and cardboard rolls, showing an interest in everyday paper materials as artistic media[7].

It's worth noting that many Italian artists in the 20th century experimented with various materials and techniques, including paper manipulation and collage. However, without more specific information, I cannot attribute the term "Carte Costruite" to a particular artist based on the provided search results.

If you have additional information or sources about this specific term or technique, it would be helpful in identifying the artist you're asking about.
