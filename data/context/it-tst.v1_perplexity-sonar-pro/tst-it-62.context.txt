- The body has a shimmering, semi-transparent bluish-silver hue[2].
- It sometimes displays a radiant golden-yellow sheen[2].
- The body color is described as a semi-transparent silvery-blue, occasionally with "sprinkles" of golden-yellow[4].
- Males tend to have an overall yellow-green color[6].

Additionally, the fish has some distinctive markings and fin coloration:

- It has bright yellow, orange, or orangey-red tips on its pectoral fins[2].
- The anal, dorsal, and tail fins have white borders with oblong or rounded dark spots scattered over them[2].
- There is a fascinating latticework pattern over the body, with several rows of black-bordered scales[2].
