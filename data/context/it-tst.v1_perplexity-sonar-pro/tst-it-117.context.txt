Aukštojas Hill is located in the Medininkai Highlands, approximately 24 kilometers (15 miles) southeast of Vilnius, the capital city of Lithuania[1][2]. While the search results do not explicitly state the specific commune, they provide some key details about its location:

1. It is situated in the Migūnai forestry area[1][2].
2. The hill is part of the Medininkai Highlands[1][2].
3. It is located about 500 meters (1,600 feet) from Juozapinė Hill, which was previously considered the highest point in Lithuania[1][2].

Based on this information, it's likely that Aukštojas Hill is located within the administrative boundaries of the Vilnius Region Municipality. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the Vilnius Region Municipality Council officially approved the name "Aukštojas" for the hill on November 18, 2005[1].

It's worth noting that Aukštojas Hill is the highest point in Lithuania, with an elevation of 293.84 meters (964.0 feet) above sea level[1][2]. This measurement was confirmed in 2004 using GPS technology by specialists from the Institute of Geodesy at Vilnius Gediminas Technical University[1][2].

The hill's name, "Aukštojas," was suggested by Libertas Klimka, a professor of history at Vilnius Pedagogical University, and was chosen through a contest to name the newly discovered highest elevation[1]. Aukštėjas (also known as Aukštojas or Aukštujis) was an important deity in ancient Lithuanian mythology, considered to be the creator of the world[1].
