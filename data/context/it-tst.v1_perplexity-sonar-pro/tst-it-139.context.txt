Mario Bolatti scored 1 goal for the Argentina national team[1][4]. This crucial goal came on October 14, 2009 in Montevideo, Uruguay during a 2010 World Cup qualification match against Uruguay[1][2][5]. Bolatti came on as a substitute and scored in the 84th minute, securing Argentina's qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa[1].

This goal was particularly significant as it was Bolatti's only international goal in his 12 appearances for Argentina[4]. Despite having a relatively short international career, this single goal had a major impact, ensuring Argentina's place in the World Cup tournament.

Bolatti was subsequently included in Argentina's final 23-man squad for the 2010 World Cup by manager Diego Maradona[1]. While he didn't score any additional goals for the national team, his contribution in that crucial qualifying match remains a highlight of his international career.
