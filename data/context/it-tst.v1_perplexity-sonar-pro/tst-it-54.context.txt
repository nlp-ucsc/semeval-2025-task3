Based on the search results provided, I do not have enough reliable information to determine the name of Abd al-Rahman Arif's wife. The search results do not contain any specific mention of Abd al-Rahman Arif's spouse. While some of the sources provide biographical information about Arif, including his role as president of Iraq from 1966 to 1968, they do not include details about his wife or family. Without more definitive sources, I cannot confidently state the name of Abd al-Rahman Arif's wife.
