Gordon Strachan, the former Scottish football player and manager, has two sons:

1. Craig Strachan[1]
2. Gavin Strachan[1][2]

Both of Gordon Strachan's sons followed in their father's footsteps and became involved in football:

- Gavin Strachan is the more prominent of the two in the football world. He was born on December 23, 1978, and had a career as a professional footballer before moving into coaching[2]. Gavin is currently a first-team coach at Celtic FC, one of Scotland's most successful clubs[5]. He has also worked as an assistant manager at Doncaster Rovers and Peterborough United[5].

- Craig Strachan also had a career in football, though less is known about his specific roles or achievements compared to his brother Gavin[1].

It's worth noting that Gordon Strachan's family involvement in football extends to another generation as well. Gavin Strachan's son (and Gordon's grandson), Luke Strachan, has also become a footballer[1], continuing the family's legacy in the sport.
