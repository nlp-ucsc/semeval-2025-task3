The family Oxycarenidae, commonly known as oxyCarennid bugs, includes approximately 30 to 40 genera. These are small, often brightly colored insects that are usually found on plants. The exact number of genera can vary depending on taxonomic sources and recent classifications, as entomology is a field that is continually being updated with new research and discoveries. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, it would be best to consult a recent scientific publication or a reliable entomological database.
