A **kaimyō** (戒名) is a Buddhist name given to an individual upon their ordination as a Buddhist monk or nun, or when they undergo a specific Buddhist ritual. It is a tradition primarily observed in East Asian Buddhism, including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese traditions. 

### Key Points about Kaimyō:
1. **Meaning**: 
   - The term "kai" (戒) means "precept" or "commandment," and "myō" (名) means "name." Thus, a kaimyō represents the name taken by someone who has committed to following the Buddhist precepts.

2. **Significance**:
   - The kaimyō reflects the person's new identity as a Buddhist practitioner. It symbolizes their renunciation of the worldly life and their commitment to the Buddhist path.

3. **When It's Given**:
   - It is typically awarded during specific Buddhist ceremonies, such as ordination (when someone becomes a monk or nun) or during a Jukai ceremony (where laypeople receive the precepts).
   - Lay Buddhists can also receive a kaimyō, particularly during the Jukai ceremony, as a way to deepen their commitment to the Buddhist teachings.

4. **Structure**:
   - Kaimyō often consists of two or three Chinese characters (Kanji in Japanese). The first character is often "kai" (戒) or another character related to the precepts. The second character varies based on the individual or the lineage. Sometimes, a third character is added to further specify the name.
   - For example, "Kaito" or "Kaien."

5. **Usage**:
   - The kaimyō is used in Buddhist rituals, ceremonies, and within the sangha (Buddhist community). Monks and nuns often use their kaimyō publicly, while lay practitioners may use it during ceremonies or within Buddhist communities.

6. **Cultural Variations**:
   - In Japan, the kaimyō is also used in funerals. When someone passes away, they are given a posthumous kaimyō called "kaimyō" or "hōmyō." This name is often inscribed on their gravestone and is used in memorial services to honor the deceased.

7. **Posthumous Use**:
   - In some traditions, a kaimyō is awarded posthumously. This is not a casual practice but is part of specific rituals meant to honor the deceased and assist their transition in the afterlife.

8. **Examples**:
   - Famous persons like Dogen Zenji, the founder of Soto Zen, had a kaimyō "Dogen" (道元), which means "Way Origin."
   - Hōnen, the founder of Pure Land Buddhism in Japan, had the kaimyō "Hōnen" (法然), meaning "Dharma FreeBSD."

### Conclusion:
The kaimyō is a meaningful part of Buddhist practice, symbolizing dedication to the teachings and the scriptures. It serves as a reminder of the individual's commitment to the Buddhist way of life and their new spiritual identity.
