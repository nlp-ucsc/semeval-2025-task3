The Battle of Long Island, also known as the Battle of Brooklyn, took place on August 27, 1776, during the American Revolutionary War. The British forces, under the command of General William Howe and his brother Admiral Richard Howe, decisively defeated the Continental Army led by General George Washington. This battle was one of the largest of the war and marked a significant British victory, leading to the occupation of New York City by the British for the remainder of the war.
