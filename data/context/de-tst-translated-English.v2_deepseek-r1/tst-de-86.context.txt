Beauvechain is a municipality in the Walloon region of Belgium, specifically located in the province of Walloon Brabant. As of my last update in July 2024, Beauvechain is composed of the following districts or villages:

1. Beauvechain
2. Hamme-Mille
3. Nethen
4. Tourinnes-Saint-Lambert

These districts together form the municipality of Beauvechain. If there have been any administrative changes since then, it would be best to consult a more recent source for the most accurate information.
