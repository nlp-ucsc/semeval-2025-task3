During British colonial rule, Zimbabwe was known as Southern Rhodesia. It was named after the Rhodesia region, which was itself named in honor of Cecil Rhodes, a prominent British colonial figure. Southern Rhodesia was a British colony from 1898 until it declared unilateral independence in 1965, leading to a period of international sanctions and conflict. In 1980, it gained independence from the United Kingdom and was renamed Zimbabwe.
