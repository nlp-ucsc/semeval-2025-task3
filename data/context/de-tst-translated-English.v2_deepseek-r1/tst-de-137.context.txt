Guillemots are seabirds and primarily feed on fish, crustaceans, and marine worms. They hunt while swimming underwater, using their wings to propel themselves as they pursue their prey. Their diet can vary depending on the season and location, but they mainly consume small fish like sandeels, herring, and capelin, as well as crustaceans such as crabs and shrimp. Guillemots are efficient divers and can dive to considerable depths in search of food, making them well-adapted to their marine environment.
