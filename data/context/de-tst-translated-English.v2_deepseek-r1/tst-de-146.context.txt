The currency of the Ukrainian People's Republic, established in 1917, was the **hryvnia** (гарбуз, pl. **hryvni**). This was the same currency that Ukraine adopted again after gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.

The hryvnia was introduced in 1918, replacing the Russian ruble. However, due to the political instability and economic challenges faced by the Ukrainian People's Republic, the hryvnia did not gain much stability and eventually fell out of use.

I hope this helps clarify things! Let me know if you have any more questions.
