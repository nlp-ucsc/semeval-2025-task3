Yes, that's correct! The term "arcade" does indeed have its roots in the Latin word "arcus," meaning "arch." Over time, the term evolved to describe a structure composed of a series of arches supported by columns or piers. Arcades are commonly found in architectural designs, such as in classical buildings, shopping centers, and walkways, where they provide both functional and aesthetic purposes.
