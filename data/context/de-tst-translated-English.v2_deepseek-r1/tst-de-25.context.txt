The Second Council of Nicaea was convened in the year 787 AD. It was the seventh ecumenical council of Christianity and is primarily known for reinstating the veneration of icons, which ended the period of iconoclasm (the destruction of religious images) in the Byzantine Empire. This council was held under the auspices of Emperor Constantine VI and his mother, Empress Irene.
