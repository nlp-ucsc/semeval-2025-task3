I'm not certain about the specific period when Ożarów was deprived of its town rights. Historical records about smaller towns can sometimes be less clear, and I don't have access to detailed information on this specific event. It might be helpful to consult local historical documents or scholarly works that focus on the history of Ożarów or the region it's in for a more accurate answer.
