The evaporated text indicates a request for information about the construction date of a church in Rosendorf, Thuringia. The user's provided text seems incomplete, mentioning only the location. To provide an accurate answer, I need to research or recall information about churches in Rosendorf, Thuringia. Unfortunately, without specific details, I can't retrieve the exact construction date. It's possible that the church was built in the Middle Ages, as many churches in Thuringia were, but without more information, I can't confirm this. I should inform the user that the exact date isn't available in the current data and suggest consulting local historical records or sources for more precise information.
