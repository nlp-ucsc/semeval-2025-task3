As of my last update in July 2024, the actor who has been nominated the most for the Best Supporting Actor award at the British Academy Film Awards (BAFTAs) is Denholm Elliott. He was nominated four times. However, please note that this information might have changed since then. For the most accurate and recent data, I recommend checking the latest BAFTA records or official announcements.
