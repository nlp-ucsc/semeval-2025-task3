As of my last update in July 2024, I don't have access to real-time data or specific statistics for December 2022. For the most accurate and up-to-date information on the population of Terrazzo, I recommend checking the latest reports from the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) or the official website of the municipality. These sources should provide the most current population figures.
