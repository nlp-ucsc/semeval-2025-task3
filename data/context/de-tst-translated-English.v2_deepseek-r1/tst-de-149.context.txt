Bombykol is a type of pheromone, specifically a sexual pheromone released by female silkworm moths (Bombyx mori). It is used to attract male moths for mating. When a female silkworm moth is ready to mate, she releases bombykol into the air. Male moths have specialized receptors on their antennae that detect this pheromone, allowing them to locate the female and mate with her. This chemical communication is crucial for the reproductive success of the species, ensuring that males can find females over long distances.
