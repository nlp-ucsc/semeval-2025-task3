Papier collé is a French term meaning "pasted paper" or "glued paper." It refers to a technique in art that involves creating images or designs by gluing pieces of paper onto a surface. This method was widely used by artists, particularly in the early 20th century, as part of the Cubist movement. Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque were pioneers in employing papier collé, integrating fragments of printed or colored paper into their compositions to add texture and depth.

In addition to its use in fine art, papier collé is also a popular craft activity. It allows individuals to experiment with different materials and techniques, making it accessible to both children and adults. The simplicity of the process—cutting, arranging, and gluing paper—makes it a versatile medium for expressing creativity.

Historically, papier collé has been significant in the development of modern art, as it challenged traditional practices and expanded the boundaries of artistic expression. Today, it continues to be a dynamic and evolving art form, with artists pushing the limits of what can be achieved with paper and adhesive.
