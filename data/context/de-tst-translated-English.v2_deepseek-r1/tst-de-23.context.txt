As of the most recent estimates available to me in July 2024, FÃ¼zesabony, a district in Heves County, Hungary, has a population of approximately 12,072 residents. Please note that population figures can change due to various factors such as migration and natural population growth or decline. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking the latest data from official sources such as the Hungarian Central Statistical Office (KSH).
