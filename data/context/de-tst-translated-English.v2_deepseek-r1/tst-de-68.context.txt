The Protestant church in Ter√©ny, Hungary was built in the late 18th century. Specifically, it was constructed around 1790. The church serves the local Protestant community and is a notable example of the architectural style prevalent during that period in Hungary. If you need more detailed historical information, I recommend consulting local historical records or studies on the religious architecture of the region.
