The first Baptist congregation in Norway was founded by **Hans Nielsen Hauge**. Hauge, a Norwegian lay preacher, played a significant role in the religious and cultural awakening in Norway in the early 19th century. He was not a Baptist but influenced the growth of Baptist and other dissenting movements. 

The first Baptist congregation in Norway was formally established in 1857 by **Lars Olsen Skrefsrud**, who is often referred to as the "father of the Baptist movement in Norway." Skrefsrud was deeply inspired by the Baptist principles, and he organized the first Baptist congregation in Stavanger. His work laid the foundation for the spread of Baptist teaching in the country.

The Baptist movement gained momentum in Norway in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as Baptists began to organize themselves more formally. However, it is important to note that the Baptist denominations also faced religious restrictions until religious freedom was granted in Norway in 1820.

Therefore, while Hauge's influence laid the groundwork for the movement, the formal establishment of the first Baptist congregation is attributed to Lars Olsen Skrefsrud.
