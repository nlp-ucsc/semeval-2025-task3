A retronym is a term that is created to distinguish the original version of something from later versions, especially when new technology or developments make the original seem outdated or less advanced. Retronyms often arise when a new product, concept, or innovation enters the market, forcing people to retroactively create new terminology to differentiate the older version from the newer one.

### Examples:
1. **Acoustic Guitar**:
   - Before the invention of the electric guitar, guitars were simply called "guitars." After the electric guitar became popular, the original version needed a distinguishing name, hence "acoustic guitar."

2. **Landline**:
   - Originally, phones were connected to physical lines, so they were just called "phones." With the advent of mobile phones, the term "landline" was coined to refer to the older, wired telephones.

3. **Snail Mail**:
   - Traditional postal mail was the only form of mail until email became widespread. The term "snail mail" emerged as a retronym to contrast it with the faster, electronic version.

4. **Film Camera**:
   - Before digital cameras, cameras were simply referred to as "cameras." With the rise of digital technology, "film camera" became the retronym for the older type.

### Purpose:
Retronyms serve to clarify and avoid confusion in language as new developments render older terms insufficient or ambiguous. They highlight the evolution of technology, culture, and society by creating linguistic distinctions where none were previously needed.
