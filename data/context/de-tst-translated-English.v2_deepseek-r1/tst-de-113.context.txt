The small bamboo rat, also known as *Rhizomys przewalskii*, is a species of rodent in the family Spalacidae. These rats are characterized by their stocky bodies and short, stubby tails, which are a notable feature of bamboo rats.

The tail of the small bamboo rat is relatively short, typically reaching only about 2-5 centimeters (0.8-2 inches) in length. This is much shorter compared to many other rodents, where tails can be quite long. The short tail of the small bamboo rat is an adaptation to its lifestyle, as it spends most of its time underground, burrowing through bamboo roots and other vegetation. Having a short tail may help reduce drag as it moves through tight underground spaces.

It's worth noting that the exact length of the tail can vary slightly depending on the subspecies and the age of the individual rat, but generally, it stays within the 2-5 cm range. The tail is also hairless and appears quite rudimentary, as it is not used for climbing or balance, unlike in many other rodents where the tail plays a more significant role in locomotion.

Overall, the small bamboo rat's tail is a distinguishing feature that reflects its specialized ecological niche, emphasizing its adaptation to a subterranean and secretive lifestyle.
