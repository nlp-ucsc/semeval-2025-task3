In Europe, the genus *Fomitiporia* includes several species of fungi that are commonly found on various types of decayed wood. Some of the notable species within this genus that occur in Europe include:

1. **Fomitiporia punctata**: This species is widely distributed across Europe and is often found growing on the wood of deciduous trees, particularly on beech (*Fagus* spp.) and birch (*Betula* spp.).

2. **Fomitiporia robusta**: As the name suggests, this is a robust species that typically grows on the wood of coniferous trees, such as pine (*Pinus* spp.) and spruce (*Picea* spp.).

3. **Fomitiporia cylindrica**: This species is characterized by its cylindrical or columnar fruiting bodies and is often found on the wood of deciduous trees like oak (*Quercus* spp.) and maple (*Acer* spp.).

4. **Fomitiporia tabacinus**: This species is known for its distinctive tabacum-like odor when fresh and is commonly found on the wood of coniferous trees, particularly pine (*Pinus* spp.).

These species play an important ecological role in breaking down dead wood and recycling nutrients within ecosystems. They are also of interest to mycologists and naturalists due to their diverse growth forms and habitats.
