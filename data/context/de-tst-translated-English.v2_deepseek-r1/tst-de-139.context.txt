The Jomsvikings were a group of Viking warriors and mercenaries who were based in a fortified settlement known as Jomsborg. The exact location of Jomsborg has been a topic of debate among historians and archaeologists, but the most widely accepted theory is that it was situated on the island of Wolin, which is located off the coast of present-day Poland in the Baltic Sea.

Wolin is an island in the Baltic Sea, near the mouth of the Oder River, and it is part of modern-day Poland. The strategic location of Wolin made it an important center for trade and warfare in the Viking Age. The Jomsvikings were known for their military prowess and their adherence to strict codes of conduct, which set them apart from other Viking groups. They were also associated with the legendary figure of Earl Sigvald, who was said to be the leader of the Jomsvikings.

Archaeological excavations on Wolin have uncovered evidence of a large Viking-age settlement, including fortifications, that align with the descriptions of Jomsborg in the Icelandic Sagas. These findings further support the theory that Wolin was indeed the location of the Jomsvikings' stronghold.

In summary, the Jomsvikings were primarily located on the island of Wolin in the Baltic Sea, which is part of contemporary Poland.
