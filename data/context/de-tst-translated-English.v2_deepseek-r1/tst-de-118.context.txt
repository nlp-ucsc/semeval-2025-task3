The orbit is formed by several bones that create the bony structure around the eye. The main bones involved are:

1. **Frontal Bone**: Forms the upper part of the orbit.
2. **Maxilla Bone**: Forms the lower part of the orbit, including the orbital floor.
3. **Lacrimal Bone**: Contains the lacrimal groove, which is part of the tear duct system.
4. **Palatine Bone**: Contributes to the floor and medial wall of the orbit.
5. **Sphenoid Bone**: Forms part of the lateral wall of the orbit.
6. **Zygomatic Bone**: Forms the lateral and lower parts of the orbital rim.
7. **Ethmoid Bone**: Contributes to the medial wall of the orbit.

Together, these bones create the orbital cavity that protects and supports the eyeball and associated structures.
