In 1932, France produced a significant number of films. While I can't provide an exact number, it's known that during the early 1930s, the French film industry was quite active, transitioning from silent films to talkies. This period saw the emergence of influential directors like Jean Renoir and Julien Duvivier, who contributed to notable works such as Renoir's "Boudu Saved from Drowning" (1932). The French cinema of that era was both prolific and innovative, laying the groundwork for the celebrated French New Wave of the late 1950s and 1960s. For precise statistics, consulting a detailed filmography or historical cinema database would be necessary.
