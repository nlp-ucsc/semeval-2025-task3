The winner of the 2013 Iranian presidential election was Hassan Rouhani. He won a decisive victory in the first round on June 14, 2013, securing just over 50% of the vote, which meant there was no need for a runoff election. This election marked a significant shift towards more moderate policies within the Iranian political landscape.
