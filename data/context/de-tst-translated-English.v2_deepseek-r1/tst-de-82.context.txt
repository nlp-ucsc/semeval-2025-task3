The Bolivarian Revolutionary Movement (Movimiento Bolivariano Revolucionario, MBR-200) was a political and military organization in Venezuela, founded by Hugo Chávez in the 1980s. The MBR-200 attempted a coup d'état in February 1992, known as the February coup attempt or the "4F coup." This was one of two coup attempts led by Hugo Chávez that year; the other occurred in November 1992. The February coup was unsuccessful, and Hugo Chávez was arrested. However, the coup attempt gained him significant public attention and laid the groundwork for his eventual rise to the presidency through democratic elections in 1998.
