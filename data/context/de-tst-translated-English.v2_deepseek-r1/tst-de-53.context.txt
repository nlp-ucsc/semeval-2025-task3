The global mountain-building phase during which the Alps were formed is known as the **Alpine orogeny**. This phase occurred during the Cenozoic Era, primarily between 65 and 2.6 million years ago, and was part of a larger tectonic event affecting mountain ranges worldwide. The Alpine orogeny was driven by the collision between the African and Eurasian tectonic plates, leading to the formation of the Alps and other mountain ranges like the Atlas Mountains and the Himalayas.
