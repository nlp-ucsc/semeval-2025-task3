The incident involving the beaked whales washing up on Opape Beach in December 2010 is a matter of public record and has been studied by marine biologists and conservationists. These whales were from the species known as Bahamonde's beaked whales (Mesoplodon bahamondi). 

In terms of size, Bahamonde's beaked whales typically grow to approximately 4.5 meters (about 14.76 feet) in length. However, the specific whales that stranded in 2010 were a group of six individuals, which is a notable number for this species. 

The stranding of these whales was a rare opportunity for scientists to study this elusive species up close, as beaked whales are not commonly seen or studied alive. The event provided valuable insights into their biology, behavior, and the potential threats they face, such as noise pollution from human activities that can disrupt their communication and navigation.

It's important to note that strandings of marine mammals, while tragic, contribute significantly to scientific research and the conservation efforts aimed at protecting these animals and their habitats.
