The name "Alvignac" likely originates from the Occitan language, which is spoken in southern France. In Occitan, the suffix "-ignac" is a diminutive form, often used to denote a small place or a younger son. The prefix "Alv" could be derived from a personal name, perhaps "Alvus" or "Alvin," which might have been the name of a local lord or landowner during the Middle Ages.

So, "Alvignac" might mean something like "the small place of Alv" or "the estate of Alv." Over time, the name evolved into its current form through linguistic changes and adaptations typical of the region's history.

It's worth noting that place names in France, especially in regions with strong Occitan roots, often have origins tied to local geography, personal names, or historical events. If you're interested in a more detailed etymology, consulting local historical records or linguistic studies specific to the Occitan language could provide additional insights.
