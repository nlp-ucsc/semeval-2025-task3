The Dutch engineer who began the draining of the English Fens in the 17th century was **Cornelius Vermuyden**. Vermuyden was invited to England by King Charles I to oversee the drainage project, which aimed to convert the marshy, often flooded areas of the Fens into arable land. His work, though controversial and sometimes unsuccessful in the short term, laid the foundation for later drainage efforts in the region.
