The second voyage of the light cruiser "Emden" in the years 1928 and 1929 was a training cruise that took the ship to several international ports. "Emden," which was a German KÃ¶nigsberg-class light cruiser, was commissioned in 1925 as part of the Reichsmarine, the navy of the Weimar Republic. This voyage was part of Germany's efforts to re-establish its naval presence and international relations after World War I.

During this voyage, "Emden" traveled extensively through the Atlantic Ocean, visiting ports in South America, Africa, and possibly other regions. The specific destinations included stops in South American countries such as Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay, as well as visits to ports in West Africa. These journeys were not only for training purposes but also served to demonstrate Germany's return to the international stage and to strengthen diplomatic ties with other nations.

The voyage of "Emden" during 1928 and 1929 was significant as it marked one of the first major overseas deployments of the German navy after the Treaty of Versailles, showcasing the country's gradual reintegration into global affairs.
