As of my knowledge cutoff in July 2024, Cape Verde has not sent any athletes to the Winter Olympic Games. Cape Verde, being a tropical island nation, has typically participated in Summer Olympics, with its athletes competing in sports such as track and field, boxing, and other summer disciplines. However, the country has not yet made its debut in the Winter Olympics. It's always possible that in the future, Cape Verde might send athletes to compete in winter sports if they qualify.
