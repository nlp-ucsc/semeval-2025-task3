El Al Flight 402, a passenger aircraft operated by the Israeli national airline El Al, was shot down on July 27, 1955, while flying from Vienna, Austria, to Tel Aviv, Israel. The flight was en route and passed through Bulgarian airspace without authorization, which led to it being mistaken for a military aircraft by Bulgarian air defenses. As a result, Bulgarian fighter jets intercepted and shot down the plane, resulting in the loss of all 58 lives on board.

An investigation later revealed that the tragedy occurred due to a combination of factors, including navigational errors and a lack of proper communication between the flight crew and air traffic control. The incident underscored the importance of accurate navigation and clear communication in aviation to prevent such tragedies.
