The Nimravidae, commonly referred to as "false sabertooths," were a family of predatory mammals that lived during the Cenozoic Era. They existed from the Eocene epoch, around 50 million years ago, up to the Miocene epoch, approximately 20 million years ago. Although they are not directly related to the true sabertoothed cats (Smilodontinae), they shared similar physical characteristics, such as elongated canine teeth. The Nimravidae were primarily found in North America, Europe, and Asia.
