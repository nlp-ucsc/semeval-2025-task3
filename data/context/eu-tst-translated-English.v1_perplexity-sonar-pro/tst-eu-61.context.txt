I apologize, but I don't have accurate information about which municipalities border Milton. The search results provided don't contain specific details about Milton's neighboring municipalities. Additionally, there seems to be some confusion as the query mentions "Miletok" which is not a place name I recognize.

To properly answer this question, we would need more specific information about which Milton is being referred to, as there are multiple towns and cities named Milton in different countries and states. For example, the search results mention Milton in Washington state, Milton in Ontario, Canada, and Milton in Georgia, USA. Each of these locations would have different bordering municipalities.

If you could provide more context about which specific Milton you're asking about, I'd be happy to research further and provide a more accurate answer about its bordering municipalities.
