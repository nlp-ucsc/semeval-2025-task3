John Waters began his filmmaking career in the mid-1960s with experimental, low-budget, and transgressive short films and features that pushed the boundaries of conventional cinema[1][7].

His earliest works include:

1. "Hag in a Black Leather Jacket" (1965): Waters' first film, shot on 8mm black and white reversal film with a separate soundtrack on 1/4" tape. It was an experimental short film that required manual synchronization of picture and sound during projection[10].

2. "Roman Candles" and "Eat Your Makeup": These were short films Waters made after returning to Baltimore from New York University[1].

3. "Mondo Trasho" (1969): Waters' first feature-length film. It was an experimental work with little plot, showcasing his emerging style as a subversive filmmaker. The film introduced Divine, Waters' longtime collaborator, in two roles[3][9].

4. "Multiple Maniacs" (1970): Waters' second feature and first "talkie." Shot on a minimal budget, it followed the character of Lady Divine and her "Cavalcade of Perversions," pushing the boundaries of taste and censorship[3].

These early films were characterized by:

- Low budgets and DIY production methods[7]
- Use of Waters' friends as actors, particularly Divine and other members of the "Dreamlanders" troupe[1]
- Transgressive themes and shocking content[1][4]
- Experimental techniques and non-traditional narratives[3]
- A focus on marginalized characters and subversive humor[9]

Waters' early works laid the foundation for his later cult classics and established his reputation as a provocative and boundary-pushing filmmaker[1][4].
