Amyema shrubs, which are parasitic plants commonly known as mistletoes, are found primarily in the following regions:

1. Australia: Amyema species are widespread throughout mainland Australia, particularly in arid inland areas[2][3]. For example:

   - Amyema quandang (grey mistletoe) is found across the Australian mainland, especially in arid inland regions[2].
   - Amyema miquelii is widespread in open forests in all mainland Australian states[3].

2. Southeast Asia: The genus extends from the southeast Asian mainland to islands in the southwestern Pacific[1]. Specifically:

   - Malaya (now part of Malaysia) and Thailand have limited representation, with only a single species occurring in these areas[1].
   - The genus becomes more diverse eastwards from Sumatra and Borneo to the Philippines[1].

3. Malesian region: This area, which includes Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, hosts numerous Amyema species[1].

4. New Guinea: This island is a major center of Amyema diversity, with 27 species endemic to the New Guinean mainland[1].

5. Southwest Pacific islands: Some Amyema species extend into Pacific islands, with one species reaching as far as the Caroline Islands and Samoa[1].

Amyema shrubs are found in a wide range of habitats, from closed humid forests to arid woodlands[1]. They parasitize various host plants, commonly attaching to species of Acacia and Eucalyptus in Australia[2][3]. The genus shows increasing species richness from west to east, with the highest diversity found in New Guinea and Australia[1].

It's worth noting that Amyema is the largest genus in its group within the Loranthaceae family, comprising approximately 92 species in total[1]. Their distribution pattern reflects both their evolutionary history linked to the breakup of Gondwanaland and more recent dispersal events in the late Tertiary period[1].
