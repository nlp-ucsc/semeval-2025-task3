The density of sodium sulfate varies depending on its form:

For anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4):
- The density is approximately 2.664-2.70 g/cm3 at room temperature[1][2][3][5].

For sodium sulfate decahydrate (Na2SO4·10H2O):
- The density is approximately 1.464 g/cm3[1][2].

Some key points about sodium sulfate's density:

1. The anhydrous form has a significantly higher density than the hydrated form due to the absence of water molecules in its crystal structure.

2. The density of anhydrous sodium sulfate is reported as 2.664 g/cm3 by some sources[1][2], while others list it as 2.68 g/cm3[3][4] or 2.70 g/cm3[5]. This slight variation may be due to differences in measurement conditions or sample purity.

3. Temperature can affect the density slightly. For example, one source specifies the density as 2.68 g/cm3 at 25°C[3].

4. The bulk density of sodium sulfate powder (as opposed to a single crystal) is typically lower, ranging from 1400-1600 kg/m3 (equivalent to 1.4-1.6 g/cm3)[1][5]. This is because bulk density accounts for the spaces between particles in a powder.

5. The hydrated form (decahydrate) has a lower density due to the incorporation of water molecules in its crystal structure, which increases its volume relative to its mass.

In summary, the density of sodium sulfate is approximately 2.66-2.70 g/cm3 for the anhydrous form and 1.464 g/cm3 for the decahydrate form, with some variation depending on the specific conditions and measurement techniques used.
