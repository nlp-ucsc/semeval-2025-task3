Yusra Mardini grew up in Damascus, Syria[1][3]. Specifically, she lived in Darayya, a suburb of Damascus[2][4]. 

Mardini was born on March 5, 1998, to a Syrian family in Damascus[1][3]. She began swimming at a young age, with her father, who was also a swimmer, introducing her to the sport when she was just four years old[9]. Growing up, Mardini trained in swimming with the support of the Syrian Olympic Committee[1][3].

In Damascus, Mardini had access to Olympic-sized swimming pools for training. She mentioned in an interview that they trained at a 50-meter Olympic pool, and in the summer, they also trained outdoors in another 50-meter pool[8]. This early training in Damascus laid the foundation for her future swimming career.

Mardini's life in Damascus was significantly impacted by the Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011 when she was 13 years old[2]. Despite the challenges posed by the conflict, including the destruction of her family's home, Mardini continued her swimming training in Damascus as much as possible until she fled the country in 2015 at the age of 17[1][6].
