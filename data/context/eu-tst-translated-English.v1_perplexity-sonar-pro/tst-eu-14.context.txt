1. Professional Gardener: This refers to someone hired for their gardening skills and expertise. They have extensive knowledge of plants, soil, and garden maintenance techniques[8].

2. Horticulturist: This term describes a professional who specializes in the science and art of growing plants. Horticulturists often have formal education in plant science and apply scientific knowledge to cultivate and maintain gardens[5][10].

3. Landscape Gardener: This professional focuses on designing, creating, and maintaining larger outdoor spaces, often combining elements of horticulture and landscape architecture[1].

4. Groundskeeper: This term is often used for professionals who maintain larger properties, parks, or institutional grounds[4].

5. Garden Designer: While not always directly involved in maintenance, garden designers create plans for gardens and may oversee their implementation[2].

It's worth noting that the term "gardener" can encompass various levels of expertise, from hobbyists to highly skilled professionals. Some gardeners may also pursue additional certifications, such as becoming a Master Gardener, which involves specialized training and a commitment to community education and volunteer work[10].
