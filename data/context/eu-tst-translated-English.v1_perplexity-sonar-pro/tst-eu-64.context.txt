The Fens plain in eastern England is known by several other names:

1. Fenland(s): This is one of the most common alternative names for the region[1][5].

2. The Fen Country: This term is sometimes used to refer to the broader area encompassing the Fens[2].

3. Fenland Region: A more formal designation for the area.

4. The Holy Land of the English: This poetic nickname refers to the area's historical significance due to its many former monasteries, now churches and cathedrals, such as those in Crowland, Ely, Peterborough, Ramsey, and Thorney[5].

5. Metaris Aestuarium: This was the Roman name for the region, which translates to "The Metaris Estuary," although it's now understood that the area was actually a silted-up bay of the North Sea rather than a river estuary[4].

6. Fen Tiger Country: This nickname comes from the local inhabitants who were known as "Fen Tigers" due to their reputation as fighters[2].

7. The Wash: While technically referring to the bay adjacent to the Fens, this name is sometimes used in connection with the broader Fenland area[1].

It's worth noting that historically, different parts of the Fens had specific names. For example, in Saxon times, the inhabitants were known as Gyrvii, and in the late 17th century, some were called Breedlings[4]. The term "fen" itself is also used to describe individual areas of marshland or former marshland within the larger region[1][5].
