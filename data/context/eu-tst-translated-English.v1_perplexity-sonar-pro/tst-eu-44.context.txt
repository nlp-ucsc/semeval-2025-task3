Plastic Letters is the second studio album by Blondie[1][2]. It was released in February 1978 on Chrysalis Records[1]. This album followed their self-titled debut album "Blondie" and came just seven months before their breakthrough third album "Parallel Lines"[3].

Some key points about Plastic Letters:

1. Production: It was produced by Richard Gottehrer, who also produced their debut album. This would be the final Blondie album he produced[1].

2. Commercial performance: The album peaked at #10 in the UK charts and was certified Platinum by the BPI (British Phonographic Industry)[1].

3. Singles: Two singles from the album achieved success in Europe:
   - "Denis" (a cover of Randy & the Rainbows' 1963 hit "Denise") reached #2 in the UK and #19 in Australia[1].
   - "(I'm Always Touched by Your) Presence, Dear" reached #10 in the UK[1].

4. Band lineup: The album features Chris Stein on lead guitar and bass, Deborah Harry on vocals, Clement Burke on drums, and James Destri on keyboards[2].

5. Musical style: Plastic Letters is considered slightly more adventurous than their debut, continuing with some comic strip and film noir themes that made it "tremendously fun"[3].

While Plastic Letters achieved success in Europe, it's worth noting that the singles from this album did not perform well in the United States, despite the band's later breakthrough in their home country[3].
