The Alamanni, also known as Alemanni or Alamans, were a confederation of Germanic tribes primarily situated in the following regions:

1. Southwestern Germany: They settled in what is now Baden-Württemberg, including areas around the Upper Rhine River and Lake Constance[1][2].

2. Northern Switzerland: The Alamanni occupied territories in present-day German-speaking Switzerland[1][3].

3. Alsace: This region in modern-day France was part of Alamannia[1][2].

4. Parts of Austria: The Austrian state of Vorarlberg was included in Alamannic territory[2].

5. Liechtenstein: This small principality was also part of the Alamannic realm[2].

The Alamanni's territory, known as Alamannia, had the following geographical features and boundaries:

- It was centered around Lake Constance[1].
- It included the High Rhine and Black Forest regions[1].
- The Upper Rhine formed part of its western border[1].
- The upper Danube River basin up to its confluence with the Lech River marked its eastern extent[1].
- To the north, the boundary ran from the Murg River (about 30 km south of Karlsruhe) to Heilbronn and the Nördlinger Ries[1].
- The southern boundary with Burgundy was somewhat unclear but generally followed the lower Aare River before turning south towards the Alps[1].

Initially, the Alamanni settled in the Main River area of Western Germany after migrating from the Baltic Sea region[2]. Over time, they expanded their territory, notably capturing the Agri Decumates (a region between the Rhine, Main, and Danube rivers) from the Romans in 260 CE[3].

It's important to note that the extent of Alamannic territory changed over time due to conflicts with neighboring peoples and empires, particularly the Romans and later the Franks. The area inhabited by the Alamanni roughly corresponds to regions where Alemannic German dialects are still spoken today[1][3].
