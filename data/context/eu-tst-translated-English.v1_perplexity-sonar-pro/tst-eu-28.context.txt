Kate Beckinsale has one sibling - a paternal half-sister named Samantha Beckinsale[2][3][5].

Samantha Beckinsale is also an actress, best known for her role as a firefighter in the 1990s British drama series "London's Burning"[6]. She was born in July 1966 to Kate's father Richard Beckinsale and his first wife Margaret Bradley[5].

Kate and Samantha have different mothers but share the same father. They did not grow up together, as Kate was born to Richard Beckinsale's second wife, Judy Loe. The half-sisters met briefly as children but didn't reconnect until Kate was 21 years old[6].

Kate has spoken about reconnecting with Samantha, saying: "She got in touch and I was a bit nervous of meeting her because I wanted to get on with her. I thought, 'What if she's horrible?' Luckily, she was really nice."[6]

It's worth noting that while Kate has only one biological sibling, she also grew up with step-siblings. When Kate was nine years old, her mother Judy Loe moved in with director Roy Battersby, who brought his own children into the household. Kate has described this as a significant change in her life, saying, "He was a director and moved in with my mom and brought his enormous amount of children, which I was kind of shocked by."[5]
