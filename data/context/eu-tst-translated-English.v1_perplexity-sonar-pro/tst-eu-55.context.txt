Clifford Shull retired from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1986[1][2][4]. Specifically:

1. He joined MIT as a full professor in 1955[1][4].

2. He served as a professor of physics at MIT from 1955 until his retirement in 1986[2][4].

3. After retiring, he became an emeritus professor at MIT[3].

4. Even after retirement, Professor Shull continued to be involved with research at MIT. He would visit and "look over the shoulders" of students conducting experiments in what he called the "remnants of my old research laboratory"[1].

5. Interestingly, Shull was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1994, about 8 years after his retirement[7]. This highlights that his contributions to neutron scattering techniques, particularly his pioneering work done decades earlier, were recognized long after he had formally ended his academic career.
