The name of Garajonay National Park comes from a tragic love story in Guanche folklore about two young lovers named Gara and Jonay[1][2][3]. 

Gara was a princess from La Gomera, while Jonay was a prince from the neighboring island of Tenerife[1][2]. According to the legend, they fell deeply in love when they met during a festival[7]. However, their families opposed their union due to rivalries between the islands[1].

When the Teide volcano on Tenerife erupted, it was seen as a bad omen for their relationship[2]. Their families tried to separate them, sending Jonay back to Tenerife[2]. But Jonay swam back across the channel between the islands to reunite with Gara[2][7].

Pursued by their families, the lovers fled to the highest mountain on La Gomera[1]. Realizing they could not be together, they made a tragic decision - they embraced each other and took their own lives by piercing their hearts with a sharpened branch[3][7].

This mountain where they made their final stand came to be known as Garajonay, combining their names[1][3]. The national park that now covers this area was named after this legendary peak and the star-crossed lovers[7].

The tale of Gara and Jonay has been compared to other famous tragic love stories like Romeo and Juliet[4][7]. It captures the spirit of the park, where nature and human legend are intertwined[1]. The story continues to be an important part of local folklore, giving the park a deeper cultural significance beyond just its natural wonders.
