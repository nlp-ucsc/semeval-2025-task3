Shymkent's founding dates back to the 12th century, though there is evidence of even earlier settlement in the area[1][2][4]. Here are the key points about Shymkent's origins:

Archaeological evidence indicates that the area now known as Shymkent was first settled in the 11th-12th centuries[1]. However, some theories suggest the city may have even earlier origins:

1. Some archaeological findings, including burial sites, date back to the 5th-6th centuries AD[4][7].

2. The city is officially considered to have been founded in 1365[1].

3. There are claims that a settlement existed on the territory of modern Shymkent as early as the 6th century AD[4].

4. The first written mention of Shymkent appears in the 15th century, in a book by Persian historian Sharaf ad-din Yazdi describing Timur's military campaigns[4][7].

5. UNESCO has officially acknowledged Shymkent's 2200-year history, granting it the title of "the most ancient city of Kazakhstan" in 2019[5].

While the exact founding date remains a subject of debate among historians, it is widely accepted that Shymkent has existed as a significant settlement since at least the 12th century. The city's strategic location on the Silk Road contributed to its importance as a caravanserai and trade center, protecting the nearby trade town of Sayram[4].
