Swahili is an official language in several East African countries. Specifically:

1. Tanzania: Swahili is an official language and widely used throughout the country. It is the primary language of instruction in primary schools and is used in government, trade, and daily life[1][2].

2. Kenya: Swahili has been a national language since 1964 and gained official status in 2010. It is a compulsory subject in all Kenyan primary and secondary schools[1].

3. Uganda: In 2022, Uganda adopted Swahili as one of its official languages alongside English. It has also been made compulsory in primary and secondary schools[1].

4. Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC): Swahili is recognized as a national language and is widely spoken in the eastern regions. However, the local dialects in Congo, known as Congo Swahili, differ considerably from Standard Swahili[1].

5. Rwanda: While not explicitly stated in the search results, Rwanda is a member of the East African Community (EAC), where Swahili is one of the three official languages[1].

Additionally, Swahili is one of the working languages of the African Union and the Southern African Development Community[1]. It's worth noting that while Swahili is widely spoken in some other countries like Burundi, Comoros, and parts of Mozambique, it may not have official status in these nations[1][2].

The growing importance of Swahili is further emphasized by the United Nations' decision to designate July 7th as World Kiswahili Language Day, making it the first African language to be recognized in this manner by the UN[4].
