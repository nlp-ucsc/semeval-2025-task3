Ethel Smyth learned and developed a wide range of musical skills and composed across many genres throughout her career:

Ethel Smyth began her musical education at a young age, showing early talent in transposing and playing music by ear[1]. At 17, she started taking formal music lessons from A. Ewing and taught herself orchestration using Berlioz's "Treatise on Instrumentation"[1].

In 1877, at the age of 19, Smyth attended the Leipzig Conservatory, where she studied:

1. Harmony and counterpoint with S. Jadassohn
2. Piano with J. Maas
3. Composition with H. Reinecke[1]

Smyth became the first woman to take composition classes at Leipzig[1]. However, dissatisfied with the teaching climate, she left after one year to study privately with Heinrich von Herzogenberg, a friend of Brahms[1][4].

During her time in Leipzig and later in her career, Smyth learned from and was influenced by several prominent composers:

- She met and learned from composers like Grieg, Dvorak, and Tchaikovsky[1].
- She was introduced to the circle of Brahms and Clara Schumann[1].
- Tchaikovsky advised her to start writing orchestral works and gave her instrumentation advice[4].

Smyth developed skills in multiple areas of composition, including:

1. Chamber music
2. Orchestral works
3. Choral arrangements
4. Opera composition[2]

Her musical style evolved over time, incorporating elements of:

- Romanticism
- Wagnerian influences
- Debussy-inspired techniques
- English folklore[4]

Smyth composed in various genres, including:

1. Symphonies
2. Choral works
3. Chamber music
4. Orchestral pieces
5. Six operas[2][4]

She also wrote vocal scores and was known for her sophisticated musical compositions that earned praise from her contemporaries[3][4].

Throughout her career, Smyth continued to learn and develop her craft, creating an impressive and diverse oeuvre that showcased her skills in large-scale choral and orchestral works, as well as more intimate chamber pieces[4].
