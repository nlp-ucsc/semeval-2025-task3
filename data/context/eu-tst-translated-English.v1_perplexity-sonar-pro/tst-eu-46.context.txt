The number that comes after one hundred fifty is one hundred fifty-one[1][2]. 

To understand this better, let's break it down:

1. One hundred fifty is written as 150 in numerals.
2. The next number in sequence would be 150 + 1 = 151.
3. In words, 151 is spelled out as "one hundred fifty-one"[1].

This follows the pattern for writing numbers between 100 and 200:

- We start with "one hundred" to indicate we're in the hundreds.
- Then we add the tens and ones place, which in this case is "fifty-one".

It's worth noting that when writing out numbers:
- We use hyphens for compound numbers from twenty-one to ninety-nine[2].
- We don't use the word "and" between the hundreds and the rest of the number in American English (though it's common in British English).

So, to recap:
150 = one hundred fifty
151 = one hundred fifty-one

The pattern continues with:
152 = one hundred fifty-two
153 = one hundred fifty-three
And so on...
