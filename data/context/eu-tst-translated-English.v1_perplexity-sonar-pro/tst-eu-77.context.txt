Pietro Nenni was a prominent Italian socialist politician who played a significant role in shaping Italy's political landscape throughout much of the 20th century. His political ideology can be characterized as follows:

1. Democratic socialism: Nenni was a key figure in the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), advocating for socialist policies within a democratic framework[2][3].

2. Anti-fascism: He was a staunch opponent of Benito Mussolini's fascist regime, which led to his exile and imprisonment during the fascist era[2][3].

3. Evolving stance on communism: Initially, Nenni favored close ties between the PSI and the Italian Communist Party (PCI). However, he broke with the communists in 1956 after the Soviet invasion of Hungary, leading to a significant shift in his political alignment[1][2].

4. Neutralism and pacifism: In the early stages of the Cold War, Nenni opposed Italy's entry into NATO, favoring a policy of neutrality. He feared that NATO membership could reignite civil conflict in Italy[2].

5. Gradual shift towards center-left: In the 1960s, Nenni facilitated an "opening to the center-left," enabling coalition governments between the PSI and the Christian Democrats. This move brought socialists back into office for the first time since 1947[2].

6. Support for European integration: While initially skeptical, Nenni eventually came to support Italy's participation in the European integration process.

7. Republican advocacy: Nenni was a strong proponent of establishing a republic in Italy, playing a vital role in the successful campaign for a republican constitution after World War II[3].

Throughout his career, Nenni's political ideology evolved in response to changing national and international circumstances. He moved from a more radical socialist position in his early years to a more moderate, center-left stance in his later career, always maintaining his commitment to democratic principles and social justice.
