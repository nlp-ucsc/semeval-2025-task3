Based on the search results provided, there isn't a clear answer about who specifically built the very first house in Rosario, Argentina. However, we can piece together some information about the early settlement of the area:

The earliest permanent settlement in what would become Rosario was established by Luis Romero de Piñeda in the late 17th century. In 1689, Romero de Piñeda received lands in the area known as Pago de los Arroyos by royal decree. He set up the first permanent settlement there, which was an estancia (a large rural estate) intended as farmland rather than a town[1].

Following this, in 1719, the Jesuits bought another part of the land and established Estancia San Miguel[1].

In 1724, another colonial settlement was initiated by Santiago de Montenegro. He set up a mill, drew plans for the future town, built a chapel, and was appointed mayor in 1751[1].

While these individuals were among the earliest settlers and developers of the area, the search results don't specify who constructed the very first house. It's likely that simple dwellings were built as part of these early settlements, but without more detailed historical records, we can't pinpoint the exact first house or its builder.

The city of Rosario itself didn't have a clear foundation date, but most commentators state that Rosario was founded on October 7, 1793, with a local population of 457 inhabitants[1]. However, it wasn't officially declared a city until August 3, 1852[1].
