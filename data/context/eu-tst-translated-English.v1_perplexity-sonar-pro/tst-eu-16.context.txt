Holy Thursday, also known as Maundy Thursday, is a significant day in the Catholic liturgical calendar that commemorates several important events from the last days of Jesus Christ's life. The Catholic Church celebrates the following on Holy Thursday:

1. The Last Supper: Holy Thursday marks the anniversary of the Last Supper, where Jesus shared his final Passover meal with his disciples[1][2]. This event is central to the celebration, as it established the foundation for the Eucharist.

2. Institution of the Eucharist: During the Last Supper, Jesus instituted the sacrament of the Eucharist by sharing bread and wine with his disciples, saying, "This is my body" and "This is my blood"[1][2]. Catholics believe that through this act, Jesus established the sacrament of Holy Communion.

3. Institution of the Priesthood: The Catholic Church also commemorates the institution of the sacrament of Holy Orders (priesthood) on this day[1][3]. Jesus commanded his disciples to "Do this in memory of me," thereby establishing the priestly ministry.

4. Washing of the Feet: The Holy Thursday liturgy often includes the ritual of the washing of feet, which reenacts Jesus' humble act of washing his disciples' feet[2][4]. This ceremony emphasizes the importance of service and humility in Christian life.

5. Mass of the Lord's Supper: A special evening Mass is celebrated on Holy Thursday, known as the Mass of the Lord's Supper[2][7]. This Mass marks the end of Lent and the beginning of the Easter Triduum, the three most solemn days in the Catholic liturgical year.

6. Eucharistic Adoration: After the Mass of the Lord's Supper, the Blessed Sacrament is transferred to an "altar of repose," where the faithful are invited to spend time in adoration[2][3]. This practice recalls Jesus' agony in the Garden of Gethsemane.

7. Stripping of the Altars: Following the Mass, the altars are stripped bare, symbolizing the abandonment of Jesus by his disciples and his impending crucifixion[4].

8. Chrism Mass: In many dioceses, a special Chrism Mass is celebrated on the morning of Holy Thursday, where the bishop blesses the holy oils used for sacraments throughout the year[1][4].

Holy Thursday is a day rich in symbolism and tradition, marking the beginning of the Easter Triduum and inviting Catholics to reflect deeply on the mysteries of their faith, particularly the gift of the Eucharist and the example of Christ's sacrificial love and service.
