The breeding season for Purple Martins, which are the most common martin species in North America, typically occurs during spring and summer. Here are the key details about their breeding timeline:

## Arrival and Nest Preparation

Purple Martins begin arriving at their breeding grounds in stages:

- In the southern United States, they can arrive as early as January or February[5][9].
- In more northern areas, they typically arrive between late March and early May[1][3].

Adult birds, especially males, arrive first to establish territories and select nesting sites. Younger birds (subadults) usually arrive about a month later[3].

## Nesting and Egg-Laying

Once pairs have formed and nesting sites are selected, the breeding process begins:

- Nest building can start soon after arrival if weather conditions are favorable[3].
- In most areas, egg-laying occurs from mid-April through July[2].
- The peak of egg-laying activity is typically during the second half of May and early June[1].

## Incubation and Fledging

- Females incubate 3-7 white eggs for 15-18 days[3][4].
- After hatching, nestlings remain in the nest for about 26-32 days before fledging[3][4].
- Fledging usually occurs by mid-July for early nests, though it can extend into August for later nests[1].

## Regional and Age Variations

- Older adult birds tend to nest earlier, from May to June.
- Younger subadults often nest later, from June to July[3].
- In Ohio, for example, most clutches are laid during the second half of May and early June, with young martins hatching by late June and fledging during mid-July[1].

## Post-Breeding Activities

- Purple Martins typically raise only one brood per season[1][3].
- After nesting, they form large roosts away from the nesting colonies[2].
- Fall migration begins in late August or September[2][3].

It's worth noting that the precise timing can vary depending on latitude, local climate conditions, and individual colony characteristics. Additionally, adverse weather conditions during the breeding season can significantly impact nesting success and timing[1][3].
