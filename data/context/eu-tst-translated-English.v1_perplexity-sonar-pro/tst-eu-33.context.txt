The Comoros has three official languages recognized under its 2001 constitution: Comorian (also called Shikomoro), French, and Arabic[1][2]. However, language use varies across Comorian society, with Comorian being the most widely spoken language.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the main languages:

1. Comorian (Shikomoro):
   - The most widely spoken language, used by 96.9% of the population[1][2].
   - A Bantu language closely related to Swahili[2].
   - Has four main dialects, each associated with a different island:
     - Shingazija: Spoken on Grande Comore by about 312,000 people[1].
     - Shimwali: Spoken on Moheli by about 29,000 people[1].
     - Shinzwani: Spoken on Anjouan by about 275,000 people[1].
     - Shimaore: Spoken on Mayotte (a disputed territory claimed by Comoros but administered by France)[6].

2. French:
   - The second most spoken language, used by 25.97% of the population as of 2018[1][2].
   - Used in government, commerce, and education[1][2].
   - Introduced during the French colonial period (1841-1975)[2].

3. Arabic:
   - An official language but not widely spoken as a first language[1][2].
   - Primarily used in religious contexts, as 95% of the population is Sunni Muslim[1][2].
   - Also used in education, particularly in Quranic schools[2].

Additionally, there are minority languages spoken in the Comoros:

4. Malagasy:
   - A dialect called Shibushi is spoken by an estimated 39,000 people[1][3].
   - Mainly found on the islands of Mayotte and Moheli[1].

5. Swahili:
   - Historically served as a lingua franca for trade[1][2].
   - Estimated to be spoken by about 1% of the population[1].
   - The Kiunguja dialect is spoken particularly on Grande Comore[1].

6. English:
   - Used in some informal settings, but not widely spoken[4].

The linguistic diversity in the Comoros reflects its rich history as part of Indian Ocean trade routes and its colonial past[2]. Multilingualism is common, with many Comorians speaking at least two of the official languages in addition to minority languages[2].
