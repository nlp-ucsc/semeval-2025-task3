If the position of president of the Spanish government (also known as prime minister) were to become vacant, the following process would occur:

1. Immediate succession: The deputy prime minister would temporarily take over day-to-day operations as acting prime minister[3].

2. Nomination process: The King of Spain, after consulting with all political groups represented in the Congress of Deputies, would propose a candidate for the presidency through the Speaker of Congress[1].

3. Investiture proceedings: The nominated candidate would present their political program to the Congress of Deputies and request a vote of confidence[1][3].

4. Confidence vote: The Congress would then vote on the candidate:
   - If the candidate receives an absolute majority (currently 176 out of 350 MPs), they are appointed as the new prime minister[1][3].
   - If an absolute majority is not achieved, a second vote is held 48 hours later where only a simple majority (more "yes" than "no" votes) is required[1][3].

5. Failure to elect: If no candidate receives confidence after two months, the King dissolves Parliament and calls for new general elections[1][3].

6. Appointment: Once a candidate receives the necessary confidence, the King formally appoints them as the new president of the Government[1].

It's important to note that Spain's system is designed to ensure governmental stability:

- The prime minister can only be removed through a constructive vote of no confidence, where an alternative candidate must be proposed simultaneously[3].
- If the prime minister resigns, dies, or becomes incapacitated, the entire government resigns, triggering the nomination and appointment process[3].

This process underscores the parliamentary nature of Spain's political system, where the government's legitimacy is derived from and accountable to the legislature[1][3].
