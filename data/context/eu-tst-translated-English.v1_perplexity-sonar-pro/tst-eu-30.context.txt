An armistice is a formal agreement to cease fighting between warring parties, typically serving as a prelude to peace negotiations. The key aspects of armistice policy include:

1. Cessation of hostilities: The primary purpose of an armistice is to stop active combat operations between belligerents[1][2]. This can be local (limited to a specific area) or general (covering all fronts)[1].

2. Temporary nature: An armistice suspends hostilities but does not formally end the state of war[1][2]. It allows for a period of negotiation while preventing further bloodshed.

3. Terms and conditions: Armistice agreements typically include specific terms that both parties must adhere to, such as:

   - Withdrawal of forces from occupied territories[3][4]
   - Surrender of military equipment and resources[4]
   - Release of prisoners of war[3][4]
   - Demobilization of armed forces[3]
   - Establishment of neutral zones or buffer areas[4]

4. Duration: Armistices can be time-limited or indefinite. If no duration is specified, parties may resume operations with proper warning[1].

5. Violations and consequences: Serious violations of armistice terms by one party may allow the other to denounce the agreement and resume hostilities[1].

6. Negotiation process: Armistice talks are typically initiated by governments and conducted by high-ranking military or political officials[1][4].

7. Broader implications: While primarily a military agreement, armistices can include political, economic, or territorial clauses, as seen in the 1918 Armistice ending World War I[2][4].

8. Path to peace: Armistices often serve as stepping stones to more comprehensive peace treaties, allowing time for detailed negotiations while hostilities are suspended[2][7].

9. International law: The general rules regarding armistices are codified in international law, such as the Hague Conventions[2].

10. Flexibility: Armistice agreements can be adapted or prolonged as needed to facilitate the peace process, as demonstrated by the multiple extensions of the 1918 Armistice[4].

In practice, armistice policies aim to create conditions conducive to lasting peace while addressing immediate security concerns. They provide a framework for de-escalation and transition from active conflict to diplomatic resolution of disputes.
