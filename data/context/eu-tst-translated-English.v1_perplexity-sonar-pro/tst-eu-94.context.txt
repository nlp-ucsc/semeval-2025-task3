Bahram I was the fourth Sasanian King of Kings (Shahanshah) of Iran, ruling from 271 to 274 CE[1][2]. Here are the key details about his life and reign:

## Background and Ascension

- Bahram I was the eldest son of Shapur I, who ruled from 240-270 CE[2].
- Despite being the oldest, he was initially not considered a candidate for succession by his father[4].
- During Shapur's reign, Bahram served as the governor of Gilan, holding the title "Gelan Shah" (King of Gilan)[4].
- He succeeded his brother Hormizd I, who had only ruled for about a year[1][4].

## Reign and Policies

Bahram I's short reign was marked by a few significant events:

1. **Religious Policy**: Unlike previous Sasanian rulers who practiced religious tolerance, Bahram I reversed this policy[4].
   - He allied with the Zoroastrian high priest Kartir[1][3].
   - In 274 CE, he ordered the arrest and execution of Mani, the founder of Manichaeism[1][2][3].
   - This led to persecution of Manichaeans, Christians, and Buddhists[3].

2. **Administration**: 
   - He made a settlement with his younger brother Narseh, who gave up his claim to the throne in exchange for governing Armenia[4].

3. **Insignia and Representation**:
   - His coins depict him wearing a crown adorned with ray-shaped spikes, characteristic of Mithra[5].
   - A rock relief at Bishapur shows him on horseback receiving the diadem of royalty from Ohrmezd[5].

## Legacy and Historical Assessment

- Bahram I's reign was relatively short and uneventful apart from his religious policies[2][5].
- His execution of Mani marked the end of Sasanian tolerance towards Manichaeism[2].
- He is generally not considered one of the more notable Sasanian rulers, with ancient historian Agathias describing him as unremarkable[7].

Bahram I died in September 274 CE and was succeeded by his son, Bahram II[4]. His reign, while brief, set the stage for increased influence of the Zoroastrian clergy in the Sasanian Empire.
