Victoire Tomegah Dogbé, the Prime Minister of Togo, speaks French[1][3]. As the official language of Togo is French, it is expected that high-ranking government officials like Dogbé would be fluent in the language[3]. 

There is no clear evidence that she speaks English. In fact, one source specifically mentions that it couldn't be confirmed whether she speaks English[1]. However, it's worth noting that Togo has recently joined the Commonwealth, which may create opportunities for Togolese citizens, including government officials, to learn English in the future[3].

Additionally, given her extensive experience working with international organizations like the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and her role as Prime Minister, it's possible that Dogbé may have some knowledge of other languages, but French is the only one explicitly confirmed in the available information[1][4].

It's also important to note that Togo, recognizing the importance of English in global affairs, has recently announced plans to introduce English language education in primary schools starting from the 2023-2024 school year[2]. This initiative aims to equip young learners with essential English language skills, which aligns with Togo's strategy to diversify its global trade following its inclusion in the Commonwealth[2].
