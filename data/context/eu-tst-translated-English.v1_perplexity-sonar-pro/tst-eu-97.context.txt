The main purpose of the Second Council of Nicaea, held in 787 AD, was to address and resolve the iconoclastic controversy by restoring the use and veneration of icons (holy images) in Christian worship and practice[1][5].

Specifically, the council aimed to:

1. Overturn the earlier iconoclast Council of Hieria (754 AD), which had banned the use of religious images[1][5].

2. Establish the theological justification for the veneration of icons, distinguishing it from idolatry[6].

3. Restore unity to the Church, which had been divided over the issue of iconoclasm[7].

The council was convened by Empress Irene and her son Emperor Constantine VI, and was presided over by Patriarch Tarasios of Constantinople, along with papal legates representing Pope Adrian I[1][5]. It was attended by 308-350 bishops and other clergy members[1].

The council's key outcomes included:

1. Approving the veneration of icons and declaring it theologically sound[1][5].

2. Distinguishing between the veneration of icons (proskynesis) and the worship reserved for God alone (latria)[6].

3. Issuing a definition of faith that affirmed the production and use of religious images in churches[4].

4. Promulgating 22 canons related to church discipline and reform[8].

The Second Council of Nicaea is recognized as the Seventh Ecumenical Council by both the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches, marking it as a significant event in Christian history[5]. Its decisions played a crucial role in shaping Christian art and worship practices, particularly in the Eastern Orthodox tradition, where the council's teachings continue to be celebrated annually as the "Triumph of Orthodoxy"[5].
