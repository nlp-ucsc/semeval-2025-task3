Tuvalu has a tropical climate characterized by consistently warm temperatures and high humidity throughout the year, with distinct wet and dry seasons. Here are the key aspects of Tuvalu's climate:

## Temperature

Tuvalu experiences little variation in temperature throughout the year[1][2]:

- Maximum temperatures typically range between 31-32°C (88-90°F)
- Minimum temperatures usually fall between 25-26°C (77-79°F)

The consistently warm temperatures are largely due to Tuvalu's location near the equator and its proximity to the West Pacific Warm Pool[2].

## Rainfall

Tuvalu has two distinct seasons[1][2]:

- Wet season: November to April
- Dry season: May to October

However, even during the dry season, Tuvalu receives significant rainfall:

- Funafuti (the capital) averages more than 200 mm of rain each month
- Nanumea averages more than 160 mm of rain each month

Annual rainfall varies across the islands[8]:

- Northern islands: around 2,700 mm per year
- Southern islands (including Funafuti): up to 3,500 mm per year

The high rainfall is due to Tuvalu's location near the South Pacific Convergence Zone, an area of intense thunderstorm activity[2].

## Climate Influences

Several climate systems affect Tuvalu's weather patterns[3]:

- Trade winds
- South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ)
- El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
- West Pacific Monsoon

El Niño events tend to bring wetter and warmer conditions, while La Niña events usually result in drier and cooler weather[2].

## Extreme Weather Events

Tuvalu is vulnerable to several types of extreme weather events:

- Tropical cyclones (November to April)[2]
- King tides (perigean spring tides)[3]
- Storm surges[3]

These events can cause significant flooding and damage to the low-lying atolls.

## Climate Change Impacts

Tuvalu is particularly vulnerable to climate change effects[3][5]:

- Rising sea levels (increasing at about 5 mm per year since 1993)
- Increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events
- Potential changes in rainfall patterns
- Ocean acidification

These changes pose significant threats to Tuvalu's long-term habitability, with some projections suggesting that large portions of the islands could be regularly flooded by mid-century[3].

In summary, Tuvalu's climate is characterized by warm temperatures, high rainfall, and significant vulnerability to climate change impacts due to its low-lying geography and location in the Pacific Ocean.
