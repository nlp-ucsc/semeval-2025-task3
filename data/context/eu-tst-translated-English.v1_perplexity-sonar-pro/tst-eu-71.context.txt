Count Carlo Gozzi vigorously defended the traditional Italian theatrical genre of Commedia dell'arte[1][3][5]. 

Commedia dell'arte was a form of improvised theater that relied on stock characters and scenarios rather than fully scripted plays. In the mid-18th century, this traditional style was being challenged by more modern, realistic theatrical forms promoted by playwrights like Carlo Goldoni and Pietro Chiari[1][3].

Gozzi saw these new styles as a threat to Italian theatrical traditions. In 1757, he published a satirical poem called "La tartana degli influssi per l'anno 1756" to defend Commedia dell'arte[5]. He followed this in 1761 with his play "The Love for Three Oranges" (L'amore delle tre melarance), which parodied the works of Goldoni and Chiari while showcasing Commedia dell'arte techniques[1][5].

Gozzi went on to write a series of theatrical fairy tales (fiabe teatrali) that incorporated elements of Commedia dell'arte. These works, which blended fantasy, satire, and traditional performance styles, helped revive interest in Commedia dell'arte for a time[1][3]. 

By championing this traditional form, Gozzi was not only defending a theatrical style but also advocating for the preservation of established social hierarchies and cultural norms in Venice, in opposition to the more progressive ideas represented by Goldoni's realistic comedies[3].
