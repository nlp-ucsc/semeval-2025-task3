The Senegal national football team currently plays its home matches primarily at two stadiums:

1. Diamniadio Olympic Stadium (also known as Stade Abdoulaye Wade)[1][3][5][7]
   - This is the newer and main home stadium for the team
   - Located in Diamniadio, about 30 km southeast of Dakar
   - Opened in 2022
   - Capacity of 50,000 spectators
   - Built as part of preparations for the 2026 Dakar Youth Olympics
   - Meets FIFA and CAF standards for international matches

2. Stade Léopold Sédar Senghor[2][4][10]
   - Located in Dakar
   - Opened in 1985
   - Larger capacity of 60,000-80,000 (sources vary on exact capacity)
   - Previously the main national stadium before Diamniadio was built
   - Still used for some matches

The Diamniadio Olympic Stadium has become the primary venue for important matches since its opening, hosting World Cup qualifiers and Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers[5][6]. However, the Léopold Sédar Senghor Stadium is still used occasionally, likely for matches expecting larger crowds or when the main stadium is unavailable.

It's worth noting that Senegal sometimes plays home matches at neutral venues outside the country as well, particularly for friendly matches[6][8]. But for official competitions, the team primarily uses the two stadiums mentioned above, with a clear preference for the newer Diamniadio Olympic Stadium in recent years.
