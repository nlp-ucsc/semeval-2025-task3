Kaiser Chiefs are from Leeds, England. The band was formed in Leeds in 2000[1][3][5]. Specifically:

- The original members met at St. Mary's Catholic High School in Menston, West Yorkshire, near Leeds[5].
- They initially formed as Runston Parva in 1996, then reformed as Parva in 2000, before finally establishing themselves as Kaiser Chiefs in 2003[5].
- The band's name was inspired by South African football club Kaizer Chiefs, which was the first club of ex-Leeds United captain Lucas Radebe[5].

Throughout their career, Kaiser Chiefs have maintained strong ties to their hometown of Leeds. For example:

- They've played significant hometown shows, including two sold-out concerts at Kirkstall Abbey in Leeds in September 2011[5].
- In 2008, they released a DVD of their live performance at Elland Road, the home stadium of Leeds United football club, where they played to a sold-out crowd of 40,000 people[5].

The band's Leeds origins have been an important part of their identity and have influenced their music and career trajectory as they became one of the leading indie rock bands to emerge from the UK in the 2000s[1][3].
