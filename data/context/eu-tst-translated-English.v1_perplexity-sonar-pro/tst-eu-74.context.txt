Gunnar Asplund, the renowned Swedish architect, died on October 20, 1940, in Stockholm, Sweden[1][2][3]. He was 55 years old at the time of his death[1][5].

Asplund was born on September 22, 1885, in Stockholm, Sweden[1][2][5]. He had a significant impact on architecture during his lifetime, particularly in the transition from Neoclassical to modern design. Some of his most notable works include:

1. The Stockholm Public Library (1924-1928)[2][5]
2. The Stockholm Exposition of 1930[1][3]
3. The Woodland Crematorium in Stockholm (1935-1940)[1][3]

Asplund's career was marked by a shift in architectural styles. He began with a more classical approach, influenced by his travels to Greece and Italy in 1913-1914[1]. However, by the late 1920s, he had embraced modernism, as exemplified in his work for the Stockholm Exposition of 1930[3].

In the years leading up to his death, Asplund was highly active in his profession. He had been appointed as a professor of architecture at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm in 1931[2][5]. His final major work, the Woodland Crematorium, is considered one of his masterpieces and was completed in the year of his death[1][3].

Tragically, Asplund's life was cut short just three years after completing his summer residence in the Stockholm archipelago in 1937[6]. Despite his relatively early death, Gunnar Asplund left a lasting legacy in the field of architecture, influencing generations of architects in Sweden and beyond.
