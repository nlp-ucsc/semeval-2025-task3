The word "collage" comes from the French word "coller," which means "to glue" or "to stick together"[1][2][3]. This etymology reflects the fundamental technique of collage art, which involves assembling different elements by gluing them onto a surface[4].

The term was popularized in the early 20th century, particularly in the context of modern art movements. Cubist artists Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso played a significant role in bringing collage to prominence as an artistic technique around 1912[2][3]. They used the technique to challenge traditional notions of painting and representation, incorporating everyday materials like newspaper clippings and wallpaper into their artworks[4].

While Braque and Picasso popularized the term and technique in the context of fine art, the practice of assembling different materials onto a surface has a much longer history. Early forms of collage-like techniques can be traced back to:

1. Ancient China, around 200 BC, following the invention of paper[5].
2. 10th century Japan, where calligraphers began applying glued paper with texts to surfaces when writing poems[5].
3. Medieval Europe during the 13th century, with gold leaf panels being applied in Gothic cathedrals[5].

It's worth noting that while the French term "collage" became widely used in the art world in the early 20th century, related terms like "papier coll√©" (pasted paper) were also used to describe specific collage techniques[2][7]. The adoption of collage as an artistic method marked a significant shift in modern art, challenging traditional boundaries between high and low culture and expanding the possibilities of artistic expression[6][7].
