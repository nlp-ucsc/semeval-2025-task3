Cladoniaceae fungi, including species in the genus Cladonia, generally grow more abundantly in cold climates rather than warm climates. This family of lichen-forming fungi shows a clear preference for cooler, more humid environments. Here are the key points supporting this:

1. Global distribution: Cladoniaceae are globally distributed but favor temperate and boreal regions. They are found from Arctic tundra to tropical rainforests, but are most abundant in colder areas[1][2].

2. Climate preference: These lichens thrive best in humid conditions and are generally intolerant of arid environments. They are adapted to extreme conditions of high light and low moisture, which are often found in colder climates[1][2].

3. Habitat range: Cladoniaceae species are commonly found in boreal forests, tundra ecosystems, temperate forests, and Arctic and Antarctic regions. They are less common in warmer, tropical lowlands[2].

4. Species diversity: The highest diversity of Cladonia species in western North America is found between 52°N and 56°N latitude in British Columbia, an area with a cooler climate[2].

5. Specific examples:
   - Reindeer lichens (e.g., Cladonia rangiferina) are abundant in cold tundra regions and taiga ecosystems[3].
   - Cladonia stellaris is an indicator of alpine tundra and boreal climates[4].
   - Many Cladonia species are adapted to harsh winter conditions and can survive temperatures as low as -40°C[5].

6. Warm climate limitations: In warmer regions, Cladoniaceae are often restricted to higher elevations or specific microclimates that provide cooler, moister conditions. For example, in the Mediterranean region, Cladonia species are more commonly found in open Pinus and Quercus forests or road banks, rather than in warmer, drier lowland areas[8].

While some Cladoniaceae species can be found in warmer climates, they are generally less abundant and diverse in these regions compared to colder areas. The family's preference for cool, humid conditions makes cold climates more favorable for their growth and proliferation.
