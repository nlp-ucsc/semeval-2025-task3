The Sweet Chestnut tree (Castanea sativa) has distinctive flowers that appear in early to mid-summer, typically in June or July[1][4]. Here are the key characteristics of Sweet Chestnut flowers:

1. Catkin structure:
   - The flowers are arranged in long, upright catkins that can reach 10-20 cm (4-8 inches) in length[1][9].
   - These catkins contain both male and female flowers, making the tree monoecious[1][2].

2. Male flowers:
   - The male flowers are located in the upper and middle portions of the catkins[1][2].
   - They appear as long, yellowish-green or golden "tassels"[1][4].
   - The male flowers produce both pollen and nectar[7].

3. Female flowers:
   - Female flowers are found at the base of the catkins[1][2].
   - They are smaller and less conspicuous than the male flowers[3].
   - They appear as small green rosettes[4].

4. Pollination:
   - Sweet Chestnut is primarily wind-pollinated, but insects, especially bees, are attracted to the flowers due to their strong fragrance and nectar production[4][7].
   - The tree is largely self-incompatible, meaning cross-pollination between different trees is necessary for proper fruit development[9].

5. Flowering timing:
   - Male and female flowers on the same tree often mature at different times to reduce self-pollination[7].
   - There is usually a small overlap of about a day or so in the most fertile trees[7].

6. Appearance and fragrance:
   - The catkins have a distinct, strong fragrance that attracts pollinators[6].
   - While not as visually striking as some other flowering trees, the long catkins can be quite noticeable when in full bloom[4].

After pollination, the female flowers develop into the familiar spiky, green seed cases that contain the edible chestnuts[1]. These mature and fall to the ground in autumn, typically around October[1][9].
