Pachychilon pictum, commonly known as the Albanian roach, belongs to the family Leuciscidae, which is part of the larger group of ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii)[1][7]. 

Some key points about the classification of Pachychilon pictum:

1. Family: Leuciscidae (Chub family)[1]

2. Order: Cypriniformes (Carps)[1]

3. Class: Teleostei (Ray-finned fishes)[1]

4. Superclass: Osteichthyes (Bony fishes)[1]

It's worth noting that the Leuciscidae family was previously considered part of the larger Cyprinidae family (minnows and carps)[10]. However, recent taxonomic revisions have separated Leuciscidae as a distinct family. This explains why some sources may still list Pachychilon pictum under Cyprinidae.

The Leuciscidae family includes various minnows and chubs, primarily found in Europe and North America. Pachychilon pictum shares characteristics with other members of this family, such as its freshwater habitat and certain anatomical features typical of leuciscid fishes[1][3].
