Joel Hastings Metcalf discovered the asteroid 661 Cloelia on February 22, 1908[1]. Metcalf was an American astronomer, humanitarian, and Unitarian minister who discovered or co-discovered several comets and 41 asteroids between 1905 and 1914[4]. 661 Cloelia was among the many asteroids he discovered during this productive period of astronomical observation.

Metcalf made this discovery while serving as a minister in Taunton, Massachusetts[4]. He was known for his skill in asteroid detection, having developed new photographic methods to aid in the discovery of these small celestial bodies[4]. 661 Cloelia is a main-belt asteroid, orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter[1].

The asteroid was named after Cloelia, a legendary Roman heroine known for her bravery during the early days of the Roman Republic[5]. This naming follows the common practice of christening asteroids after figures from mythology or history.
