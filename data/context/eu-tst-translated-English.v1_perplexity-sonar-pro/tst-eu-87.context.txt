The HMY Britannia is currently permanently berthed at Ocean Terminal in Leith, Edinburgh, Scotland[1][2]. After being decommissioned from royal service in 1997, the ship was converted into a visitor attraction and museum ship[1][5].

Some key details about its current location and status:

1. It is moored at the historic Port of Leith in Edinburgh[1].

2. The entrance to visit the yacht is located inside the Ocean Terminal shopping center[4][5].

3. It has been open to the public as a museum since 1998[6].

4. The Royal Yacht Britannia Trust, a registered charity, now owns and maintains the ship[1].

5. It has become one of Edinburgh's top tourist attractions, welcoming over 300,000 visitors annually[1][5].

6. Visitors can tour five decks of the ship, including the State Apartments, crew quarters, and engine room[3][5].

7. The ship is fully accessible for wheelchair users and those with limited mobility[5].

8. A Royal Deck Tearoom has been added on board for visitors to enjoy refreshments[1][5].

The Britannia's location in Edinburgh was chosen after the city won a competition to provide a permanent home for the decommissioned royal yacht[2]. Its positioning in Leith coincided with redevelopment efforts in the area and the advent of Scottish devolution[1].
