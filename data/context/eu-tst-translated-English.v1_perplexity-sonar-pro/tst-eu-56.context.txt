Publius Quinctilius Varus died by suicide in September 9 AD during the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest[1][4]. As the Roman forces under his command were being overwhelmed by Germanic tribes led by Arminius, Varus took his own life to avoid capture and disgrace[1][4].

Specifically, upon realizing that all hope was lost for his legions, Varus fell on his sword[1]. This was a common method of suicide for Roman generals facing defeat, as it was seen as an honorable way to die rather than be captured by the enemy[1][4].

The battle lasted several days, with the Roman forces being progressively trapped and decimated[5]. On what was likely the third or fourth day of fighting, as the remaining Roman troops were in a desperate situation, Varus made the decision to end his life[5][9]. 

After his death, the Germanic leader Arminius had Varus' head cut off and sent to Bohemia as a gift for another Germanic king, though it was eventually returned to Rome for burial[1]. Varus' suicide marked the complete destruction of three Roman legions and was considered one of the worst military disasters in Roman history[7].
