Denis Sassou-Nguesso came to power in 1979 through a military takeover following a period of political instability in the Republic of Congo. Here are the key details of his rise to power:

1. Military background: Sassou-Nguesso joined the Congolese army in 1960 and rose through the ranks, becoming a colonel by the early 1970s[1].

2. Political involvement: He joined the Congolese Labour Party (PCT), which was the country's sole ruling party embracing a Marxist-Leninist ideology[1].

3. Predecessor's assassination: In March 1977, President Marien Ngouabi was assassinated, leading to a period of political uncertainty[1][3].

4. Interim leadership: Following Ngouabi's death, Joachim Yhombi-Opango came to power and appointed Sassou-Nguesso as first vice president of the PCT's military committee[1].

5. Forced resignation: In February 1979, Yhombi-Opango was forced to resign[1].

6. Appointment as president: The following month, in March 1979, the PCT appointed Sassou-Nguesso as president of the republic and head of the party[1][6].

7. Consolidation of power: On July 8, 1979, elections were held, and Sassou-Nguesso was elected president, further legitimizing his position[6].

Sassou-Nguesso's rise to power in 1979 marked the beginning of his first period of rule, which lasted until 1992. During this time, he maintained one-party rule as head of the Congolese Workers' Party, establishing a dictatorship enforced by political repression[4][9].
