The Thin Red Line did not win any Academy Awards (Oscars)[1][5][7]. Despite being nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Sound, the film did not secure a win in any category[1][6].

The film was highly acclaimed and received numerous nominations and awards from other organizations:

1. It won the Golden Bear at the 1999 Berlin International Film Festival[1].

2. Terrence Malick won Best Director at the New York Film Critics Circle Awards[1].

3. John Toll won Best Cinematography at the New York Film Critics Circle Awards and the National Society of Film Critics Awards[1].

4. The film received several Satellite Awards, including Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Director for Terrence Malick, and Best Cinematography for John Toll[1].

Despite its critical acclaim and numerous accolades, The Thin Red Line's lack of Oscar wins has been noted by some as a significant oversight. The film was released in the same year as Saving Private Ryan, which may have impacted its chances at the Academy Awards[5].
