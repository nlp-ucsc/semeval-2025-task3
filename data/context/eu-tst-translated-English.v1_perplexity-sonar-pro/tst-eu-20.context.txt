The Amazon River is the largest river in the Amazon rainforest and the largest river in the world by water volume[1][3]. Here are some key details about the Amazon River:

Length:
The Amazon River is approximately 6,800 kilometers (4,225 miles) long[3]. This makes it one of the longest rivers in the world, rivaling the Nile River for the title of longest river. The exact length has been debated by scientists and explorers for decades due to difficulties in determining the precise source and mouth of the river[3].

Water volume:
The Amazon River carries the largest volume of water of any river in the world[1]. It discharges an average of 209,000 cubic meters (7,400,000 cubic feet) of water per second into the Atlantic Ocean[1]. During the rainy season, this can increase to up to 300,000 cubic meters (11,000,000 cubic feet) per second[1].

Basin size:
The Amazon basin is the largest river basin in the world, covering approximately 7,050,000 square kilometers (2,720,000 square miles)[1]. This represents about 40% of South America's land area[1].

Tributaries:
The Amazon River has over 1,100 tributaries, with 12 of them being over 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) long[1]. Some major tributaries include the Negro, Madeira, Tapajós, Xingu, and Ucayali rivers[1][4].

Ecosystem impact:
The Amazon River plays a crucial role in supporting the vast Amazon rainforest ecosystem. Its annual flooding cycle enriches the soil of the surrounding floodplains, known as várzeas, which cover an area of up to 350,000 square kilometers (140,000 square miles) during the wet season[1].

Human impact:
The river serves as a vital transportation route and water source for millions of people living in the Amazon basin. It also influences global climate patterns and contributes significantly to the Earth's freshwater cycle[4].
