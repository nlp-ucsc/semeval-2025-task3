The Danish Golden Age, a period of exceptional creative production in Denmark, was triggered by a series of challenging events at the beginning of the 19th century. Despite these adversities, they catalyzed a cultural renaissance that led to flourishing arts, literature, and sciences[1][2].

Key events that triggered the start of the Danish Golden Age include:

1. Copenhagen Fires (1794-1795): Large fires destroyed significant parts of Copenhagen, including Christiansborg Palace, necessitating rebuilding efforts[1].

2. Battle of Copenhagen (1801): The British Navy attacked the Danish fleet, marking Denmark's involvement in the Napoleonic Wars[1][2].

3. British Bombardment of Copenhagen (1807): The British bombarded Copenhagen, destroying large portions of the city[1][2][5].

4. State Bankruptcy (1813): Denmark-Norway declared bankruptcy due to the inability to support war costs[1][2].

5. Loss of Norway (1814): Norway was ceded to Sweden at the Treaty of Kiel, reducing Denmark's territory[1][2].

These events, while devastating, led to several developments that fostered the Golden Age:

1. Urban Renewal: The destruction in Copenhagen prompted architects and planners to redesign the city, creating wider streets and beautiful Neoclassical buildings[1].

2. Cultural Reassessment: The national setbacks induced a reevaluation of Danish character and purpose, spurring a new era of creativity[2].

3. Romantic Nationalism: The German philosopher Henrik Steffens introduced Romantic ideas through a series of influential lectures in Copenhagen in 1802, inspiring Danish thinkers and artists[1].

4. Artistic Freedom: The challenging circumstances encouraged artists to break from traditional subjects and explore new themes, as exemplified by Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg's advice to his students: "Paint whatever you wish"[2].

5. Intellectual Gatherings: The compact size of Copenhagen at the time (population around 100,000) facilitated frequent meetings among leading figures, fostering the exchange of ideas across arts and sciences[1].

The Danish Golden Age thus emerged as a response to adversity, with artists, writers, and thinkers seeking to redefine and celebrate Danish culture in the face of national challenges. This period of cultural flourishing, particularly strong in painting, literature, and philosophy, lasted until around 1850, with some interpretations extending it to 1864[1][2][3].
