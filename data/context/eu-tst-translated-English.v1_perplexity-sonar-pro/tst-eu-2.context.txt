Yes, the Samnites were indeed organized into four main tribes or clans. This confederation of tribes formed the core of Samnite society and political structure. The four primary Samnite tribes were:

1. Pentri: Often considered the most important or influential of the Samnite tribes[1][7][9].

2. Caudini: One of the central tribes in the Samnite confederation[1][2][3].

3. Hirpini: A significant tribe that was part of the Samnite league[1][2][3].

4. Caraceni (also spelled Carracini, Carricini, or Caraceni): The fourth major tribe in the Samnite confederation[1][3][9].

This tribal structure was fundamental to Samnite society and governance. Each tribe maintained a degree of autonomy in its internal affairs, but they would unite under a common leadership during times of war or external threat[2]. The confederation likely formed around the 5th century BC, possibly as a response to growing pressures from other powers in the region, particularly Rome[2].

It's worth noting that while these four tribes formed the core of the Samnite confederation, some sources mention additional groups that were either part of or closely associated with the Samnites. For example, the Frentani are sometimes considered to be of Samnite origin, though they are not always listed as one of the four main tribes[5][7].

The Samnite confederation was not a centralized state in the modern sense. Instead, it was a loose alliance of these tribes, united by shared cultural, linguistic, and religious ties. This structure allowed the Samnites to maintain their distinct tribal identities while also presenting a united front against external threats, particularly during their long series of conflicts with Rome known as the Samnite Wars[6].
