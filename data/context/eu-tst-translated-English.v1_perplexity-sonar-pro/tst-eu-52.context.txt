Based on the search results provided, there is no direct information about which languages Moshood Abiola spoke aside from English. However, we can infer some information about his linguistic background:

1. Moshood Abiola was born and raised in Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria[5][7]. This region is predominantly Yoruba-speaking, so it's highly likely that Abiola spoke Yoruba, which is one of the three main Nigerian languages[1].

2. Abiola was raised in the Yoruba Muslim faith[5], which further supports the likelihood that he spoke Yoruba.

3. As a prominent Nigerian businessman and politician who had broad national appeal[2], it's possible that Abiola may have had some knowledge of other major Nigerian languages like Hausa or Igbo, but this is not explicitly stated in the search results.

4. Abiola received his education in Scotland[5][7], which suggests he was fluent in English.

While we don't have specific information about Abiola's language skills, it's worth noting that his son, Jamiu Abiola, is described as a polyglot who is fluent in multiple languages including French, Portuguese, Yoruba, Hausa, Japanese, Igbo, Fulani, and Kanuri[3][4]. This might indicate that the Abiola family placed value on multilingualism, but we cannot definitively state which of these languages Moshood Abiola himself spoke.

In conclusion, while we can be fairly certain that Moshood Abiola spoke English and likely Yoruba, there is no explicit information in the provided search results about other languages he may have spoken.
