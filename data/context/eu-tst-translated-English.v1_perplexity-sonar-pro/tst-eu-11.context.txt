Lech Kaczyński served as the Mayor of Warsaw from 2002 to 2005[1][3][5]. Specifically:

He was elected as the 47th Mayor of Warsaw in November 2002 in the first direct mayoral elections for the city[3]. Kaczyński held this position from November 18, 2002 until December 22, 2005[3], when he resigned to assume the office of President of Poland after winning the presidential election[1].

During his tenure as Mayor of Warsaw, some notable accomplishments include:

1. Overseeing the 60th anniversary commemorations of the Warsaw Uprising in 2004[3].

2. Establishing the Museum of the Warsaw Uprising, which he initiated and created[3]. 

3. Creating departments to support residents in Warsaw's District Offices[3].

Kaczyński's time as Mayor of Warsaw was relatively brief but significant, as it served as a stepping stone to his eventual presidency. His leadership of Poland's capital city helped raise his national profile before he successfully ran for President in 2005[1][4].
