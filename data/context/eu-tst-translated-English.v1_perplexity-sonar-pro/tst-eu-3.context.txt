In 20th century Japan, Ninjutsu evolved from its historical roots as a covert martial art to serve several purposes:

Preservation and Revival: After World War II, there was a concerted effort to preserve and revive Ninjutsu as a cultural heritage. During the military occupation of Japan from 1945 to 1952, much information about military strategies, including Ninjutsu techniques, was either removed or destroyed by foreign occupants[1]. However, some aspects of the art were retained and valued to maintain law and order among civilians.

Law Enforcement: During the post-war occupation period, the Japanese police force was allowed to practice and refine certain martial arts, including elements of Ninjutsu. This led to a resurgence in research and collection of old teachings[1].

Martial Arts Training: In the latter half of the 20th century, Ninjutsu gained prominence as a martial art for self-defense and personal development. Dr. Masaaki Hatsumi, who emerged as a foremost authority on Ninjutsu, established the Bujinkan organization in 1972, which helped popularize Ninjutsu both in Japan and internationally[3][5].

Cultural Export: Ninjutsu became a significant cultural export from Japan, with various schools and organizations being established worldwide. For example, Stephen K. Hayes brought Ninjutsu teachings to the United States in the 1970s[5].

Modern Applications: Some practitioners began adapting Ninjutsu principles to address contemporary challenges. For instance, the AKBAN school in Israel, founded in 1986, integrated Ninjutsu with modern fitness methodologies and emotional regulation techniques[2].

Research and Scholarship: The 20th century saw increased scholarly interest in Ninjutsu, with researchers like Jinichi Kawakami studying and teaching about Koga and Iga ninjutsu traditions[5].

While Ninjutsu's practical application for espionage and warfare diminished in modern Japan, its principles and techniques were adapted for personal development, self-defense, and cultural preservation throughout the 20th century.
