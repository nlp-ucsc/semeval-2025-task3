The Leftovers has 3 seasons in total[1][2][4]. The show premiered on HBO on June 29, 2014, and concluded its run on June 4, 2017[1]. Here's a breakdown of the seasons:

1. Season 1: Consisted of 10 episodes and aired from June 29 to September 7, 2014[1].

2. Season 2: Also had 10 episodes and ran from October 4 to December 6, 2015[1].

3. Season 3: The final season was slightly shorter with 8 episodes, airing from April 16 to June 4, 2017[1][4].

The series was created by Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta, based on Perrotta's novel of the same name. It explores the lives of people in a world where 2% of the global population mysteriously vanished. The show received critical acclaim, particularly for its ambitious storytelling and outstanding performances, with the quality reportedly improving with each season[3][4].

Despite its critical success, The Leftovers maintained a relatively modest viewership during its original run. However, it has since gained recognition as one of HBO's best recent mystery dramas[3].
