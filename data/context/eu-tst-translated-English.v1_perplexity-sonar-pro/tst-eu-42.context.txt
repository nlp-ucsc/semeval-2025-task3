El Mercurio de Valparaíso was founded on September 12, 1827 by three typographers: Thomas G. Wells, Ignacio Silva Medina, and Pedro Félix Vicuña[3][4]. 

This newspaper holds several notable distinctions:

1. It is the oldest continuously circulating periodical published under the same name in the Spanish language[4].

2. It is considered the oldest newspaper in Chile that is still being published[3].

3. It is one of the oldest newspapers in the Western Hemisphere[7].

The newspaper was initially published in Valparaíso, Chile, and has gone through several name changes over the years:

- Mercurio de Valparaiso (1827-1830)
- Mercurio (1830-1832)
- Mercurio de Valparaiso (1832-1842)
- Mercurio (1843-onwards)[5]

Despite these name variations, it has maintained continuous publication since its founding in 1827. The newspaper has played a significant role in Chilean journalism and has survived various challenges, including a fire set by demonstrators at its headquarters in October 2019[7]. Despite this incident, the newspaper continued to publish both in print and online, demonstrating its resilience and importance in Chilean media.
