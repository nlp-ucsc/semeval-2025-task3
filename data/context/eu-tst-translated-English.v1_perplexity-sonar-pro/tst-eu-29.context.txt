Ángel Di María was born on February 14, 1988, in Rosario, Argentina[1][2][4]. He is currently 36 years old as of 2025. Di María grew up in a working-class family in Perdriel, a neighborhood in Rosario, and was the youngest of three children born to his parents, Miguel and Diana[4][5]. From a very young age, Di María showed an unusual level of activity, which led a doctor to recommend that he be signed up for football at just three years old[5]. This early introduction to the sport would set the stage for his future career as a professional footballer.
