The modern pentathlon consists of five events that athletes must complete:

1. Fencing: Athletes compete in épée fencing, with a ranking round where each athlete faces every other athlete in one-minute, one-touch bouts, followed by a bonus round with single-elimination bouts lasting 45 seconds[2][5].

2. Swimming: Competitors participate in a 200m freestyle swimming event[2][4].

3. Riding (Equestrian): Athletes complete a show jumping course on an unfamiliar horse, which they are given only 20 minutes to get acquainted with before the competition[2][5].

4. Shooting: This event is combined with running in the final discipline. Athletes use laser pistols to shoot at five targets from a distance of 10 meters[2][4].

5. Running: Also part of the combined event, athletes run a total distance of 3200 meters, alternating between running and shooting[4][5].

These five events are designed to test a wide range of athletic skills, including endurance, speed, precision, and adaptability. The modern pentathlon is unique in that it combines such diverse disciplines into a single competition, aiming to crown the most "complete" athlete[2]. The events are typically completed within a compressed timeframe, with all five disciplines contested within two hours for the semifinals and finals in the current Olympic format[5].
