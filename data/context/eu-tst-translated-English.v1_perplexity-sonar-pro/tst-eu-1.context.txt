There are approximately 130-144 known species of Pentastomida (tongue worms)[1][2]. 

Specifically:

- About 130 species of pentastomids are known according to the Wikipedia article[1].

- The Sociedad Entomol√≥gica Aragonesa publication states there are 144 Recent (living) species and 8 fossil species of Pentastomida known worldwide[2].

- The Britannica entry mentions "about 100 species"[4], though this appears to be a more conservative estimate compared to the other sources.

The vast majority of pentastomid species are obligate parasites that live in the respiratory tracts of vertebrates, primarily reptiles[1]. They have a degenerate anatomy adapted to their parasitic lifestyle. Adult tongue worms range in size from about 1 to 14 cm in length[1][4].

While pentastomids are found globally, they are more common in subtropical and tropical regions[3]. Some geographical hotspots for potential hosts include equatorial Africa, Australia, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia[3].

It's worth noting that our understanding of pentastomid diversity may still be incomplete, as new species continue to be discovered and described. The relatively low number of known species, despite their global distribution, suggests that there may be more species yet to be identified.
