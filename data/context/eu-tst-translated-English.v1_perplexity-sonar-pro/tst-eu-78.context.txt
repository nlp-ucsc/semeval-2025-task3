Laurance Spelman Rockefeller's father was John D. Rockefeller Jr.[1][4] John D. Rockefeller Jr. was a prominent American financier and philanthropist, and the only son of John D. Rockefeller Sr., the founder of Standard Oil Company[2]. 

Laurance was born on May 26, 1910, in New York City, as the fourth child and third son of John D. Rockefeller Jr. and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller[1][8]. He was one of six siblings, including Abby, John III, Nelson, Winthrop, and David[1].

John D. Rockefeller Jr. played a significant role in shaping his children's values and interests. He was known for his philanthropic efforts, particularly in conservation and park-building. His enthusiasm for these causes greatly influenced Laurance, who went on to become a leading conservationist and philanthropist in his own right[10].

The Rockefeller family, under John D. Rockefeller Jr.'s leadership, made substantial contributions to the establishment and preservation of several national parks, including Great Smoky Mountains, Shenandoah, Grand Teton, Acadia, and Redwood National Parks[10]. This family legacy of conservation and philanthropy was carried forward by Laurance throughout his life.
