Kingstown, the capital of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, was under British rule for 196 years before gaining independence[5]. The modern capital of Kingstown was founded by French settlers shortly after 1722, but it subsequently came under British control. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, including Kingstown, remained a British colony for nearly two centuries until it achieved independence in the 20th century.

It's important to note that this period of British rule refers specifically to Kingstown and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The duration of British rule varied for different Caribbean territories. For instance:

1. Jamaica was under British control for over 300 years, from 1655 until its independence in 1962[6][7].

2. North Kingstown in Rhode Island, which is a different location, has a distinct history related to British colonial rule in North America[2].

The length of British rule in various Caribbean and North American colonies depended on when they were acquired by Britain and when they gained independence. The transition from colonial rule to independence was a significant process for many of these territories in the 20th century, with some retaining ties to the British monarchy even after becoming independent nations.
