Police Academy is an American comedy film[1][2]. It falls specifically into the subgenre of slapstick comedy, relying heavily on physical humor and outrageous situations for its comedic effect[2].

The film, released in 1984, was directed by Hugh Wilson in his directorial debut and distributed by Warner Bros[1]. It's known for its lighthearted approach to police training, following a group of misfit recruits as they attempt to become police officers despite their eccentricities and lack of qualifications[1].

Police Academy's humor is characterized by:

1. Slapstick elements
2. Lowbrow comedy
3. Sexual innuendo

The movie's success led to it becoming a franchise, spawning six sequels and two television spin-offs[2]. While the films were not critically acclaimed, they were commercially successful, with the franchise as a whole grossing $391 million worldwide[2].

The humor and style of Police Academy have been compared to the British "Carry On" series, as both feature recurring ensemble casts, rely on lowbrow humor, and make frequent use of sexual innuendo[2].
