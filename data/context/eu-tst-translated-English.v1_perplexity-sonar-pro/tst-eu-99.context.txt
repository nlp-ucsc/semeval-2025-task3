Formentera is located in the south. Specifically, it is the most southerly island of the Pityusic Islands group, which is part of the Balearic Islands in Spain[1]. Formentera is situated about 6 kilometers (approximately 4 miles) south of Ibiza in the Mediterranean Sea[1][2].

To provide more context:

1. Geographical position: Formentera is the smallest and southernmost inhabited island of the Balearic archipelago[1].

2. Proximity to Ibiza: It's often referred to as Ibiza's "discreet little sister" due to its close proximity, being just a 30-minute boat ride away from the more famous party island[3].

3. Size and dimensions: Formentera is a small island, measuring about 19 kilometers (12 miles) in length[1][2].

4. Coordinates: The island is located at approximately 38°42′N 1°27′E[1].

5. Regional context: Formentera belongs to the Balearic Islands autonomous community of Spain, along with Mallorca, Menorca, and Ibiza[1].

This southern location contributes to Formentera's appeal as a quieter, more laid-back alternative to its northern neighbors, particularly Ibiza, while still offering stunning Mediterranean landscapes and beaches[4].
