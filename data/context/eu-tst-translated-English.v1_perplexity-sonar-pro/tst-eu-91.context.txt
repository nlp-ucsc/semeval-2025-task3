The SMS Emden was primarily used as a light cruiser for commerce raiding and naval warfare, particularly during World War I. Here are the key aspects of its use:

1. Commerce Raiding: The Emden gained fame for its highly successful commerce raiding activities in the Indian Ocean during the early months of World War I[1][2]. It captured or sank over 20 enemy merchant vessels, disrupting Allied shipping in the region[1][6].

2. Naval Engagements: The Emden participated in several naval battles, most notably the Battle of Penang on October 28, 1914, where it sank the Russian cruiser Zhemchug and the French destroyer Mousquet[2][6].

3. East Asia Squadron: Before its independent raiding mission, the Emden was part of the German East Asia Squadron based in Tsingtao (Qingdao), China[1][6].

4. Surprise Attacks: The ship conducted surprise attacks on enemy ports and facilities, including the destruction of oil tanks in Madras, India[1].

5. Training and Diplomatic Missions: In peacetime, the Emden (and later ships bearing the same name) was used for training naval cadets and conducted goodwill visits to various ports, serving as a diplomatic vessel for Germany[3][9].

6. Technological Advancements: Later ships named Emden were used to test new naval technologies, such as all-welded construction and diesel propulsion systems[9].

The Emden's exploits during World War I made it one of the most famous German naval vessels of the era, known for its effectiveness in disrupting enemy shipping and its adherence to the rules of naval warfare, which earned it respect even among its adversaries[1][6][8].
