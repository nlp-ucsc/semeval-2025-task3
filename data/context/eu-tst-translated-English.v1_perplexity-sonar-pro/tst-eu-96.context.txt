The original name of the HJK football team was Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi – Helsingfors Fotbollsklubb. The club was founded under this name in 1907 by Fredrik Wathén[1]. 

Some key points about the club's early history and name:

- The founding meeting was held at a bowling alley in Kaisaniemi Park in May 1907[1].

- The name "Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi" is Finnish for "Helsinki's Football Club"[1].

- Initially, the club used both the Finnish name (Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi) and the Swedish name (Helsingfors Fotbollsklubb)[1].

- In late 1908, after a heated debate, the club switched to using only the Finnish language name. This resulted in many Swedish-speaking members leaving for other clubs, though some chose to stay[1].

- Today, the club is commonly known by the abbreviation HJK or as HJK Helsinki in English contexts[1][4].

The club has maintained its Finnish name "Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi" throughout its history, reflecting its origins and identity as Helsinki's premier football club.
