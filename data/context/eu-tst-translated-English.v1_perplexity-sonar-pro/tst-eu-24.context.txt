The headquarters of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) is located in Geneva, Switzerland[2][4][8]. Specifically, UNCTAD's main offices are situated in the Palais des Nations complex, which was originally constructed for the League of Nations between 1929 and 1938[6].

The exact address of UNCTAD's headquarters is:

Palais des Nations
8-14, Avenue de la Paix
1211 Geneva 10
Switzerland[1][7]

UNCTAD is part of the United Nations Secretariat and has been headquartered in Geneva since its establishment in 1964[8]. While its main offices are in Geneva, UNCTAD also maintains additional offices in New York, United States of America, and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia[2][4]. These additional locations help UNCTAD to coordinate its activities on a global scale and maintain close ties with other UN bodies and member states.

Geneva serves as a hub for many international organizations, and UNCTAD's presence there allows it to collaborate closely with other UN agencies and international bodies that are also based in the city. This strategic location facilitates UNCTAD's mission to promote trade, investment, and development in developing countries through analysis, consensus-building, and technical assistance[4][8].
