The Istrian Peninsula is divided among three countries: Croatia, Slovenia, and Italy[1][2][4][5].

Croatia holds the largest portion of Istria, comprising about 90% of the peninsula's total area[2][5]. This part of Istria forms the Istria County, which is the westernmost county of Croatia[9]. Some of the important towns in Croatian Istria include Pula, Poreƒç, Rovinj, Pazin, and Labin[5].

Slovenia possesses the northwestern part of Istria, known as Slovenian Istria. This area includes the coastal municipalities of Piran, Izola, and Koper, as well as the Karstic municipality of Hrpelje-Kozina[5].

Italy has the smallest share of Istria, consisting of a tiny portion at the northernmost tip of the peninsula. This area includes the communes of Muggia and San Dorligo della Valle[5].

The division of Istria among these three countries is a result of its complex historical and political past. Throughout history, Istria has been under the control of various powers, including the Roman Empire, Venice, Austria-Hungary, Italy, and Yugoslavia[1][3]. The current borders were established after World War II and the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991[4][6].
