The first type of economy created by humans was the traditional economy based on subsistence farming, hunting, and gathering. This economic system emerged during the Neolithic period, around 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, with the development of agriculture and the domestication of animals[1][3].

Key characteristics of this early traditional economy include:

1. Subsistence-based: People primarily produced goods for their own consumption and immediate needs, rather than for trade or profit[1][3].

2. Small-scale production: Economic activities were centered around family or tribal units, with limited specialization[3].

3. Barter system: Exchange of goods and services occurred through direct trading, without the use of money[3].

4. Resource allocation based on customs: Distribution of resources and roles within the community was guided by traditions and social norms[5].

5. Limited technological advancement: Tools and techniques were relatively simple and passed down through generations[3].

This type of economy predates more complex systems like market economies or command economies. It emerged as humans transitioned from nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyles to more settled agricultural communities during the Agricultural Revolution[3].

The development of agriculture allowed for:

1. Food surpluses: This enabled some members of the community to specialize in non-food-producing activities[3].
2. Permanent settlements: As people no longer needed to follow animal migrations or seasonal plant growth[3].
3. Population growth: Increased food production supported larger communities[3].

Over time, these early traditional economies evolved and became more complex. The development of trade between communities, the invention of money, and the growth of specialized crafts and professions gradually led to the emergence of more sophisticated economic systems[1][2].

It's important to note that while traditional economies were the first to develop, some aspects of these systems still exist today in certain parts of the world, particularly in remote or indigenous communities[6].
