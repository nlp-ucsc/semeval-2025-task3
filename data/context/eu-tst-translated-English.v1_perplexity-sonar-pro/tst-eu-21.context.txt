Selena Quintanilla-Pérez was killed by Yolanda Saldívar on March 31, 1995, in Corpus Christi, Texas[1][2][3]. Saldívar, who was 34 years old at the time, shot Selena with a .38 caliber revolver at a Days Inn motel[1][3]. 

Saldívar was the president of Selena's fan club and manager of her boutiques. She had been accused of embezzling money from Selena's businesses, which led to a confrontation between them[1][2]. On the day of the murder, Selena had gone to meet Saldívar at the motel to retrieve financial records[1].

During their meeting, an argument ensued, and Saldívar shot Selena in the lower right shoulder, severing an artery[1]. Despite being critically wounded, Selena managed to run towards the motel lobby, leaving a trail of blood. She collapsed in the lobby after identifying Saldívar as her assailant[1].

Following the shooting, Saldívar engaged in a nearly 10-hour standoff with police, threatening to kill herself, before eventually surrendering[1][3]. She was subsequently arrested, tried, and convicted of first-degree murder in October 1995. Saldívar was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 30 years[2][3].

As of January 2025, Saldívar, now 64 years old, has filed for parole, which marks her first opportunity for release since her conviction[2][3]. Her parole hearing is scheduled for March 30, 2025[3]. However, it's worth noting that Saldívar remains a controversial figure, with reports suggesting she faces threats from other inmates due to her notoriety for killing the beloved Tejano music star[3].
