The Umayyad dynasty ruled the Caliphate of Córdoba from 929 to 1031[1][4]. This caliphate emerged from the earlier Umayyad Emirate of Córdoba, which was established in 756 when Abd al-Rahman I, a prince of the deposed Umayyad royal family, fled to the Iberian Peninsula and established an independent emirate[4].

The Umayyad rule in Córdoba can be divided into two main periods:

1. The Emirate of Córdoba (756-929): During this period, the Umayyad rulers used the title "emir" or "sultan" and nominally recognized the religious authority of the Abbasid Caliphs in Baghdad, despite being politically independent[4].

2. The Caliphate of Córdoba (929-1031): This period began when Abd al-Rahman III adopted the title of caliph in 929, challenging the authority of the Abbasid Caliphate and the Fatimid Caliphate[3][5].

Under Umayyad rule, Córdoba became one of the largest and most prosperous cities in Europe during the 10th century[5]. The caliphate was characterized by significant cultural and economic development, with advancements in art, architecture, science, and philosophy[3][7]. Notable achievements include the construction of the Great Mosque of Córdoba and the establishment of Córdoba as a major intellectual center with celebrated libraries and schools[3].

The Umayyad Caliphate of Córdoba reached its zenith during the reigns of Abd al-Rahman III (912-961) and his son al-Hakam II (961-976)[3]. However, the caliphate began to decline in the early 11th century due to internal conflicts and power struggles. It ultimately collapsed in 1031, fragmenting into numerous independent taifa kingdoms[4][5].
