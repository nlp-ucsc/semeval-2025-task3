2. The university was initially named University of Saugor or Saugar[1].

3. It is located in the city of Sagar in Madhya Pradesh[1].

4. Dr. Hari Singh Gour established the university using his lifetime savings of about two crore rupees, making it unique as it was founded by the generosity of a single individual[4].

The establishment of this university in 1946 makes it not only the oldest in Madhya Pradesh but also one of the oldest in India. It predates the formation of Madhya Pradesh as a state, which occurred in 1956 after India's independence. The university has played a significant role in the educational landscape of the region for over seven decades.
