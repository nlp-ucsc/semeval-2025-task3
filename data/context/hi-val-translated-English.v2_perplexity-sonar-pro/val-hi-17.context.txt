Razia Sultan passed away on October 15, 1240[1][2][4]. 

Razia Sultan's death came after a series of events that unfolded in 1240:

1. In April 1240, Razia was deposed by a group of nobles after ruling for less than four years[1].

2. She then married one of the rebels, Ikhtiyaruddin Altunia, in September 1240 and attempted to regain the throne[1][2].

3. In September-October 1240, Razia and Altunia assembled an army and marched towards Delhi to reclaim power[1].

4. On October 14, 1240, their forces were defeated in battle by the army of Razia's half-brother and successor Muizuddin Bahram[1][4].

5. Razia and Altunia were forced to retreat to Kaithal, where they were abandoned by their soldiers[1].

6. The next day, on October 15, 1240, Razia was killed by a group of Hindus near Kaithal[1][2][4].

Razia Sultan's reign lasted for approximately 3 years, 6 months, and 6 days[2]. Her death at the age of 35 marked the end of her ambitious attempt to regain power and her unique position as the first and only female Muslim ruler of Delhi[1][3]. Despite her short reign, Razia Sultan left a significant mark on Indian history as a capable and pioneering female ruler in a male-dominated era.
