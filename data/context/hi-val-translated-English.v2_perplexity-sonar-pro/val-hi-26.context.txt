The Nicomachean Ethics consists of ten sections, referred to as books[3][4]. These ten books comprise Aristotle's influential treatise on ethics and virtue, exploring topics such as:

1. The nature of happiness and the highest good
2. Moral virtue and its development through habit
3. Specific virtues like courage and temperance 
4. Justice and its various forms
5. Intellectual virtues
6. Weakness of will (akrasia)
7. Pleasure and its relation to the good life
8. Friendship and its types
9. Pleasure (continued discussion)
10. The contemplative life as the highest form of happiness

The work is believed to be based on lecture notes from Aristotle's teachings at the Lyceum[3]. Each book focuses on different aspects of ethics and human flourishing, building towards Aristotle's conception of eudaimonia (often translated as "happiness" or "well-being") as the ultimate goal of human life and action[2][7].

This structure allows Aristotle to systematically examine various dimensions of ethics, from individual character development to the role of reason and social relationships in living a good life. The ten-book format provides a comprehensive exploration of Aristotle's ethical philosophy, making the Nicomachean Ethics one of the most influential works in Western moral philosophy.
