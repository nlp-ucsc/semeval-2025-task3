The total cost of the film Jodhaa Akbar was ₹400 million (40 crores)[3]. This budget included several major expenses:

1. Set design: The film's elaborate sets were a significant part of the budget. The Karjat set alone, which included recreations of portions of Amer Fort and Agra Fort, cost approximately ₹120 million (12 crores)[5].

2. Costume design: Extensive research and high-quality materials were used for costumes. Neeta Lulla designed authentic period costumes using fabrics from Delhi, Mumbai, and Jaipur[5].

3. Jewelry: Around 300 kilograms of jewels were used in the film, created by a team of 200 craftsmen over 600 days[5].

4. Battle scenes: The film employed 250 stuntmen, 5,000 extras, and numerous animals including 80 elephants, 100 horses, and 55 camels[5].

5. Music video: The song "Azeem-O-Shaan Shahenshah" alone had a production cost of ₹25 million (2.5 crores), making it one of the most expensive Bollywood music videos at the time[5].

6. Extended shooting schedule: Filming took place over multiple schedules from November 2006 to October-November 2007, contributing to the overall cost[5].

It's worth noting that the budget increased during production. Initially estimated at ₹370 million (37 crores), it eventually reached ₹400 million (40 crores) due to the extensive costs associated with costumes and sets[5].
