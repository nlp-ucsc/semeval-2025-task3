Takara Company Limited did not officially close. Rather, it merged with another company to form a new entity. 

In March 2006, Takara merged with Tomy Company, Ltd. to form Takara Tomy[2]. This merger was the result of several factors:

1. Financial struggles: Despite the success of products like Beyblade in 1999, Takara was facing financial difficulties in the early 2000s[2].

2. Strategic decision: The merger was likely a strategic move to combine the strengths of both companies and improve their market position.

3. Branding considerations: The merged company chose to use both names - "Takara" for its international brand recognition and "Tomy" for its trusted brand of infant and preschool products in Japan[2].

After the merger:

- The official English name of the merged company became "TOMY Co. Ltd."
- In Japan, the legal company name is "K.K. Takara-Tomy" (株式会社タカラトミー)[2].

It's important to note that while Takara as an independent entity ceased to exist, its legacy and many of its product lines continued under the new Takara Tomy company. The merger allowed for the continuation and potential growth of Takara's popular toy lines and franchises, such as Transformers and Beyblade, within the structure of the new, larger company.
