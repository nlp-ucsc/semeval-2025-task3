Microsoft Neptune was never in an executive position, as it was not a person but rather a codename for an operating system project. However, I can provide details about the development timeline of Windows Neptune:

Neptune was a Microsoft Windows operating system project under development in 1999[1][5]. It was intended to be the first consumer version of Windows based on the Windows NT codebase, aimed at succeeding Windows 98 and later Windows Me[1][3].

Key points about Neptune's development:

1. Development started in 1999 as a successor to the Windows Neptune and Windows Odyssey projects[1].

2. The project was worked on throughout 1999[3].

3. In January 2000, Microsoft shelved Neptune in favor of a new project codenamed "Whistler"[1].

4. Only one alpha build of Neptune, build 5111, was released to testers under a non-disclosure agreement. This build was compiled on December 10, 1999, and distributed to developers on December 27, 1999[6].

5. The Neptune project was ultimately scrapped in January 2000 when the Neptune team merged with the team working on the Odyssey project (a business-oriented successor to Windows 2000)[3].

6. The merged teams formed a new project codenamed Whistler, which eventually evolved into Windows XP[1][3].

While Neptune itself was never released as a final product, many of its concepts and features influenced future Windows versions, particularly Windows XP, which incorporated some of Neptune's user interface designs and functionality[1][3].
