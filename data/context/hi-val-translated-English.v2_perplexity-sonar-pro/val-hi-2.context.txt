Galicia is not a single entity within one country, but rather a historical region that is currently divided between two countries in Europe:

1. Poland: The western part of historical Galicia is now part of southeastern Poland[4][5]. This area includes parts of the modern Polish regions of Lesser Poland Voivodeship, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, and Silesian Voivodeship[4].

2. Ukraine: The eastern part of historical Galicia is now part of western Ukraine[4][5]. This area primarily encompasses the modern Ukrainian oblasts (provinces) of Lviv, Ternopil, and Ivano-Frankivsk[4].

Historically, Galicia has been part of various political entities:

- It was originally part of the medieval Kingdom of Galiciaâ€“Volhynia[4].
- Later, it became part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth[4].
- In 1772, during the First Partition of Poland, it was annexed by the Habsburg Monarchy and became the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, a crownland of the Austrian Empire (later Austria-Hungary)[3][4].
- After World War I, it was incorporated into the Second Polish Republic[4][5].
- Following World War II, the region was divided between Poland and the Soviet Union, with the eastern part becoming part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic[5].

Today, the term "Galicia" is primarily used in a historical and cultural context, as it no longer describes an administrative or political region in either Poland or Ukraine[3]. In Poland, the area that was once part of Galicia is often referred to as "Malopolska" or Lesser Poland[3].
