Imran Khan played for the Pakistan national cricket team for approximately 21 years, from 1971 to 1992.

Imran Khan began his international cricket career in 1971 when he made his Test debut against England[1]. He continued playing for Pakistan until 1992, capping off his illustrious career by leading the national team to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup[1][3].

During his two-decade-long career, Imran Khan played:

- 88 Test matches
- 175 One Day Internationals (ODIs)

As captain, he led Pakistan in:

- 48 Test matches
- 139 ODIs[5]

Imran Khan's career was marked by significant achievements and improvements over time. In his last 10 years of international cricket (roughly 1982-1992), he played 51 Tests and averaged an impressive 50 with the bat and 19 with the ball[1][5]. This period saw him at the peak of his abilities as both a batsman and a bowler.

His final appearance for Pakistan came in the 1992 Cricket World Cup final against England, where he led his team to their first and, to date, only World Cup victory[1][3]. At the age of 39, Khan took the winning last wicket himself, providing a fitting end to his remarkable international cricket career[3].

After retiring from cricket, Imran Khan transitioned into politics, eventually becoming the Prime Minister of Pakistan in 2018[3][8]. His cricket career, however, remains a significant part of his legacy, with his induction into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in 2009 cementing his status as one of the greatest cricketers of all time[7].
