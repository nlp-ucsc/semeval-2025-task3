The Emin Minaret in Turpan, Xinjiang, China stands at a height of 44 meters (144 feet)[1][2][4][5]. This impressive structure is renowned for being the tallest minaret in China[4][5].

The minaret has a distinctive conical shape, with a wide base that tapers towards the top. At its base, the minaret has a diameter of 10 meters (32.8 feet), which narrows to 2.8 meters (9.2 feet) at the top[1][2][5]. This design gives the minaret its characteristic slender and elegant appearance.

Built in 1777-1778 during the Qing Dynasty, the Emin Minaret was constructed to honor Emin Khoja, a prominent Uyghur leader and general[1][4]. The structure showcases a unique blend of Islamic and Chinese architectural styles, featuring intricate brickwork patterns on its exterior[2][5].

Inside the minaret, there is a spiral staircase with 72 steps leading to the top[2][7]. However, it's worth noting that for preservation purposes, visitors are no longer allowed to climb the interior stairs[6].

The Emin Minaret stands as a testament to the rich cultural heritage of the Xinjiang region and serves as an iconic landmark in Turpan, attracting numerous visitors interested in its historical and architectural significance.
