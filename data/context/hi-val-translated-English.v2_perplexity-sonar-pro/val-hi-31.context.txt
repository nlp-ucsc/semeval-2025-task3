Syrian Christians primarily use Syriac, a dialect of Aramaic, as their liturgical and historical language[1][2]. Syriac emerged during the first century AD from a local Eastern Aramaic dialect spoken in the ancient region of Osroene, centered in the city of Edessa[1].

Syriac became a major language among Christian communities in the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Malabar Coast in India[1]. It remains the sacred language of Syriac Christianity to this day, used as the liturgical language of several denominations[1].

There are two main varieties of Syriac used by different Christian communities:

1. Western Syriac: Used mainly by the Syriac Orthodox Church, Syriac Catholic Church, Maronite Catholic Church, and several churches in India[1].

2. Eastern Syriac: Used primarily by the Assyrian Church of the East, the Ancient Church of the East, the Chaldean Catholic Church, and the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church[1].

In addition to these liturgical uses, there are also spoken dialects of Syriac:

1. Eastern dialect: Known colloquially as "Chaldean" or "Ashuri"[5].
2. Western dialect: Called "Syriac"[5].

These spoken dialects have further variations:

- "Ashuri" or "Suret": Spoken in Iran, Iraq, and parts of Turkey[5].
- "Turoyo" or "Surayt": Spoken in the Mardin region[5].

It's important to note that while Syriac remains the liturgical language, many Syrian Christians today may speak Arabic or other local languages in their daily lives. In fact, in Syria itself, Arabic is the official language, with only about 19.7% of the population speaking Aramaic (which includes Syriac)[4].

For Syrian Christians in India, known as Saint Thomas Christians, Syriac has been the liturgical language from a very early date, even though their identity and culture remained truly Indian[2]. Today, while Syriac remains important in their liturgy and heritage, most Saint Thomas Christians in Kerala speak Malayalam as their primary language[10].
