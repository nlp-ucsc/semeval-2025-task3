The term "biotechnology" was first coined by Hungarian agricultural engineer Karl Ereky in 1919[1][2][3]. Ereky introduced this term to describe the production of products from raw materials with the aid of living organisms[1][3]. 

Ereky's definition of biotechnology was relatively broad, encompassing the process of using technology to convert raw, biological material into useful products[4]. This early conceptualization laid the foundation for our modern understanding of biotechnology, though the field has since evolved to incorporate much more sophisticated tools and a vastly expanded knowledge base.

It's worth noting that while Ereky coined the term, the practices and principles that we now associate with biotechnology have roots that extend much further back in history. For instance, humans have been using biological processes for thousands of years in activities such as brewing beer, making cheese, and selectively breeding plants and animals[3].

However, the formal recognition of biotechnology as a distinct field of study and application can be traced back to Ereky's use of the term in 1919. Since then, biotechnology has grown into a multidisciplinary field that integrates natural sciences and engineering to apply biological systems and organisms for the development of various products and services[3].
