Probability is not inherently "in the middle of numbers," but it is often represented using numbers between 0 and 1. This range is chosen for several important reasons:

1. Normalized scale: The 0 to 1 scale provides a standardized way to represent probabilities[1]. A probability of 0 means an event is impossible, while a probability of 1 means an event is certain to occur. All other probabilities fall between these two extremes.

2. Intuitive interpretation: This scale allows for an intuitive understanding of likelihood. A probability closer to 0 indicates a less likely event, while a probability closer to 1 indicates a more likely event[1]. For example, a probability of 0.5 (or 50%) represents an event that is equally likely to occur or not occur, like flipping a fair coin[2].

3. Mathematical convenience: The 0 to 1 scale facilitates mathematical operations and comparisons. It ensures that probabilities can be easily added, multiplied, and compared without exceeding the bounds of the scale.

4. Percentage conversion: Probabilities can be easily converted to percentages by multiplying by 100. This allows for expressing probabilities in a format that many people find easier to understand (e.g., a 25% chance instead of 0.25)[2].

5. Compatibility with statistical theory: Many statistical concepts and formulas are built around probabilities expressed in this range. For instance, the cumulative distribution function of a probability distribution is defined to be between 0 and 1[3].

6. Representation of uncertainty: The 0 to 1 scale effectively captures the full spectrum of uncertainty, from complete impossibility to absolute certainty, with all degrees of likelihood in between.

It's important to note that while probabilities are often represented as numbers between 0 and 1, they can also be expressed as fractions or percentages. For example, the probability of rolling a 3 on a fair six-sided die can be expressed as 1/6, 0.167, or 16.7%[2]. These are all equivalent ways of representing the same probability.

In summary, probability is represented using numbers between 0 and 1 not because it is inherently "in the middle," but because this scale provides a standardized, intuitive, and mathematically convenient way to quantify and compare the likelihood of events.
