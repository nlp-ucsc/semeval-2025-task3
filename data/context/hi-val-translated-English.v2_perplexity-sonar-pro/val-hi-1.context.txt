Neal Caffrey, the main character in "White Collar," is imprisoned for bond forgery[5]. Despite being suspected of numerous other crimes, bond forgery was the only charge that authorities could definitively prove and convict him of[5].

Neal was a highly skilled con artist, forger, and thief who had managed to evade capture for years[1][5]. FBI Special Agent Peter Burke spent three years pursuing Neal in an intense game of cat and mouse before finally apprehending him[5]. During this time, Neal was involved in various criminal activities, including major international heists[5].

The circumstances of Neal's capture are noteworthy:

1. Neal let his guard down while attempting to elope with his girlfriend, Kate Moreau[5].
2. This momentary lapse in vigilance allowed Peter Burke, with his exceptional investigative skills, to finally catch up to Neal[5].

As a result of his conviction, Neal was sentenced to four years in prison[1][3]. This relatively short sentence, considering the extent of his suspected criminal activities, demonstrates Neal's ability to cover his tracks and maintain a seemingly clean record despite his extensive criminal career[5].

It's worth noting that Neal's imprisonment sets the stage for the series' premise. In the pilot episode, Neal escapes from prison with only a few months left on his sentence to search for Kate[1][3]. After being recaptured, he strikes a deal with the FBI to work as a consultant, using his criminal expertise to help catch other white-collar criminals in exchange for his release from prison[3][6].
