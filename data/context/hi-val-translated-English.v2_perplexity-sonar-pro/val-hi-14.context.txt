Bruce Sterling was born in the United States of America[1][2][3]. Specifically, he was born on April 14, 1954, in Brownsville, Texas[3]. Sterling spent his early years in Texas, though he also spent significant time in India as a child, which influenced his later interests[1].

Sterling went on to attend the University of Texas at Austin, graduating with a degree in journalism in 1976[1]. He began his writing career shortly after, publishing his first short story "Man-Made Self" that same year[3]. 

Throughout his career, Sterling has become known as a prominent science fiction author, particularly associated with the cyberpunk movement. He's written numerous novels, short stories, and non-fiction works, often exploring themes related to technology, society, and the future. Some of his notable works include "Schismatrix" (1985), "Islands in the Net" (1988), and "The Difference Engine" (1990, co-authored with William Gibson)[1][2][3].

While born and raised in the United States, Sterling has lived in various places throughout his life, including spending time in Belgrade, Serbia with his second wife, and later moving to Turin, Italy in 2007[1]. However, his roots and early formative years were firmly in Texas, USA.
