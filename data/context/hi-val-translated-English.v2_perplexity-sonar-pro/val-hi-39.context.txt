In 2016, China launched several significant satellites, but two particularly notable ones were:

1. The Quantum Experiments at Space Scale (QUESS) satellite, nicknamed "Micius"[1][4]. This was the world's first quantum communication satellite, launched on August 16, 2016, atop a Long March-2D rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. The satellite was designed to establish "hack-proof" quantum communications by transmitting uncrackable keys from space to the ground, and to provide insights into quantum entanglement.

2. The Gaofen-3 Earth observation satellite[3]. Launched in August 2016, Gaofen-3 was China's first synthetic aperture radar-imaging satellite. It was part of the Gaofen series of Earth observation satellites, which aim to provide high-resolution imagery for various applications including agricultural resources research and disaster monitoring.

Additionally, China continued to expand its BeiDou Navigation Satellite System in 2016:

3. The 23rd BeiDou navigation satellite was launched on June 12, 2016[9]. This satellite was part of China's efforts to develop its own global navigation system as an alternative to the U.S. GPS.

These launches demonstrate China's advancing capabilities in various areas of space technology, including quantum communication, Earth observation, and satellite navigation systems.
