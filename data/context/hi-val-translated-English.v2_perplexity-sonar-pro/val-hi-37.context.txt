The legend of La Llorona is famous across a wide range of countries in the Americas, particularly in Latin America and the southwestern United States. Here's a breakdown of the countries where the legend is most prominent:

1. Mexico: La Llorona is deeply rooted in Mexican popular culture and folklore[1][4]. It's one of the most traditional and well-known stories in the country, often used to warn children about wandering near bodies of water at night[3][4].

2. United States: The legend is particularly prevalent in the Southwestern United States, where it's used to scare children into good behavior and deter them from playing near dangerous water[4].

3. Guatemala: The legend is well-known here, with a specific version involving a woman named Luisa who drowned her child named Juan de la Cruz[4][9].

4. Central America: The legend is widespread throughout Central American countries, though specific versions may vary[2][4].

5. South America: The story is known in various South American countries, particularly:
   - Colombia
   - Venezuela: Here, the tale is set in the Venezuelan Llanos during the colonial period[4].
   - Ecuador: The Ecuadorian version features "La Llorona de Los Ríos" or "La Llorona de Los Andes"[4].

6. Spain: While not as prevalent as in the Americas, a version of the La Llorona story has been documented in Spain, particularly in Cádiz[7].

The legend's popularity extends across these regions, with variations in details and cultural significance. It's important to note that while the core elements of the story remain similar (a weeping woman associated with water and the loss of children), the specific details and interpretations can vary significantly from one country or region to another[1][4][7]. The widespread nature of this legend across so many countries speaks to its cultural importance and enduring appeal in Latin American and Hispanic folklore.
