The flag of Ghana consists of four colors[1][2][4]:

1. Red
2. Yellow (also referred to as gold)
3. Green
4. Black

The flag is designed as a horizontal triband with three equal stripes of red, yellow, and green from top to bottom. In the center of the yellow stripe, there is a black five-pointed star[2][4].

Each color in the Ghanaian flag carries symbolic meaning:

1. Red represents the blood shed during the struggle for independence[1][4].
2. Yellow (or gold) symbolizes the country's mineral wealth[1][4].
3. Green represents the rich forests and natural resources of Ghana[1][4].
4. The black star in the center symbolizes African emancipation and unity against colonialism[1][3].

This design was first adopted upon Ghana's independence on March 6, 1957, and was created by Theodosia Okoh, a Ghanaian artist and teacher[3][4]. The flag briefly changed between 1964 and 1966, but the original design was reinstated in February 1966 and has remained in use since then[3].
