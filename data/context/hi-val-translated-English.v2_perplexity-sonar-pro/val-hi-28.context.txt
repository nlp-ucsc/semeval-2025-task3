The first successful long-term lung transplant was performed by Dr. Joel Cooper and his team at the University of Toronto General Hospital in 1983[7][9]. The recipient was Tom Hall, a 58-year-old Canadian hardware executive with pulmonary fibrosis[9]. This transplant is considered the first truly successful lung transplant because Hall survived for 6 years after the surgery, becoming the first long-term lung transplant survivor[4].

It's important to note that there were earlier attempts at lung transplantation:

1. The first human lung transplant was performed by Dr. James Hardy at the University of Mississippi Medical Center on June 11, 1963[5][6]. However, the patient survived only 18 days after the surgery.

2. In 1971, Dr. Fritz Derom in Belgium performed a lung transplant where the recipient survived for 10.5 months, which was the longest survival time until Cooper's successful transplant in 1983[7].

The success of Cooper's 1983 transplant was largely due to two key factors:

1. The use of cyclosporine, a new immunosuppressant drug that allowed for reduced steroid doses and better healing[7][9].

2. The application of omentum (fatty tissue from the abdomen) to wrap around the bronchial anastomosis, which improved healing[9].

This breakthrough paved the way for further advancements in lung transplantation. Cooper and his team went on to perform the first successful double lung transplant in 1986 and the first successful double lung transplant for cystic fibrosis in 1988[8].
