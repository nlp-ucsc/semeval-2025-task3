Dr. William John Little is recognized as the first person to identify and study cerebral palsy in the 1830s and 1840s[1][2][3]. 

Specifically:

- Dr. Little began his work on cerebral palsy in the 1830s, giving lectures on how birth injuries can impact children[1].

- In 1843, Little delivered a series of lectures entitled "On the Nature and Treatment of the Deformities of the Human Frame" at England's Royal Orthopaedic Hospital, which was an important early contribution to understanding cerebral palsy[1].

- In 1853, Little published his research in a document titled "On the Nature and Treatment of the Deformities of the Human Frame"[5].

- In 1861, Little presented research to the Obstetrical Society of London where he provided the first definition of cerebral palsy[1][3]. He described it as a condition resulting from oxygen deprivation at birth that caused spasticity and sometimes paralysis[5].

While Little was the first to extensively study and define the condition, it's worth noting that the term "cerebral palsy" itself wasn't coined until later. Sir William Osler introduced the term "cerebral palsy" in 1887 in his book "The Cerebral Palsies of Children"[1][3].

So while evidence of cerebral palsy has been found in much earlier historical records[3][7], Dr. William John Little is credited with first identifying it as a distinct medical condition in the mid-19th century, particularly through his work in the 1830s-1860s.
