The largest empire in the history of India was the Mauryan Empire, which covered an area of approximately 5,000,000 square kilometers (1.93 million square miles) at its peak[1][3]. This vast empire was established around 322 BCE and reached its maximum extent around 250 BCE under the rule of Emperor Ashoka the Great[4].

The Mauryan Empire was founded by Chandragupta Maurya and expanded significantly during his reign and that of his successors. It encompassed most of the Indian subcontinent, stretching from modern-day Afghanistan and parts of Persia in the west to Bengal and Assam in the east, and from the Himalayas in the north to parts of present-day Tamil Nadu and Kerala in the south[2][5].

To put this size into perspective:

1. It was larger than the current Republic of India, which covers an area of 3,287,263 square kilometers[3].
2. It was about 25% larger than the Mughal Empire at its peak, which was the second-largest Indian empire, covering approximately 4,000,000 square kilometers[3].
3. The Mauryan Empire's territory was so vast that it included regions of present-day India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and parts of Iran and Bangladesh[5].

The Mauryan Empire's extensive size allowed for significant cultural, economic, and political influence across the region. Under Emperor Ashoka, the empire embraced and spread Buddhism, built extensive road networks, and implemented a sophisticated administrative system[4][5]. Despite its eventual decline, the Mauryan Empire left a lasting legacy on Indian civilization and set a benchmark for imperial grandeur in the subcontinent's history.
