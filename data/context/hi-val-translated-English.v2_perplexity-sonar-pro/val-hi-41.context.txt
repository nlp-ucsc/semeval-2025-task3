The second part of "The Age of Reason" by Thomas Paine was first published in 1795. Specifically:

Part II was first published in a pirated edition by H.D. Symonds in London in October 1795[1]. This was an unauthorized edition based on a faulty transcript of Paine's manuscript that the French printer sold to Symonds without Paine's knowledge[2].

The first authorized edition of Part II in English was printed by Paine himself in Paris in September 1795. Paine had engaged Paris printer J.B. Louvet to print 15,000 copies of this edition for distribution in America[2]. However, these copies did not arrive in America until April 1796, after unauthorized reprints had already been circulating[2].

In 1796, Daniel Isaac Eaton published an edition in London that contained both Parts I and II together[1][5]. This 1796 Eaton edition was one of the first to make both parts widely available together.

So in summary:
- First pirated edition: October 1795 (London)
- First authorized edition: September 1795 (Paris)
- First edition combining Parts I and II: 1796 (London)

The publication of Part II came about two years after Part I, which had been initially published in 1794[1][4]. Paine wrote Part II while recovering from illness after being imprisoned in France during the Reign of Terror[2][5].
