There are typically three main stages in a normal human birth:

Stage 1: Labor
This is the longest stage and is divided into two phases:

1. Early labor: The cervix begins to dilate and efface (thin out). Contractions start becoming regular and stronger[1][2]. This phase can last 6-12 hours for first-time mothers[5].

2. Active labor: Contractions become more intense and frequent. The cervix dilates from about 6 cm to 10 cm (full dilation)[2][3]. This phase is typically shorter than early labor.

Stage 2: Pushing and Birth
This stage begins when the cervix is fully dilated (10 cm) and ends with the birth of the baby[3][5]. The mother actively pushes during contractions to help the baby move through the birth canal. This stage can last anywhere from 20 minutes to a few hours[3][5].

Stage 3: Delivery of the Placenta
This final stage starts immediately after the baby's birth and ends with the delivery of the placenta (afterbirth)[1][3]. It typically lasts between 5 to 30 minutes, but should not exceed 60 minutes[2][4].

Some sources mention a fourth stage, which refers to the first few hours after birth when the mother's body begins to recover and bonding with the baby occurs[6]. However, this is not universally recognized as a distinct stage of labor.

It's important to note that while these stages are typical, every birth is unique and the duration and experience of each stage can vary significantly from person to person[7].
