Johann Sebastian Bach died at the age of 65[1][2][5]. He was born on March 31, 1685, and passed away on July 28, 1750[5][7].

Bach's health began to decline in his later years. At around age 57, he started experiencing various health problems, with his eyesight being the most serious issue[1]. His vision had been poor from a young age and was further weakened by extensive studying, sometimes even throughout the night[1].

In 1749, when Bach was 64 years old, his eyesight deteriorated significantly[2][5]. Despite his failing vision, he continued to work and even traveled to perform[7]. In an attempt to address his vision problems, Bach underwent eye surgery in March or April of 1750, performed by a British eye surgeon named John Taylor[1][2]. Unfortunately, this surgery was unsuccessful and led to complications[5].

Following the failed eye operation, Bach's health worsened rapidly. He suffered from a combination of ailments in his final months:

1. Blindness resulting from the unsuccessful eye surgery[1][5]
2. A stroke[2][5]
3. A high fever[3]

On the evening of July 28, 1750, just before 9 o'clock, Johann Sebastian Bach passed away[3]. He died in Leipzig, Germany, where he had spent the last 27 years of his life working as the Thomaskantor (cantor at St. Thomas Church)[2][5].

Despite his declining health in his final years, Bach continued to compose and work on music until shortly before his death. He was working on his last choral fantasia, "Before The Throne O Lord I Stand," and a fugue featuring the B-A-C-H musical theme in his final days[3].
