Article 326 of the Indian Constitution defines adult suffrage for elections to the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and State Legislative Assemblies[1][2][3]. This article establishes the principle of universal adult franchise, which means that every adult citizen has the right to vote in elections, regardless of their background[1][4].

Key points about Article 326:

1. It states that elections to the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies shall be based on adult suffrage[1][3].

2. It defines eligible voters as Indian citizens who are at least 18 years of age[1][2][5]. Originally, the minimum voting age was 21 years, but it was lowered to 18 years by the 61st Constitutional Amendment Act in 1988[1][5].

3. The article specifies that a person can be disqualified from voting on grounds of non-residence, unsoundness of mind, crime, or corrupt or illegal practices[1][3].

4. It ensures that every adult citizen, regardless of their caste, creed, race, gender, or ethnicity, has the right to vote[1].

The inclusion of universal adult suffrage in the Indian Constitution was a significant step towards establishing a truly democratic system. It allows for broad participation in the electoral process, ensuring that the government reflects the will of the people and represents diverse interests within society[7].
