The name Iravati is associated with the divine elephant Airavata, who is considered the son of the goddess Iravati in Hindu mythology[1][3].

Specifically:

1. Iravati (also spelled Iravati) is a figure in Hindu mythology. She is described as a daughter of Kadru or Bhadramada and Kashyapa in the Ramayana[1].

2. Airavata, the divine elephant who serves as the mount (vahana) of the god Indra, is said to be the son of Iravati[3].

3. Airavata is characterized as a magnificent white elephant with four tusks and seven trunks. He is known as the "king of elephants" and plays an important role in Hindu cosmology[3].

4. In some traditions, Airavata is listed as the third son of Iravati[3].

5. Interestingly, Iravati is also associated with a sacred river. The name Iravati was one of the ancient names for the river Ravi in modern-day Punjab during the Vedic period[1][4].

This connection between the goddess Iravati, her son Airavata, and the sacred river highlights the intricate web of relationships in Hindu mythology, where divine figures are often linked to natural phenomena and geographical features.
