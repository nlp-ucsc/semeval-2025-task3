3. 2013-14
4. 2014-15
5. 2015-16
6. 2019-20

Notably, Sevilla achieved a remarkable feat by winning the competition three consecutive times from 2014 to 2016, becoming the first and only club to accomplish this[3]. Their most recent triumph was in the 2022-23 season when they defeated Roma in the final[4].

Sevilla's dominance in this competition is unparalleled. They have a perfect record in Europa League finals, winning all seven of their appearances in the final match[3]. This impressive record has earned them the nickname "The Specialists" in the context of the Europa League[3].
