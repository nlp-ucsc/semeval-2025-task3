According to the Gregorian calendar, which is the most widely used calendar internationally, the current year is 2025[1][2]. Specifically, today's date is Friday, January 24, 2025[1].

However, different cultures and religions use various other calendars, resulting in different year counts:

1. Chinese Calendar: The year 2025 corresponds to the Year of the Snake in the Chinese zodiac[1].

2. Hebrew Calendar: The year is 5785[1][2].

3. Islamic (Hijri) Calendar: The year is 1446 AH (Anno Hegirae)[1][2].

4. Buddhist Calendar: In Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries, the year is 2568 BE (Buddhist Era)[1].

5. Holocene Calendar: The year is 12025 HE (Human Era)[1].

6. Byzantine Calendar: The year is 7533 AM (Anno Mundi)[1][2].

7. Ethiopian Calendar: The year is approximately 2017 or 2018 (the Ethiopian calendar is about 7-8 years behind the Gregorian)[3].

8. Julian Calendar: While no longer widely used, the Julian calendar date would be about 13 days behind the Gregorian, placing it around January 11, 2025[1][2].

It's important to note that these different calendars often have varying start dates for their new years, so the exact correspondence can shift slightly depending on the specific date within the Gregorian year 2025.
