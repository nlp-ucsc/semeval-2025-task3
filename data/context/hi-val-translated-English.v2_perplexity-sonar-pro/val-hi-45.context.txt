Arborophila birds, also known as hill partridges, are found exclusively in Asia[1][2]. These partridges inhabit various regions across eastern and southern Asia, including:

1. East Asia: Countries like China (including Tibet) and Taiwan[2].

2. South Asia: India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh[1][2].

3. Southeast Asia: Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Indonesia (including Sumatra, Java, and Borneo), and the Philippines[1][2].

Arborophila species are typically found in forested habitats, particularly in hilly or mountainous areas. They prefer subtropical or tropical moist forests, both in lowland and montane regions[1][3]. Some specific habitat preferences include:

- Evergreen forests on slopes and plateaus[1]
- Areas with dense undergrowth[1]
- Hilly regions with streams[1]
- Bamboo-dominated forests[1]

It's worth noting that while Arborophila birds are found across a wide range of Asian countries, many species have relatively small, localized ranges. This limited distribution makes some species vulnerable to habitat loss and hunting pressures[2].
