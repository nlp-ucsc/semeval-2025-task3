The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties came into effect on 27 January 1980[1][2]. This international agreement, which regulates treaties among sovereign states, was adopted and opened for signature on 23 May 1969 in Vienna, Austria. However, it took over a decade for the convention to gather the necessary ratifications to enter into force.

The convention required ratification by 35 states to become effective, as specified in its conditions[1]. Once this threshold was reached, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties became operational on 27 January 1980, establishing comprehensive guidelines, rules, and procedures for how treaties are drafted, defined, amended, and interpreted between sovereign states[1].

It's worth noting that while the convention came into effect on this date, its adoption and ratification process spanned several years:

1. Adopted and opened for signature: 23 May 1969
2. Entered into force: 27 January 1980
3. Ratifications: As of January 2018, 116 sovereign states had ratified the convention[1]

Even though some countries, like the United States, have not ratified the convention, many non-ratifying parties recognize parts of the VCLT as a restatement of customary international law[1]. This widespread recognition has made the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties a cornerstone in international treaty law and a key reference for resolving disputes about treaty interpretation.
