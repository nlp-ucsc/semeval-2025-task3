Johnny Cash died on September 12, 2003, at the age of 71. The official cause of death was complications from diabetes[1][3]. Specifically, he died of respiratory failure brought on by complications from diabetes at Baptist Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee[4][5].

While diabetes was the primary cause, Cash had been battling several health issues in his later years:

1. He was diagnosed with autonomic neuropathy associated with diabetes in the late 1990s, which forced him to curtail his touring[5].

2. In 1998, he was hospitalized with severe pneumonia that damaged his lungs[5].

3. He had undergone double bypass heart surgery in 1988[5].

4. Cash suffered from various physical ailments over the years, including eye surgery, broken ribs, and a damaged kneecap in the early 1980s[4].

It's worth noting that Cash's health declined rapidly in the months leading up to his death. He had been hospitalized several times and had to cancel shows due to illness[3]. Additionally, Cash's wife, June Carter Cash, had passed away just four months earlier, on May 15, 2003. Some fans and family members speculated that Cash's death was partially due to a "broken heart" following the loss of his wife[1].

Despite his declining health, Cash continued to work on music until shortly before his death. He recorded 60 songs in the last four months of his life, with his final recordings made on August 21, 2003, less than a month before he passed away[5].
