The Soviet Union launched the Mir space station[1][2]. Specifically:

The first module of the Mir space station, called the Mir base block or core module, was launched by the Soviet Union on February 19, 1986[1]. This core module provided living quarters, life support systems, command and control capabilities, and communications systems for the space station[1].

The Mir space station was part of the Soviet Union's crewed spaceflight program, aimed at maintaining a long-term research outpost in space[2]. It was launched and initially operated by the Soviet Union before the state's dissolution in 1991[6]. After that, Russia continued to operate the station.

Over its 15-year lifetime, the Soviets (and later Russians) added five additional research modules to expand Mir's capabilities and habitable volume[1]. The station hosted 125 cosmonauts and astronauts from 12 countries during its 13 years of human occupancy, demonstrating international cooperation in space exploration even as geopolitical changes were occurring on Earth[1][3].
