The walls surrounding the Kremlin in Moscow are made of red bricks[1][2][3]. These iconic red brick walls were built in the late 15th century, specifically from 1485 to 1495, under the direction of Grand Prince Ivan III (also known as Ivan the Great)[2][4].

Some key details about the Kremlin's red brick walls:

1. Historical evolution: The current red brick walls replaced earlier iterations. The first walls were wooden, built in 1156. Later versions were made of oak and white limestone before the red brick construction[2][3].

2. Italian influence: Ivan III invited Italian architects to design and build the new fortress. Red brick was a material more common in northern Italy and was previously unseen in Moscow at that time[6].

3. Dimensions: The walls form an irregular triangle with an outer perimeter of 2,235 meters (7,333 ft). Their height varies from 5 to 19 meters (16 to 62 ft), and their thickness ranges from 3.5 to 6.5 meters (11 to 21 ft)[3].

4. Towers: The walls feature 20 towers, with the highest being the Troitskaya Tower at 80 meters (260 ft)[4].

5. Historical whitewashing: Interestingly, despite being made of red brick, the Kremlin walls were whitewashed at various points in history. In the late 1600s, Tsar Fyodor Alekseevich ordered the red brick to be whitewashed with limestone, returning it to a gleaming white appearance. However, this whitewash was eventually allowed to wear off, a process completed by the 1900s[2].

6. Current appearance: Today, the Kremlin maintains its distinctive red brick appearance, which has become an iconic symbol of Moscow and Russia[1][5].

The red brick construction of the Kremlin walls represents a significant architectural and historical landmark, blending Italian Renaissance influences with Russian traditions and serving as a testament to Moscow's rich history and cultural heritage.
