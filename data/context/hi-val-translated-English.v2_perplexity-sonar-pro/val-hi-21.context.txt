- The stadium has 5,876 club seats[1][6].

- There are 92 luxury suites, ranging from 800 to 2,700 square feet in size[1].

- Some sources list slightly different capacities:

It's worth noting that Gillette Stadium underwent significant renovations completed for the 2023 NFL season, including the addition of the Gillette Stadium Lighthouse, new videoboards, and other amenities[1]. While these improvements enhanced the fan experience, they did not significantly alter the overall seating capacity for football games.
