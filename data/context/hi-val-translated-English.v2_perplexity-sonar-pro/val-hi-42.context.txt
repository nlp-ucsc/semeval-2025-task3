The People's Republic of China (Communists) captured the city of Chengdu in December 1949 during the Chinese Civil War[1]. Specifically, Communist forces took control of Chengdu on December 27, 1949[2].

This capture was significant for several reasons:

1. Last Kuomintang stronghold: Chengdu was the last major city on the Chinese mainland to be held by the Kuomintang (Nationalists)[2]. 

2. Strategic importance: At the time, Chengdu was serving as the national capital of the Republic of China (Nationalists) and was also the provincial capital of Sichuan[1].

3. End of an era: The fall of Chengdu effectively marked the end of major Nationalist control on the mainland. President Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo had been directing the defense of the city from the Chengdu Central Military Academy until shortly before its capture[2].

4. Peaceful transition: Interestingly, the People's Liberation Army took the city without any resistance. This was due to a negotiated deal between the Communist forces and the commander of the Kuomintang Army guarding the city[2].

5. Nationalist retreat: On December 10, 1949, just over two weeks before Chengdu fell, the remnants of the Nationalist Chinese government evacuated to Taiwan[2].

The capture of Chengdu was part of the final stage (1948-1949) of the Chinese Civil War, during which the Communist Party of China (CCP) launched a series of decisive offensives, capturing key cities and regions across China[3]. This event was one of the final steps in the CCP's establishment of control over most of mainland China, leading to the formation of the People's Republic of China.
