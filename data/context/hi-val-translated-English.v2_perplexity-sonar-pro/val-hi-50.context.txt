Jamnagar was founded by Jam Rawal in 1540 A.D. as the capital of the Princely State of Nawanagar[1][2][3]. Jam Rawal was a Jadeja Rajput ruler who established the city on the banks of two rivers, Rangmati and Nagmati[1][2].

The founding of Jamnagar is steeped in legend:

1. Jam Rawal had fled from Kutch after avenging his father's murder[1][2].

2. During a hunting trip in the area of present-day Jamnagar, Jam Rawal was impressed by a hare that turned on his hunting dogs[1][2][3].

3. This incident led him to believe that if the land could produce such brave hares, the men born there would be even more courageous[1][2][3].

4. Consequently, he decided to make this place his capital[1][2][3].

On the 7th day of the bright half of the month of Shrawan, VS 1596 (August 1540 AD), Jam Rawal laid the foundation of his new capital[1][2]. He initially named it Nawanagar, meaning "new town"[1][2]. Over time, the name evolved to Jamnagar, which translates to "town of the Jams"[1][2][3].

It's worth noting that while most sources agree on the 1540 A.D. founding date, one source mentions that Jam Rawalji built Jamnagar around 1519 A.D.[10]. However, the majority of reliable sources consistently cite 1540 A.D. as the founding year.
