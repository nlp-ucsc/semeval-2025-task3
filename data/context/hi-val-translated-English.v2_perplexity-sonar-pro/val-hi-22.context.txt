Legal action was taken against Daler Mehndi in connection with a human trafficking case from 2003. The key details of the case are:

Daler Mehndi and his brother Shamsher were accused of illegally sending people abroad under the guise of being members of Mehndi's musical troupes[1][4]. Specifically:

1. They were charged with cheating people of large sums of money by falsely promising to take them to America[1].

2. The brothers allegedly took "passage money" from people, promising to help them migrate to countries like the US and Canada illegally[4][7].

3. It was alleged that during trips to the US in 1998 and 1999, the Mehndi brothers "dropped off" about 10 people illegally[4]. 

4. One complainant, Bakshish Singh, alleged that Mehndi took ₹12 lakh from him to send him to Canada but failed to do so[7].

5. Over 30 complaints were filed against the brothers, accusing them of fraud related to illegal immigration[6].

6. The total amount allegedly cheated from victims amounted to approximately ₹1.93 crores[6].

In March 2018, Mehndi was convicted by a Patiala court and sentenced to two years in prison for his role in this human trafficking case[1][4]. The conviction was under Sections 420 (cheating) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code[7]. Although Mehndi has appealed the verdict, the case has gone through several legal twists and turns since then, including periods of imprisonment and bail[5][8].
