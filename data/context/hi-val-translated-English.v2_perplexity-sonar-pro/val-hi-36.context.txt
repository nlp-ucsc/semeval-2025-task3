Vivek Ranadivé is the owner, chairman, and CEO of the Sacramento Kings[1][2]. He is an Indian-American entrepreneur who acquired the team in 2013[3]. Here are some key details about Ranadivé's ownership of the Kings:

1. Purchase of the team: Ranadivé led a group that purchased the Kings from the Maloof family on May 31, 2013, for $534 million, which was an NBA record at the time[3].

2. Background: Before buying the Kings, Ranadivé was a minority owner of the Golden State Warriors, becoming the first person of Indian descent to co-own an NBA franchise[4].

3. Business ventures: Aside from owning the Kings, Ranadivé is involved in several other business ventures. He is the founder and managing general partner of Bow Capital, chairman and co-CEO of BowX Acquisition Corp, and has been CEO of companies like DataSynapse, LogLogic, and Tibbr[1].

4. Achievements as owner: Under Ranadivé's ownership, the Kings moved to a new arena, the Golden 1 Center, in downtown Sacramento in 2016[3]. In 2023, the team ended a 17-year playoff drought, making it to the postseason for the first time since 2006[3].

5. Challenges: Ranadivé faced criticism during the Kings' struggles, as the team went through multiple losing seasons and was often viewed negatively within NBA circles[3].
