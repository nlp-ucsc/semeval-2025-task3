Television decoders, also known as set-top boxes (STBs), use a variety of processors designed to handle the decoding and rendering of video and audio signals. The type of processor used depends on the specific requirements of the decoder, such as the resolution, compression format, and additional features like interactive services or streaming capabilities. Here are some of the common types of processors found in television decoders:

1. **Digital Signal Processors (DSPs):** These processors are specialized for handling digital signal processing tasks, such as decoding audio and video streams. They are often used in conjunction with other processors to offload complex mathematical operations.

2. **Microprocessors:** General-purpose microprocessors are used to handle the control logic, user interface, and other software-based tasks within the decoder. These can range from simple embedded processors to more powerful CPUs depending on the application.

3. **Graphics Processing Units (GPUs):** Some higher-end decoders, especially those that support high-definition (HD) or ultra-high-definition (UHD) content, may incorporate GPUs to accelerate video rendering and graphics processing.

4. **Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs):** Many decoders employ ASICs that are specifically designed for decoding and processing video and audio codecs. These chips are optimized for performance and power efficiency, making them ideal for decoding compressed content like MPEG, H.264, or H.265.

5. **System-on-Chip (SoC):** Modern decoders often use SoCs that integrate multiple components, such as the CPU, GPU, DSP, and memory, onto a single chip. This integration helps reduce power consumption and improves performance, making it suitable for devices like smart TVs and streaming devices.

6. **FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array):** Some decoders may use FPGAs for their flexibility. FPGAs can be programmed to perform specific tasks, such as decoding certain video formats or handling encryption, making them useful in scenarios where hardware customization is needed.

7. **ARM Processors:** Many modern set-top boxes use ARM-based processors due to their high performance, low power consumption, and wide support for various operating systems and software ecosystems.

In summary, television decoders typically use a combination of specialized processors like DSPs, GPUs, and ASICs, along with general-purpose processors, to handle the decoding, rendering, and control functions required for delivering digital television content. The choice of processor architecture depends on the decoder's intended use, the type of content it supports, and the need for efficiency and performance.
