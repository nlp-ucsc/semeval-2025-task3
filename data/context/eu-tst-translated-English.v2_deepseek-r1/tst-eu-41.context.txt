As of my last update in July 2024, the coach of Real Madrid Castilla, which is the reserve team of Real Madrid, is **Raúl González**. Raúl, a legendary former player of Real Madrid, has been managing the team since 2021. For the most up-to-date information, I recommend checking the latest news from Real Madrid's official sources or reliable sports news outlets.
