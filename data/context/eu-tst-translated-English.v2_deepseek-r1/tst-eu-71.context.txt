Count Carlo Gozzi was an Italian playwright and a prominent figure in the literary movement known as **Neo-Classicism**. He is particularly famous for defending the genre of **commedia dell'arte** during the 18th century, a form of improvisational theatre that originated in Italy in the 16th century. Gozzi believed in preserving the traditional elements of commedia dell'arte, which included stock characters, masks, and a mix of humor and drama. He wrote several plays in this style, often incorporating fantastical and fairy-tale elements, and his works were influential in keeping the tradition alive during a time when other literary movements, such as Romanticism, were gaining prominence.
