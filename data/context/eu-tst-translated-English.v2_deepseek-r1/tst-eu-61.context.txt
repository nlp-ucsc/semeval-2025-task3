Mileto, which is a frazione (hamlet) of the comune (municipality) of Messina in Sicily, Italy, doesn't itself have the status of a comune. Therefore, it doesn't border with other municipalities. However, the comune of Messina, to which Mileto belongs, borders with the municipalities of Fiumefreddo di Sicilia, Piedimonte Etneo, and Villafranca Tirrena.
