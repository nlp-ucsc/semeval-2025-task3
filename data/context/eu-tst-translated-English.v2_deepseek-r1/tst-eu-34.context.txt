The first type of economy created by humans was likely a **subsistence economy**, which was based on hunting, gathering, and small-scale agriculture. In these early societies, people focused on producing just enough food and resources to sustain themselves and their communities, with little to no surplus for trade.

**Key characteristics of a subsistence economy:**
- **Hunting and gathering**: Early humans relied on wild animals and plants for food.
- **Simple tools**: They used basic tools made from stone, wood, and bone.
- **Nomadic lifestyle**: Many groups were nomadic, moving to find food sources.
- **Small, tight-knit communities**: Societies were small, and resources were shared within the group.
- **Limited specialization**: There was little division of labor beyond basic roles like hunting and gathering.

Over time, as humans developed more advanced tools and agriculture, subsistence economies gradually gave way to more complex systems, such as **barter economies**, where goods and services were exchanged directly without money. Eventually, this evolved into the diverse range of economies we see today, from traditional to modern capitalist systems.
