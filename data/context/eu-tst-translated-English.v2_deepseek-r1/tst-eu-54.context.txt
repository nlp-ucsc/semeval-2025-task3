The pentathlon typically consists of five different events. The specific events can vary depending on whether it's a modern pentathlon or an ancient pentathlon. Here are the events for both:

### Modern Pentathlon (Men and Women):
1. **Fencing**: Competitors fence each other using the épée, with the goal of scoring as many points as possible.
2. **Swimming**: A 200-meter freestyle swim where the fastest time earns the most points.
3. **Equestrian (Show Jumping)**: Riders navigate a challenging obstacle course on horseback, with penalties for knocked-down fences or refusals.
4. **Combined Running and Shooting**: A 3,200-meter race where athletes must shoot targets using a laser pistol at specified points along the course.
5. **Cross-Country Running**: A race over varying terrain that concludes the event.

### Ancient Pentathlon (Historical):
1. **Javelin Throw**: Participants would throw a javelin as far as possible.
2. **Discus Throw**: Aiming to throw the discus the furthest distance.
3. **Stade (Sprint)**: A short sprint, typically around 180-200 meters.
4. **Wrestling**: A match where the goal was to throw the opponent to the ground.
5. **Long Jump**: Jumping as far as possible, often using weights to aid the leap.

Each of these events in both modern and ancient pentathlons tests a variety of skills and physical abilities, making the pentathlon a comprehensive and challenging competition.
