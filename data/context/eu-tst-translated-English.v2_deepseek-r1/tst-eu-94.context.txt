Bahram I was a Sassanian king who ruled from 271 to 274 AD. His reign was notable for his efforts to consolidate Sassanian authority and deal with external threats, such as the Romans. He also had a challenging relationship with the Zoroastrian priesthood, which opposed his tolerance of Manichaeism, a religious movement founded by Mani. This conflict led to increased persecution of Manichaeans during and after his reign. Bahram I's reign was relatively short and saw significant internal and external challenges.
