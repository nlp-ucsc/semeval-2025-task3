Protons and neutrons together form the **nucleus** of an atom. The nucleus is located at the center of the atom and consists of these two types of particles. Protons have a positive charge, while neutrons are neutral. The number of protons in the nucleus determines the element of an atom, and the number of neutrons can vary, leading to different isotopes of the same element. The combination of protons and neutrons in the nucleus gives the atom its mass number, which is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons.
