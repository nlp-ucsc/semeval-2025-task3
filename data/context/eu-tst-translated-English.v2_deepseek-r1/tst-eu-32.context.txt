The three main ways to obtain nationality are:

1. **Jus Sanguinis (Right of Blood):** This is based on the principle that nationality is acquired through the nationality of one's parents. In this case, you automatically become a citizen if your parents are citizens of a country, regardless of where you are born.

2. **Jus Soli (Right of the Soil):** This is based on the principle that nationality is acquired by being born within the territory of a country. In this system, anyone born in the country is automatically a citizen.

3. **Naturalization:** This is the process by which a person who is not a citizen by birth becomes a citizen through meeting certain legal requirements such as residency, language proficiency, and knowledge of the country's customs, laws, and history.
