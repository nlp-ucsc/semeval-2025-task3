The Second Council of Nicaea, held in 787 CE, was primarily convened to address the Iconoclastic Controversy, which was a theological dispute within the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) regarding the use of religious images, or icons. The main goal of the council was to restore the veneration of icons, which had been banned by previous emperors who supported iconoclasm (the destruction of images).

The council affirmed that icons were a legitimate and valuable part of Christian worship, arguing that the veneration of icons was not idolatrous but rather a way to honor the saints and Christ they represented. This decision was significant for the Eastern Orthodox Church, as it reaffirmed the use of religious imagery in worship and established the importance of tradition and the authority of earlier church councils.
