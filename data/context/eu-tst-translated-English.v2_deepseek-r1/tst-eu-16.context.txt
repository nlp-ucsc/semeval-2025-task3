The Catholic Church celebrates Holy Thursday, also known as Maundy Thursday, as part of the Paschal Triduum, which marks the final days before Easter. Here are some key aspects of what is commemorated on this day:

1. **The Last Supper**: Holy Thursday primarily commemorates the Last Supper, where Jesus shared a final meal with His disciples before His arrest. This event is described in the New Testament and is significant because it instituted the Eucharist, a central sacrament in Catholicism.

2. **Institution of the Eucharist**: During the Last Supper, Jesus took bread and wine and turned them into His Body and Blood, establishing the sacrament of the Eucharist. Catholics believe that the consecrated bread and wine are the real presence of Christ.

3. **Washing of the Feet**: Jesus also washed the feet of His disciples during the Last Supper, demonstrating an act of humility and service. Some Catholic churches reenact this ritual, known as the Mandatum, during Holy Thursday Mass to symbolize servant leadership and humility.

4. **Thebetrayal and Arrest of Jesus**: Holy Thursday also marks the beginning of the events leading to Jesus' Passion. It is the night when Jesus was betrayed by Judas, leading to His arrest and subsequent crucifixion.

5. **Liturgical Practices**: The Mass on Holy Thursday is unique. It includes the reading of the Passion of Jesus, the Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, and a special rite where the Eucharist is transferred to a place of repose, symbolizing Jesus' time in the Garden of Gethsemane before His arrest.

6. **The Paschal Triduum**: Holy Thursday is the first day of the Paschal Triduum, a period that continues through Good Friday and Holy Saturday, culminating in Easter Sunday. These days are dedicated to the commemoration of Jesus' Passion, Death, and Resurrection.

Overall, Holy Thursday is a solemn and reflective day in the Catholic Church, focusing on the institution of the Eucharist and the events that led to Jesus' sacrifice, emphasizing themes of love, service, and devotion.
