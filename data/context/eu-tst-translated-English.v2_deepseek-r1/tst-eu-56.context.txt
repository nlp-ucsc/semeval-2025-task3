Publius Quinctilius Varus is most famously known for his role in the Battle of Teutoburg Forest, where he led the Roman legions XVII, XVIII, and XIX. The battle took place in 9 AD, in what is now modern-day Germany. During this battle, Varus and his legions were ambushed and annihilated by a coalition of Germanic tribes led by Arminius, a chieftain of the Cheruscan tribe who had previously served as an ally to the Romans.

Varus, realizing the gravity of the situation and seeing his forces being decimated, took his own life to avoid capture by the Germanic warriors. The exact method of his suicide is not universally agreed upon, but it is traditionally believed that he fell on his sword. This act was in line with Roman military tradition, where a commander might choose to take their own life rather than face the disgrace of defeat and potential captivity.

The Battle of Teutoburg Forest was a significant defeat for the Roman Empire, leading Emperor Augustus to abandon further campaigns east of the Rhine River, marking the end of Roman efforts to conquer and hold Germany as a province. The loss was so devastating that it is said Augustus would often beat his head against a wall, exclaiming "Quintilius Varus, give me back my legions!"
