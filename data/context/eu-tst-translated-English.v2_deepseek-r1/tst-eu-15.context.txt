If the office of the President of the Spanish government (commonly referred to as the Prime Minister or "Presidente del Gobierno" in Spanish) becomes vacant, the process to replace them is governed by the Spanish Constitution of 1978. Here's a step-by-step explanation of what happens:

1. **Vacancy Scenarios**: The vacancy could occur due to the President's resignation, incapacitation, death, loss of parliamentary confidence, or a vote of no confidence.

2. **Provisional Leadership**: Immediately upon the vacancy, the incumbent President continues in office temporarily, as Acting President ("Presidente en funciones"), until a new President is sworn in. This ensures continuity of government.

3. **Nomination by the King**: The King of Spain, in his role as Head of State, is responsible for nominating a candidate for the presidency. This nomination is not arbitrary; it is typically based on consultations with the political parties represented in the Congress of Deputies (the lower house of the Spanish Parliament).

4. **Investiture Debate**: The nominated candidate must appear before the Congress of Deputies to present their program and seek the confidence of the chamber. This is known as the "Debate de Investidura."

5. **Vote of Confidence**: After the debate, a vote is held. The candidate needs an absolute majority (i.e., more than half of the total votes in the Congress). If the candidate fails to secure this majority, a second vote is held 48 hours later, where only a simple majority (more than half of those voting, excluding abstentions) is required.

6. **Repeat Process if Necessary**: If the candidate fails both votes, the King must nominate another candidate, and the process repeats. If no candidate secures confidence within two months, the King dissolves the Cortes Generales (the Spanish Parliament) and calls new general elections.

7. **Swearing In**: Once a candidate secures the confidence of the Congress, they are sworn in before the King, marking the official start of their term as President.

This process ensures that the presidency is filled in accordance with constitutional procedures, maintaining political stability and continuity in governance.
