The name "Garajonay" comes from the Guanche language, which was spoken by the indigenous inhabitants of the Canary Islands before the Spanish conquest. The Guanche people had their own distinct culture and language, which is now extinct but has left behind a rich legacy in the place names of the islands.

"Garajonay" can be broken down into two parts: "gar" and "jonay." In Guanche, "gar" means "crag" or "rock," and "jonay" is a personal name. So, combining these, "Garajonay" likely refers to a rocky or mountainous place associated with someone named Jonay. This aligns with the park's landscape, which is characterized by rugged terrain, dense forests, and ancient volcanic formations.

The park, located on the island of La Gomera, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is known for its stunning natural beauty, including its lush laurisilva forests and unique biodiversity. The name "Garajonay" not only reflects the park's geological features but also serves as a nod to the island's pre-colonial heritage and the Guanche people who once inhabited it.
