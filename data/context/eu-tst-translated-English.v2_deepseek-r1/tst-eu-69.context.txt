The Sweet Chestnut tree (*Castanea sativa*) does not produce showy flowers like many other flowering plants. Instead, it produces long, yellowish-green catkins, which are a type of flower cluster. These catkins are typically 10-20 cm in length and appear in late spring or early summer. The catkins contain both male and female flowers. The male flowers are at the top of the catkin, and the female flowers are near the base. After pollination, the female flowers develop into the spiny husks that contain the chestnuts. While the flowers aren't particularly showy, they play a crucial role in the reproductive process of the tree.
