The Common Martin, also known as the Sand Martin, typically breeds in the spring and summer months. The exact timing of their breeding season can vary depending on the location. In general, they begin nesting in late March or early April in the Northern Hemisphere, with the peak breeding period usually occurring between May and July.

During this time, they dig nesting burrows, often in sandy cliffs or banks, and the female lays a clutch of eggs. The eggs hatch after about 14 to 16 days, and both parents take turns incubating them and caring for the young. The fledging period, when the young birds leave the nest, generally occurs around June or July.

It's important to note that the specific breeding times can be influenced by local climate conditions and weather patterns, so the exact start and end of the breeding season may differ slightly from year to year and from one region to another.
