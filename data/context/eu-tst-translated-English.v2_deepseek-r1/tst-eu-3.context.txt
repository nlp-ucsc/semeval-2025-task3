Ninjutsu, the traditional martial art of the ninja, was initially developed in Japan during the feudal period (roughly 14th to 17th centuries) as a set of espionage, sabotage, and guerrilla warfare techniques. However, by the 20th century, ninjutsu had evolved significantly, and its role and perception in Japanese society changed in several ways. Here's how ninjutsu was used and perceived in Japan during the 20th century:

1. **Modern Martial Art and Sport**: In the 20th century, ninjutsu evolved into a modern martial art. It was no longer used for its original purposes of espionage and sabotage but was practiced as a physical discipline. Various schools and organizations emerged, teaching ninjutsu as a form of self-defense, physical fitness, and spiritual development. The art gained popularity as part of Japan's rich martial arts culture, alongside Karate, Judo, and Aikido.

2. **Cultural Revival and Nationalism**: During the early 20th century, there was a resurgence of interest in traditional Japanese martial arts, including ninjutsu, as part of a broader cultural and nationalistic movement. This was partly driven by the Meiji Restoration and later by the Japanese Empire's efforts to promote traditional values and martial spirit. Ninjutsu was romanticized as a symbol of Japanese cunning and resilience, and it became a subject of interest in literature, film, and popular culture.

3. **Military and Police Training**: During World War II, elements of ninjutsu were incorporated into military training, particularly in unconventional warfare and espionage units. After the war, some martial arts schools continued to teach ninjutsu techniques to law enforcement and security personnel for practical applications in modern combat and self-defense scenarios.

4. **Tourism and Cultural Promotion**: In the latter half of the 20th century, ninjutsu became a tourist attraction and a part of Japan's cultural exports. Many dojo (training halls) began offering classes to foreigners, and ninja-themed attractions, such as the Ninja Akasaka in Tokyo and the Iga Ryu Ninja Museum in Iga, Mie Prefecture, became popular. This helped to promote ninjutsu as an integral part of Japan's historical identity and cultural heritage.

5. **Pop Culture and Media**: The 20th century saw a tremendous surge in the popularity of ninjutsu through various forms of media, such as films, television series, books, and manga (Japanese comics). Characters like the "ninja" became iconic figures in Japanese pop culture, further cementing the art's place in the national consciousness. The portrayal of ninjas in media often blended historical accuracy with creative imagination, leading to a romanticized and sometimes mythical perception of ninjutsu.

6. **Spiritual and Philosophical Practices**: Beyond the physical aspects, ninjutsu also came to be seen as a vehicle for personal growth and spiritual development. Many modern practitioners emphasize the mental and philosophical dimensions of the art, including disciplines like meditation, strategy, and the cultivation of awareness and adaptability. This holistic approach to martial arts is deeply rooted in traditional Japanese thought and continues to be an important aspect of ninjutsu practice in the 20th century.

In summary, while ninjutsu's practical applications in espionage and warfare diminished by the 20th century, the art found new life as a modern martial art, a cultural symbol, and a popular cultural phenomenon. Its evolution reflects both the continuities of Japanese tradition and the dynamic adaptation of these traditions to modern contexts.
