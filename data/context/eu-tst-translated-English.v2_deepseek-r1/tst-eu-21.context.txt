She was killed by Yolanda Saldivar, who had been her fan club president and the manager of her clothing stores.

Yolanda Saldivar was later convicted of the crime and sentenced to life in prison. This incident shocked Selena's fans and the music industry, as Selena was a rising star with a promising career ahead of her.
