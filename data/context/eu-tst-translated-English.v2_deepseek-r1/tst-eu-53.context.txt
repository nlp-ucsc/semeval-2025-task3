The word "progeria" originates from the Greek language. Specifically, it is derived from the Greek word "γέρος" (géros), which means "old man." This term is used to describe a rare genetic disorder that causes accelerated aging in children, leading to physical characteristics typically associated with elderly individuals at a very young age. Progeria is a condition where the body ages prematurely, affecting both appearance and internal organs, and is often referred to as Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) in honor of the physicians who first described it.
