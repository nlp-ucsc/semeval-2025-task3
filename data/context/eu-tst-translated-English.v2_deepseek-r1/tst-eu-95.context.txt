The word "collage" originates from the French language. It is derived from the verb "coller," which means "to glue." This term was initially used in the early 20th century to describe a new art technique where artists would glue different materials, such as paper, fabric, or found objects, onto a surface to create a new composition. Over time, the term has evolved and is now widely used in various contexts, including art, education, and even digital design, to refer to the act of combining disparate elements into a unified whole.
