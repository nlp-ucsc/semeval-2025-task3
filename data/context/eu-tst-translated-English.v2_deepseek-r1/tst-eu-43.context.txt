Yes, Fuligo septica, also known as dog vomit slime mold, is occasionally used in gastronomy despite its unappealing appearance and name. It has a mild, earthy flavor and a soft, custard-like texture. Some chefs use it in dishes to add a unique touch, though it is not widely commonly used. Always ensure it's safely identified and properly prepared if considering consumption.
