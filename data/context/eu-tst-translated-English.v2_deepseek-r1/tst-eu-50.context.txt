John Waters is renowned for his early career characterized by low-budget, avant-garde, and often transgressive films referred to as "trash cinema." His initial films, such as "Mondo Trasho" (1969) and "Multiple Maniacs" (1970), explored themes of underground culture, featuring elements of shock value, surrealism, and dark humor. These works defied mainstream conventions and established him as a cult figure. His breakthrough film, "Pink Flamingos" (1972), became iconic for its bold and irreverent style.
