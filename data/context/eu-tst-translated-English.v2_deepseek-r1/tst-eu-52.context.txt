Chief Moshood Abiola was a Nigerian businessman, publisher, and politician. He was known to speak several languages, although I'm not certain of the exact number. While English was his primary language, he likely spoke Yoruba, his native language, and possibly Hausa, given Nigeria's diverse linguistic landscape. However, specific information about the other languages he spoke is not readily available.
