Cladoniaceae fungi, commonly known as reindeer lichens, are a family of lichens that are typically found in cold, temperate, and arctic regions. They tend to proliferate more in cold climates rather than warm climates. These lichens are highly adapted to survive in harsh, cold environments with limited vegetation. They are often found in Arctic tundras, alpine regions, and other areas where the climate is cool and moist. The cold, nutrient-poor conditions are ideal for their growth, and they play a crucial role in the ecosystems of these regions, serving as a primary food source for many animals, such as reindeer. In contrast, warm climates are less conducive to their growth due to higher temperatures and drier conditions, which are not favorable for their survival and proliferation.
