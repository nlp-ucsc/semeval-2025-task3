The Alpine belt, or the Alpine orogen, is a mountain range system that stretches across Southern Europe, including the Alps, the Carpathians, the Apennines, and other related mountain ranges. It was primarily formed during the Alpine orogeny, which occurred from the late Mesozoic to the Cenozoic era, roughly between 65 million and 5 million years ago. The formation of the Alpine belt is a result of the collision between the African and Eurasian tectonic plates.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the formation process:

1. **Continental Rifting and Opening of the Tethys Sea**: During the Mesozoic era, the supercontinent of Pangaea began to break apart. This rifting led to the opening of the Tethys Sea, which separated the Eurasian plate to the north and the African plate to the south. The Tethys Sea was a large body of water that existed between these two plates.

2. **Subduction of the Tethys Sea**: Over time, the African plate began to move northwards towards the Eurasian plate. As a result, the oceanic crust of the Tethys Sea was subjected to increasing compression and subduction (where one tectonic plate is forced beneath another). The heavier oceanic crust of the Tethys Sea was pushed beneath the lighter continental crust of Eurasia.

3. **Collision of the African and Eurasian Plates**: By the late Cretaceous period, around 65 million years ago, the African and Eurasian plates began to collide. This collision led to the closure of the Tethys Sea and the subsequent formation of mountain ranges as the edges of the plates were pushed upwards. The collision was not head-on but more of an oblique collision, which resulted in a complex system of mountain ranges rather than a single linear range.

4. **Formation of the Alps and Related Ranges**: The collision caused the Earth's crust to thicken and deform, leading to the formation of the Alps and other mountain ranges in the Alpine belt. The rocks were folded, faulted, and uplifted to form the high peaks and mountainous terrain we see today. The process involved both thrust faulting, where rocks were pushed over each other, and folding, which created the characteristic mountain folds.

5. **Continued Uplift and Erosion**: Even after the initial collision, the African and Eurasian plates continued to move towards each other, causing ongoing uplift of the Alpine belt. This tectonic activity, along with erosion from glaciers and rivers, shaped the final topography of the region.

6. **Neogene and Quaternary Volcanic Activity**: In some regions within the Alpine belt, such as the Pannonian Basin and parts of the Apennines, volcanic activity occurred during the Neogene and Quaternary periods. This volcanism was related to post-collisional processes, such as the formation of back-arc basins and mantle upwellings.

Overall, the formation of the Alpine belt was a complex process involving continental rifting, sea closure, plate collision, and subsequent deformation of the Earth's crust. It is a prime example of orogenesis, the process by which mountain ranges are formed.
