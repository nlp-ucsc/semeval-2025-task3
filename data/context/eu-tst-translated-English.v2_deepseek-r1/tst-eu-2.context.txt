The Samnites were a group of Indo-European-speaking peoples who inhabited central and southern Italy before the rise of the Romans. They were organized into four major tribes, each with its own territory and identity. The four tribes that made up the Samnites were:

1. **Pentri**: They were the most prominent and central tribe of the Samnites, living primarily in the region of modern-day Molise. The Pentri were known for their strong military traditions and often played a leading role in Samnite affairs.

2. **Caraceni**: Inhabiting the northern parts of Samnium, the Caraceni were another important tribe. Their territory was located near the modern province of Isernia and parts of L'Aquila.

3. **Caudini**: The Caudini occupied the southern regions of Samnium, particularly around the modern area of Avellino. They were known for their involvement in the famous battle with the Romans in 321 BCE, known as the Battle of the Caudine Forks.

4. **Hirpini**: The Hirpini were located in the southernmost part of Samnium, near the modern province of Benevento. Their name is thought to be derived from the Oscan word for "wolf," possibly reflecting a totemic or symbolic association with the animal.

These four Samnite tribes were known for their fierce resistance to Roman expansion, particularly during the Samnite Wars (343â€“290 BCE). Their military and political alliances played a significant role in shaping the history of the Italian peninsula during the Republican period of Rome.
