Tuvalu, located in the Pacific Ocean, about halfway between Hawaii and Australia, has a tropical marine climate. The country is composed of nine islands and is one of the least elevated countries in the world, making it highly vulnerable to climate change. Here are some key features of Tuvalu's climate:

1. **Temperate**: The climate is generally warm and humid year-round, with average temperatures ranging from 25°C (77°F) to 30°C (86°F).

2. **Seasonal Variations**: Tuvalu experiences a wet season, from November to March, and a dry season, from April to October. The wet season is characterized by heavy rainfall and higher humidity.

3. **Rainfall**: Annual rainfall is significant, averaging around 3,500 mm (138 in), with the majority of it falling during the wet season. The rain is often associated with tropical storms and cyclones, which can bring strong winds and rough seas.

4. **Cyclones**: Tuvalu is occasionally affected by tropical cyclones during the wet season. These storms can cause severe damage to infrastructure and agriculture.

5. **Sea Levels**: As a low-lying island nation, Tuvalu is particularly susceptible to rising sea levels. Coastal erosion, saltwater intrusion into freshwater supplies, and more frequent flooding during high tides are significant concerns.

6. **Humidity**: The relative humidity is high throughout the year, often exceeding 80%.

7. **Wind Patterns**: The islands experience trade winds from the southeast during the dry season, which help to moderate temperatures and bring relief from the heat.

8. **El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)**: Climate variability, such as El Niño and La Niña events, can influence rainfall patterns, leading to droughts or prolonged wet periods.

9. **Impact of Climate Change**: Tuvalu is considered one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. Rising sea levels threaten the very existence of the islands, and changes in rainfall patterns and increased frequency of extreme weather events pose significant challenges to agriculture, water supply, and livelihoods.

Overall, Tuvalu's climate is warm and humid, with distinct wet and dry seasons, and is increasingly influenced by the impacts of global climate change.
