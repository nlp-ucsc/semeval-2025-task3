The Emden was a German light cruiser that served during World War I. Its main use was as a commerce raider. Here's why:

1. **Commerce Raiding**: The Emden's primary role was to attack and destroy Allied merchant ships, disrupting supply lines and causing economic hardship.

2. **Speed and Agility**: It was fast and maneuverable, allowing it to evade enemy ships and quickly engage or escape when necessary.

3. **Armed with Torpedo Tubes and Guns**: Equipped with guns and torpedo tubes, the Emden could effectively target both merchant vessels and military ships.

4. **Raider Tactics**: The cruiser often disguised itself by flying false flags to deceive targets before attacking, a common tactic for raiders at the time.

5. **Notable Battles**: The Emden engaged in several notable battles, including the Battle of Penang, where it sank two Allied warships. It was eventually destroyed by the Australian cruiser HMAS Sydney in November 1914.

Overall, the Emden played a significant role in disrupting Allied shipping during the early years of World War I.
