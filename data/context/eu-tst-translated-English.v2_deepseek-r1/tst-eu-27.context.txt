Denis Sassou-Nguesso, the current President of the Republic of the Congo (Congo-Brazzaville), first came to power in 1979 through a military coup. At the time, Congo-Brazzaville was experiencing political instability, and Sassou-Nguesso, who was a brigadier general in the army, seized power on February 7, 1979, overthrowing the government that had been in place since the country's independence from France in 1960.

Sassou-Nguesso's rise to power was also facilitated by the support of the then-Soviet Union, which was active in African politics during the Cold War. The Soviet Union saw Sassou-Nguesso as a favorable leader due to his ideological alignment with Marxist-Leninist principles at the time.

He established a one-party state under the Congolese Labour Party (PCT), which had a Marxist orientation. During his tenure, Sassou-Nguesso implemented a range of socialist economic policies and sought to maintain close relations with the Soviet Union and other socialist states.

However, with the end of the Cold War, Sassou-Nguesso faced increasing internal and external pressures to democratize. In the early 1990s, he introduced multiparty elections, but political instability and a civil war in the late 1990s allowed him to consolidate power again. He returned to the presidency in 1997 and has remained in power ever since.

Despite his initial Marxist alignment, Sassou-Nguesso's rule has been characterized by authoritarianism and the suppression of political opposition. He has maintained a strong grip on power through a combination of political maneuvering, control over state institutions, and strategic alliances, both domestically and internationally.
