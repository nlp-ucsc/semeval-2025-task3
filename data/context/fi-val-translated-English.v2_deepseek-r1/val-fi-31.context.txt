The Eastern Phoebe (Sayornis phoebe) is a type of flycatcher, not a crow, and it is native to eastern North America. Its range extends from Canada to Central America, and it can be found in a variety of habitats, including forests, fields, and urban areas. However, if you're referring to the "Mud Crow" specifically, it's important to note that there isn't a widely recognized bird species by that exact name. If you meant a different bird or a regional variation, please provide more context so I can give you a more accurate answer.
