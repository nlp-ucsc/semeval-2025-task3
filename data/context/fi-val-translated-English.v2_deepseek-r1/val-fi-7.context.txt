No, not all arthropods have antennae. Arthropods are a diverse group that includes insects, arachnids, crustaceans, and others. Insects and some crustaceans typically have antennae, which are used for sensing their environment. However, arachnids, such as spiders and scorpions, do not have antennae. Instead, they use other structures like pedipalps or sensory organs on their legs to interact with their surroundings. This variation highlights the different adaptations within the arthropod group.
