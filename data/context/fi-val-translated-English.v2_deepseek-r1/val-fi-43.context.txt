No, the Arts and Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI) doesn't focus solely on arts and humanities subjects. While it primarily covers these areas, it also includes some social sciences and other related disciplines. It's part of the Web of Science and indexes a broad range of journals, allowing for comprehensive citation tracking across various fields. However, its main emphasis remains on arts, humanities, and related interdisciplinary studies.
