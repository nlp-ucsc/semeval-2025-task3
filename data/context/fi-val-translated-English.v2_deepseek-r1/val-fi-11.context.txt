In the Netflix series "The Punisher," Frank Castle, also known as The Punisher, is primarily focused on uncovering the truth behind the conspiracy that led to the death of his family. Specifically, he is trying to clean up the remnants of a criminal organization involved in illegal arms dealing, drug trafficking, and other nefarious activities.

The series delves into a complex web of corruption that involves both the military and the criminal underworld. Frank's mission is not just about vengeance, but also about bringing those responsible for the death of his family and the manipulation of military personnel to justice. His actions in Hellâ€™s Kitchen are part of a larger effort to dismantle this corrupt system and expose the truth.

Throughout the series, Frank's efforts not only target the immediate criminals but also higher-ranking officials and organizations that have allowed or facilitated these illegal activities. His goal is to rid the city of the corruption that has infected it, even as he grapples with his own moral ambiguities and the consequences of his vigilantism.
