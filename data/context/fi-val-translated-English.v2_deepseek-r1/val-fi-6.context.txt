"Raivotarjonta" is a Finnish term that combines "raivo" and "tarjonta." "Raivo" translates to "rage" or "fury" in English, and "tarjonta" means "offering," "supply," or "selection." 

In context, "raivotarjonta" is often used humorously or sarcastically to describe a very limited or meager selection of something. For example, it might be used to describe a situation where there's only one or very few options available, often in a way that highlights the lack of variety or abundance. 

The term is not commonly used in formal Finnish but is more of a colloquial or slang expression.
