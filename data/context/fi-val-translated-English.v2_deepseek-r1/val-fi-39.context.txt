Since 2006, Gillette Stadium, which is the home of the New England Patriots (NFL) and the New England Revolution (MLS), has had a **FieldTurf** surface. FieldTurf is a brand of artificial turf, which is designed to mimic the look and feel of natural grass but is more durable and requires less maintenance.

However, it's worth noting that in 2014, the stadium installed a new, state-of-the-art **FieldTurf surface** specifically designed for the World Cup, following criticism from players and coaches about the quality of the previous artificial turf. The field has undergone additional upgrades over the years to improve player safety and performance.
