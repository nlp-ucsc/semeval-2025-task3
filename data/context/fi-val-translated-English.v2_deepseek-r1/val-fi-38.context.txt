Al-Khobar, a city located in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, was established as a result of several factors related to its strategic position and economic potential. Here are the key reasons:

1. **Strategic Location**: Al-Khobar is situated on the Persian Gulf coast, making it a vital port city and a significant hub for trade and commerce. Its proximity to the Gulf has historically made it an important center for fishing and maritime activities.

2. **Oil Discovery**: The discovery of oil in nearby Dammam in 1938 transformed the region. Al-Khobar benefited from its close proximity to the oil fields and became a key location for the oil industry. The establishment of oil refineries, pipelines, and related infrastructure boosted the city's growth.

3. **Economic Diversification**: As the oil industry expanded, Al-Khobar became a center for related economic activities, including petrochemical plants, manufacturing, and services. This diversification attracted investment and led to the establishment of various industries in the area.

4. **Government Support**: The Saudi government invested heavily in the development of Al-Khobar, recognizing its potential as a major economic hub. Infrastructure projects, including roads, ports, and industrial zones, were developed to support the city's growth.

5. **Population Growth**: The influx of workers and professionals connected to the oil and related industries led to significant population growth in Al-Khobar. This growth created a demand for housing, services, and amenities, further driving the city's expansion.

In summary, Al-Khobar was established and developed primarily due to its strategic location on the Persian Gulf, the discovery of oil in the region, and the subsequent economic and industrial growth driven by the oil industry, coupled with government support and infrastructure development.
