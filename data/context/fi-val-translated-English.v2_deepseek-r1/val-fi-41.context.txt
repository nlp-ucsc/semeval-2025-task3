As of the most recent data available up to July 2024, approximately 6.9% of adults in Finland suffer from type 2 diabetes. This translates to around 300,000 people. Additionally, there is a prevalence of undiagnosed cases, which could potentially increase this number. The Finnish Diabetes Association actively works on awareness and prevention to address this issue. For the most current statistics, consulting recent reports from the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) is recommended.
