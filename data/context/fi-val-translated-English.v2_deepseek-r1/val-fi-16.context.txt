No, Saint Basil's Cathedral is not part of the Moscow Kremlin. While both are iconic landmarks in Moscow, Russia, they are separate entities located in close proximity to each other. Saint Basil's Cathedral is situated on Red Square, which is outside the walls of the Kremlin. The Kremlin, a fortified complex, houses several cathedrals and palaces, but Saint Basil's is not one of them. It was built in the 16th century to commemorate a significant military victory and is one of the most recognizable symbols of Russia.
