In a case-control study, there are typically **two groups** that are examined:

1. **Cases** - These are individuals who have the disease, outcome, or condition being studied.
2. **Controls** - These are individuals who do not have the disease, outcome, or condition being studied.

The study compares these two groups to identify potential risk factors or associations between exposures and the outcome.
