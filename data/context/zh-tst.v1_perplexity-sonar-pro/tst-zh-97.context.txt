Based on the search results, here are the key test launches of the JL-2 (Julang-2) submarine-launched ballistic missile:

1. December 30, 2011: First successful underwater launch from a Type 092 submarine (also known as G-class conventional submarine used for testing)[7].

2. January 2012: A series of 6 test launches were conducted from the Type 092 submarine[7].

3. August 21, 2012: Successful launch from a Type 094 nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine[7].

4. December 22, 2013: Successful launch from the lead Type 094 submarine (hull number 409)[7].

5. January 23, 2015: Another successful launch from the lead Type 094 submarine (hull number 409)[7].

Additionally, some earlier milestones in the JL-2's development include:

- In 2003, the first land-based test launch of the JL-2 was successful[4].

- However, multiple failures occurred in subsequent tests, especially underwater launches, including issues with the missile failing to exit the launch tube and the missile body breaking[4].

- After significant design improvements, on July 20, 2011, the first successful underwater launch of a telemetry missile (used for gathering flight data) was conducted[4].

- On August 16, 2012, another successful underwater launch of a telemetry missile was carried out[4].

These successful tests in 2011-2012 marked important breakthroughs in the JL-2's development, leading to its eventual deployment on China's Type 094 nuclear submarines.
