I apologize, but I don't have enough accurate information to provide a detailed answer about which provinces border Amoncourt (阿蒙库尔). The search results don't contain specific information about the provinces bordering Amoncourt. 

However, I can provide some related information based on the search results:

1. Amoncourt (阿蒙库尔) is a commune in the Haute-Saône department in the region of Bourgogne-Franche-Comté in eastern France[7].

2. Haute-Saône is an inland department in eastern France. It borders several other departments, including Vosges, Territoire de Belfort, Doubs, Jura, Côte-d'Or, and Haute-Marne, moving clockwise from the north[9].

3. While not specifically about Amoncourt, the search results mention that some communes in France border other communes or former communes. For example, Courtémont borders Berzieux, Dommartin-sous-Hans, and Hans[6].

To get accurate information about the provinces bordering Amoncourt, we would need more specific data about its exact location and administrative boundaries within Haute-Saône. If you need precise information, I recommend consulting official French administrative maps or contacting local authorities in the Haute-Saône department.
