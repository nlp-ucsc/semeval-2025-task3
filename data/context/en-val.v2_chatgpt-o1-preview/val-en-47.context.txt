Bischofsheim was a constituent community of Mainz from 1930 to 1945. In 1930, Bischofsheim, along with the neighboring communities of Ginsheim and Gustavsburg, was incorporated into the city of Mainz. However, after World War II, the borders were redrawn due to the occupation zones established by the Allied forces. The Rhine River became the dividing line between the French and American occupation zones. Mainz fell under the French zone, while Bischofsheim was placed in the American zone. As a result, in 1945, Bischofsheim was separated from Mainz and became part of the state of Hesse, where it remains today.
