The first physician known to systematically treat patients for cerebral palsy was Dr. William John Little, a British orthopedic surgeon in the 19th century. In the 1860s, Dr. Little extensively studied children with spastic paralysis, a condition resulting from brain damage at birth, which later became known as cerebral palsy. He published detailed accounts of their symptoms and treatments, leading to the term "Little's Disease" to describe the condition. His work laid the foundation for understanding and managing cerebral palsy in the medical community.
