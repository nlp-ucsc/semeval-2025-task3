Yes, kremlins are similar to detinets. Both terms refer to fortified central complexes or citadels within Russian cities.

Detinets is an older term from the Old East Slavic language, used during the medieval period to describe the inner fortress of a town. It was the heart of the city, often housing important buildings like cathedrals, princely palaces, and administrative centers. A notable example is the Novgorod Detinets, which served as the political and religious hub of Novgorod.

On the other hand, kremlin (Russian: Кремль) became the more commonly used term from the 14th century onwards. Like detinets, a kremlin is a fortified complex that includes palaces, cathedrals, and governmental buildings. The most famous is the Moscow Kremlin, which has been the seat of Russian power for centuries and is currently the official residence of the President of Russia.

In essence, both detinets and kremlins served similar purposes as fortified centers of administration, religion, and defense. The primary difference lies in the historical period and regional usage of the terms. Over time, "kremlin" became the dominant term, but in some historical contexts, especially when referring to certain cities like Novgorod, "detinets" is still used.
