No, Windows Neptune was never officially released to the public. Windows Neptune was the codename for an unreleased version of the Microsoft Windows operating system. It was intended to be the first consumer-oriented version of Windows built on the Windows NT codebase, moving away from the older Windows 9x architecture.

Development on Neptune began in the late 1990s but was eventually merged with another project codenamed "Odyssey," which was aimed at the business market. The combined efforts of these projects led to the creation of Windows XP, released in 2001. Windows XP served both consumer and business markets and became one of Microsoft's most successful operating systems.

Therefore, Windows Neptune itself was never released as a standalone product, but its development influenced the features and architecture of Windows XP.
