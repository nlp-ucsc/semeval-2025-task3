The municipality of Delley-Portalban was created on January 1, 2005, through the merger of two former municipalities, Delley and Portalban. Both were located in the district of Broye in the canton of Fribourg, Switzerland. The merger was part of a broader initiative to streamline administrative processes and improve local governance by consolidating smaller municipalities.
