As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the order Erysiphales, commonly known as powdery mildews, contains approximately 19 genera. These genera are all part of the family Erysiphaceae, the sole family within the order. The exact number of genera can vary slightly depending on taxonomic revisions and new scientific findings, but it generally hovers around this number.

Here are some of the key genera within Erysiphales:
- Blumeria
- Erysiphe
- Golovinomyces
- Leveillula
- Microsphaera
- Phyllactinia
- Podosphaera
- Sphaerotheca
- Uncinula


These fungi are obligate parasites, primarily affecting a wide range of plants by forming characteristic powdery white patches on leaves and stems. Advances in molecular phylogenetics may lead to reclassification or the discovery of new genera, so for the most up-to-date information, consulting the latest scientific literature or a current mycological database is advisable.
