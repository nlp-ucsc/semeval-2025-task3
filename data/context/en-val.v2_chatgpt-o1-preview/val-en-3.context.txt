No, not all arthropods have antennae. Arthropods are a diverse group that includes insects, crustaceans, myriapods (centipedes and millipedes), and arachnids (spiders, scorpions, ticks, and mites). While insects, crustaceans, and myriapods typically possess antennae, arachnids do not. Instead of antennae, arachnids have specialized appendages called pedipalps and chelicerae, which serve various sensory and feeding functions.
