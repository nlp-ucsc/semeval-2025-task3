As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, HÃ¼ffelsheim, a municipality in the district of Bad Kreuznach in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, is partnered with Pove del Grappa, a town in Italy. This partnership is part of a town twinning arrangement aimed at fostering cultural exchange and mutual understanding between the two communities.
