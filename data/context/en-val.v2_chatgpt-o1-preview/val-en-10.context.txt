There are three stages of labor in childbirth:

1. First Stage (Labor Onset to Full Cervical Dilation):
 - Latent Phase: Early contractions lead to gradual cervical dilation up to about 3-4 centimeters.
 - Active Phase: Rapid cervical dilation from 4 centimeters to full dilation at 10 centimeters, with stronger, more regular contractions.
2. Second Stage (Full Dilation to Birth of the Baby):
 - This stage involves pushing as the baby moves through the birth canal and is delivered.
3. Third Stage (After Birth of the Baby):
 - Delivery of the placenta, also known as the afterbirth, occurs during this final stage.

These stages encompass the complete process of labor and delivery.

Answer: Three stages - the labor is divided into first, second, and third stages.
