Captain Morgan rum was first introduced in 1944. The brand was founded by the Seagram Company, which started producing rum under the name "Captain Morgan Rum Company" after purchasing a distillery in Jamaica. The rum was named after Sir Henry Morgan, a 17th-century Welsh privateer who became the Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica and was known for his exploits in the Caribbean.
The brand has since become one of the most recognized names in the rum industry, offering a variety of spiced and flavored rums. In 2001, Diageo, a multinational beverage company, acquired the Captain Morgan brand from Seagram.
