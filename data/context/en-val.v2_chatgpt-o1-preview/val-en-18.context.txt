Yes, a Graphics Address Remapping Table (GART) can be considered a type of Input/Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) specifically designed for graphics processing units (GPUs). The GART allows a GPU to access system memory efficiently by remapping the GPU's virtual addresses to the physical addresses in main memory. This process facilitates direct memory access (DMA) operations for graphics data.

An IOMMU is a hardware component that manages memory access for devices, translating device-specific virtual addresses to physical memory addresses. It enhances system stability and security by isolating device memory spaces and preventing unauthorized memory access. Similarly, the GART performs address translation and memory management for GPUs, enabling them to handle large textures and datasets that may not fit entirely in their dedicated video memory.

So, the GART serves as an IOMMU for graphics operations, providing address translation and memory management functionalities tailored for GPU requirements.
