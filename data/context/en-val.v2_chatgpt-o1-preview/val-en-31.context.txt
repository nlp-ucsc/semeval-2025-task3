The term "western oriole" commonly refers to the Bullock's Oriole (Icterus bullockii), a species native to western North America. Adult Bullock's Orioles typically measure about 7 to 7.5 inches (18 to 19 centimeters) in length. They have a wingspan of approximately 12 inches (30 centimeters) and weigh around 1 to 1.5 ounces (28 to 43 grams).

These medium-sized songbirds are known for their vibrant plumage: males display bright orange and black coloring, while females have a more subdued yellow and gray appearance. Bullock's Orioles inhabit open woodlands, riparian areas, and orchards, where they feed on insects, nectar, and fruit.
