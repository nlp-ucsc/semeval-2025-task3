To find out how many days remain until the end of the year from October 14th in a non-leap year, we'll calculate the remaining days in October and add the full days of November and December.

1. Remaining days in October:
 - Total days in October: 31
 - Days passed by October 14th: 14
 - Remaining days in October: 31âˆ’14=17 days
2. Total days in November and December:
 - November has 30 days
 - December has 31 days
 - Total: 30+31=61 days
3. Total remaining days until the end of the year:
 - 17 (October) + 61 (November and December) = 78 days

Answer: 78
