The previous name of Gillette Stadium was CMGI Field. When the stadium was initially constructed, it was named after CMGI Inc., an internet company that acquired the naming rights in 2000. However, due to financial difficulties during the dot-com bust, CMGI restructured, and the naming rights were eventually transferred. In 2002, the Gillette Company purchased the naming rights, and the stadium was renamed Gillette Stadium.
