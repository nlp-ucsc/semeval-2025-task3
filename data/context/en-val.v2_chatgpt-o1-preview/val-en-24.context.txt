As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, the World Chess Federation, known by its French acronym FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs), is based in Switzerland. Specifically, FIDE relocated its headquarters to Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2019. Lausanne is known for hosting several international sports organizations, including the International Olympic Committee.
