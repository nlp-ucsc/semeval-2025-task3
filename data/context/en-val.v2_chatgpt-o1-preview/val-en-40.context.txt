The Swedish Navy, known as Svenska marinen, was founded in 1522. Its establishment dates back to when King Gustav Vasa purchased ships from the Hanseatic city of LÃ¼beck on June 7, 1522. This event is considered the foundation of Sweden's naval forces and marks the beginning of the Swedish Navy's history, making it one of the oldest navies in the world.
