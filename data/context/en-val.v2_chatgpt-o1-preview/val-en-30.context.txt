Before the Civil War, the area now known as Valrico, Florida, was called Long Pond. It was primarily a region of cotton plantations and small settlements. The name "Valrico," which means "rich valley" in Spanish, was adopted later in the 1880s when new settlers arrived, spurred by the construction of the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad. The change reflected the community's growth and development during that period.
