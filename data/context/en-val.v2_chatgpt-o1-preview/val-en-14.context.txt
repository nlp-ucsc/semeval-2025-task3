The Bleeding Kansas civil confrontations occurred between 1854 and 1859. This period was marked by violent clashes between pro-slavery and anti-slavery settlers in the Kansas Territory. The conflict arose from the debate over whether Kansas would enter the Union as a free or slave state, following the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which allowed the territory's residents to decide the issue through popular sovereignty. The violence in Kansas foreshadowed the larger national conflict that would erupt during the American Civil War.
