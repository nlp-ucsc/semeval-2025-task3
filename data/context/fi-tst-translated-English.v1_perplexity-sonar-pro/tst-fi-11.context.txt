The Second Council of Nicaea was convened in 787 AD primarily to address the issue of iconoclasm and restore the use and veneration of religious images (icons) in Christian worship[1][3]. Here are the key reasons and context for this council:

1. Iconoclastic controversy: The council was called to resolve the ongoing dispute over the use of religious images, which had been suppressed in the Byzantine Empire[1].

2. Overturning previous bans: It aimed to overturn the earlier iconoclast policies implemented by:
   - Emperor Leo III (717-741), who had banned religious images[1][3]
   - Emperor Constantine V (741-775), who had officially banned icons through the Council of Hieria in 754[1][2]

3. Imperial initiative: The council was convoked by Emperor Constantine VI and his mother Empress Irene (acting as regent)[1][3].

4. Ecclesiastical support: The council was also recommended by Patriarch Paul IV of Constantinople and his successor Patriarch Tarasios[6].

5. Church unity: One of the goals was to unite the church, which had been divided over the iconoclast controversy[6].

6. Doctrinal clarification: The council sought to provide a clear doctrinal stance on the veneration of icons and distinguish it from idolatry[7].

7. Restoration of tradition: It aimed to reaffirm and restore the practice of venerating icons, which was seen as part of the apostolic tradition of the Church[6].

The council ultimately approved the veneration of icons, distinguishing between the veneration (proskynesis) given to images and the worship (latria) reserved for God alone[1][7]. This decision became a significant point of doctrine for both the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches, though it was later rejected by many Protestant reformers[7].
