The Canon EOS 70D features a 20.2 megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor[1][2][3][4]. Here are the key details about the sensor:

- Sensor type: CMOS
- Sensor size: 22.5 x 15.0 mm (APS-C)
- Effective pixels: Approximately 20.2 megapixels
- Total pixels: Approximately 20.9 megapixels
- Aspect ratio: 3:2
- Pixel size: 4.1Î¼m
- Crop factor: 1.6x

The sensor incorporates some innovative technology:

1. It features Dual Pixel CMOS AF, which allows for on-chip phase detection autofocus at every pixel location over almost two-thirds of the sensor's surface area[3]. This enables smooth and fast autofocus during live view and video recording.

2. Each pixel site contains two photodiodes sitting under a single shared microlens[3]. This design enables the phase-detection autofocus capability.

3. The sensor has a built-in low-pass filter with a fluorine coating[2][5].

4. It includes an EOS integrated cleaning system to help keep the sensor clean[2][5].

This sensor, coupled with the DIGIC 5+ image processor, allows for an ISO range of 100-12,800 (expandable to 25,600)[1][4] and enables the camera to shoot at up to 7 frames per second[3][7].
