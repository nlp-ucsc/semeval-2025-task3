Jonnali Mikaela Parmenius is better known by her stage name Noonie Bao[1][2][3]. She is a Swedish singer, songwriter, and record producer born on August 9, 1987[1][5]. Noonie Bao has gained recognition in the music industry both as a performer and as a songwriter for other artists. She has written songs for notable musicians such as Charli XCX and Avicii, contributing to hit singles like "Doing It" and "I Could Be the One"[2]. 

While she initially focused on writing for others due to some apprehension about releasing her own material, Noonie Bao has since stepped into the spotlight as an artist in her own right[2]. Her music is characterized by unique melodies and slightly off-kilter sounds, which she describes as being influenced by her love for writing songs on the black keys of the piano[2].
