Hassan Rouhani won the 2013 Iranian presidential election, securing a first-round victory with over 50% of the vote[1][3]. Here are the key details of the election outcome:

1. Results:
- Hassan Rouhani received 18,613,329 votes, which accounted for 52.49% of the total valid votes cast[1].
- Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf came in second with 6,077,292 votes (17.14%)[1].
- The other candidates received fewer votes: Saeed Jalili (11.76%), Mohsen Rezaee (10.95%), Ali Akbar Velayati (6.40%), and Mohammad Gharazi (1.26%)[1].

2. Voter turnout:
- The total number of votes cast was 36,704,156[1].
- Voter turnout was 72.71% of the 50,483,192 registered voters[1][3].

3. Election process:

- Over 66,000 polling stations were set up across Iran, with additional stations for expatriates in other countries[1].

4. Significance:
- Rouhani's victory was considered surprising, as he was seen as the most moderate candidate among those permitted to run[5].
- His win represented a desire for change among the Iranian public, despite the systematic purging of moderates and reformists from the political system in the preceding decade[5].

5. Provincial results:
- Rouhani won the majority of votes in most provinces, with a few exceptions like Chahar Mahaal and Bakhtiari and Khuzestan, where Mohsen Rezaee received more votes[1].

The election of Hassan Rouhani, considered a moderate, marked a shift in Iranian politics following the controversial 2009 election and subsequent protests. This outcome suggested a potential for changes in Iran's domestic and foreign policies, although the extent of these changes remained to be seen given the ultimate authority of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei[5][6].
