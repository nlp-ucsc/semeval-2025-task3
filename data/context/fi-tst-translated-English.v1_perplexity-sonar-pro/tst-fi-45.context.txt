Bar-tailed godwits (Limosa lapponica) are large migratory wading birds known for their exceptional long-distance flights. Here are some key details about these remarkable birds:

Physical characteristics:
- Large waders with long legs and a long, slightly upturned bill[1][2]
- Bill is bi-colored - pink at the base and black towards the tip[1]
- Breeding plumage: Males have brick-red underparts, females are duller with chestnut to cinnamon belly[2]
- Non-breeding plumage: Mottled brown above, lighter buff below[1]
- Distinctive white barred tail[1]
- Females are larger than males[2]

Habitat and distribution:
- Breed in Arctic regions of Scandinavia, northern Asia, and Alaska[1][2]
- Spend non-breeding season in coastal areas of temperate and tropical regions, including Australia and New Zealand[2]
- Inhabit estuarine mudflats, beaches, and mangroves during non-breeding periods[1]

Migration:
- Known for extremely long non-stop flights during migration[2]
- Alaska-breeding population (L. l. baueri) makes the longest non-stop flight of any bird, traveling over 11,000 km from Alaska to New Zealand[2]

Feeding habits:
- Diet consists of mollusks, worms, and aquatic insects[1]
- Use their long bills to probe into mud and shallow water for food[1]
- Often feed in groups, including non-breeding migrants and young birds[1]

Breeding:
- Nest in Arctic tundra regions[1][2]
- Nest is a shallow cup in moss, sometimes lined with vegetation[2]
- Both parents incubate the eggs and care for the young[1]

Conservation status:
- Listed as Near Threatened due to habitat loss, particularly at critical migration stopover sites[4]

Bar-tailed godwits are remarkable for their incredible migratory abilities and play important roles in the ecosystems they inhabit throughout their annual cycle.
