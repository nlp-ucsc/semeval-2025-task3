Capuchin monkeys comprise multiple species across two genera, Cebus and Sapajus. The exact number of species is somewhat debated as taxonomic classifications continue to evolve, but based on the most current information provided in the search results:

There are at least 28 recognized species of capuchin monkeys[2]. These are divided into two main groups:

1. Gracile Capuchins (Genus Cebus):
   This genus includes at least 15 species[4], such as:
   - Colombian white-faced capuchin (Cebus capucinus)
   - Panamanian white-faced capuchin (Cebus imitator)
   - Marañón white-fronted capuchin (Cebus yuracus)
   - Humboldt's white-fronted capuchin (Cebus albifrons)
   - Guianan weeper capuchin (Cebus olivaceus)
   - Ka'apor capuchin (Cebus kaapori)
   - Ecuadorian white-fronted capuchin (Cebus aequatorialis)

2. Robust Capuchins (Genus Sapajus):
   This genus includes at least 8 species[4], such as:
   - Black-capped or tufted capuchin (Sapajus apella)
   - Blond capuchin (Sapajus flavius)
   - Black-striped capuchin (Sapajus libidinosus)
   - Black capuchin (Sapajus nigritus)
   - Golden-bellied capuchin (Sapajus xanthosternos)

It's worth noting that some sources provide slightly different numbers. For example, one source mentions 5 or 6 different species of capuchin monkeys[1], while another specifically states there are 5 different species[5]. These discrepancies likely arise from ongoing taxonomic debates and recent discoveries.

The classification of capuchin monkeys is complex and subject to revision as new genetic and morphological studies are conducted. Some populations previously considered subspecies have been elevated to full species status in recent years, contributing to the higher species count in more current sources[2][4].
