The Oudalan province in Burkina Faso is home to several ethnic groups, with the largest being:

1. Fulani (also known as Peul or Fulbe): The Fulani people constitute a significant portion of Oudalan's population. They are traditionally nomadic pastoralists and make up approximately 9.4% of Burkina Faso's total population[1]. In Oudalan, they likely represent an even larger percentage due to the province's location in the Sahel region, which is known for pastoralist communities.

2. Tuareg: The Tuareg people are another major ethnic group in Oudalan. They are nomadic pastoralists who inhabit the Sahara desert region, including parts of Burkina Faso. While they make up about 2.5% of Burkina Faso's total population[1], their concentration is likely higher in Oudalan due to its geographical location.

3. Bella: Also known as Tamasheq, the Bella people are closely associated with the Tuareg and are one of the main languages spoken in the Sahel Region, which includes Oudalan[8].

4. Mossi: While the Mossi are the largest ethnic group in Burkina Faso overall, making up about 50.2% of the country's population[1], their presence in Oudalan is likely less pronounced compared to the central and southern regions of the country.

It's important to note that Oudalan, like much of Burkina Faso, is multi-ethnic. The province's population includes various other ethnic groups, though specific percentages for Oudalan are not provided in the search results. The ethnic composition of the area is influenced by its location in the Sahel region and its history of nomadic and pastoralist communities.

The population of Oudalan province was reported as 158,206 in the 2019 census[2][5]. However, it's worth noting that due to security situations, some population figures in certain areas of Burkina Faso were estimated rather than fully counted during this census[2].
