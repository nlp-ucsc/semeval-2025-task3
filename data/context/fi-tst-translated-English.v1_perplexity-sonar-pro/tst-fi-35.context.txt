The Anglo-Irish were descendants and successors of the English Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland[1][3]. They represented a sociopolitical and economic elite that dominated Irish society for approximately two centuries, from the early 18th century onwards[4]. 

Specifically, the Anglo-Irish were:

1. Descendants of English Protestant settlers who came to Ireland during various waves of colonization, particularly during the Cromwellian period in the 17th century[6].

2. Members of the Anglican Church of Ireland or, to a lesser extent, English dissenting churches like the Methodist church[6].

3. Landowners who acquired property through land confiscations from the Irish Catholic aristocracy[3].

4. The ruling class that replaced the Gaelic Irish and Old English aristocracies in Ireland during the 17th century[6].

5. A group that often identified themselves as Irish, despite their English or mixed Irish-British ancestry, and lived at a social level far above most of the native Irish population[4].

The Anglo-Irish dominated various aspects of Irish society:

1. Politics: They controlled the Irish Parliament and held significant political power[2].

2. Economy: They owned much of the farmland, where Catholic peasants worked[2]. By the early 20th century, they also owned many major indigenous businesses in Ireland, including Jacob's Biscuits, Guinness brewery, and the Bank of Ireland[6].

3. Military: Many Anglo-Irish men served as officers in the British Army[6].

4. Religion: They were prominent in the established Anglican Church of Ireland[6].

5. Culture: They significantly influenced Irish culture, producing notable figures in literature and the arts[7].

It's important to note that while the Anglo-Irish held a position of privilege and power, their status was often complex and sometimes conflicted. Some became advocates for Irish independence, while others remained staunchly loyal to Britain[2][6]. By the early 20th century, with Irish independence, the distinct Anglo-Irish community began to decline, though their cultural and historical impact remains significant[7][10].
