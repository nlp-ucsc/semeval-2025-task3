A dual-use item refers to goods, software, or technology that can be used for both civilian and military applications[1][2][3]. These items have legitimate commercial purposes but also have the potential to be utilized for military, terrorism, or weapons of mass destruction (WMD) related activities[3].

Key characteristics of dual-use items include:

1. Versatility: They have applications in both civilian and military contexts[1][2][3].

2. Regulatory control: Due to their potential for misuse, dual-use items are subject to export controls and regulations[4][8].

3. Wide range of categories: Dual-use items span various sectors, including nuclear materials, chemicals, electronics, computers, telecommunications, sensors, lasers, navigation systems, and aerospace technologies[1][5].

4. Potential for transformation: Some dual-use items can be modified or repurposed for military use even if originally intended for civilian applications[4].

Examples of dual-use items include:

- Global positioning satellites
- Certain types of missiles
- Nuclear technology
- Chemical and biological tools
- Night vision technology
- Thermal imaging equipment
- Some drone models
- Specific types of ball bearings
- Aluminum pipes with precise specifications[4]

The concept of dual-use technology has significant implications for international security, trade, and diplomacy. Governments and international organizations have established various control regimes and regulations to manage the export and transfer of dual-use items[8]. These measures aim to prevent the proliferation of weapons and technologies that could threaten global security while allowing legitimate trade and technological development[6].

It's important to note that the classification of dual-use items can be complex, as it often depends on specific technical characteristics, intended use, and potential for misuse. Companies and researchers working with potentially dual-use technologies must be aware of relevant regulations and export control requirements to ensure compliance with international and national laws[7][9].
