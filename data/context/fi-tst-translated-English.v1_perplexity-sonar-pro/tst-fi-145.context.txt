The Tataouine Governorate borders both Algeria and Libya[1]. It is located in the southern part of Tunisia and is the only governorate in the country that shares borders with both of these neighboring nations[1]. 

Some key points about Tataouine Governorate's location:

1. It is situated in the southernmost part of Tunisia[1].

2. It is the largest governorate of Tunisia by area, covering 38,889 square kilometers[1].

3. Its strategic location makes it an important border region, with increased military presence due to security concerns:

   - There is a strong Tunisian armed forces presence along the border with Libya to control migration flows and address security issues[3].
   
   - The border with Algeria also sees increased military activity due to concerns about cross-border movement of militants and smugglers[3].

4. The governorate includes some fenced-off military zones, particularly in the area south of the city of Remada[3]. Travelers are advised to avoid these restricted military areas.

5. The borders with both Algeria and Libya can be subject to closures or increased restrictions due to security situations in the region[3].

This unique geographical position at the intersection of three countries gives Tataouine Governorate significant strategic importance, but also presents challenges in terms of border security and management.
