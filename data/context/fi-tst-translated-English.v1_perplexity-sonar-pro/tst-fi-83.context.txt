I apologize, but I don't have any specific information about a significant event occurring in Finland in 268 BCE. The search results do not provide any details about events in Finland for that exact year. 

Finland's early history, especially from prehistoric times through the Iron Age, is not well documented with precise dates. The information available about this period is largely based on archaeological findings rather than written records. Here's what we can say about the general time period around 268 BCE in Finland:

1. This time falls within Finland's Iron Age, which is considered to have lasted from around 500 BCE to 1300 CE[1][2].

2. Specifically, 268 BCE would be part of the Pre-Roman period of Finland's Iron Age, which lasted from about 500 BCE to 1 BCE[2].

3. During this era, Finland was sparsely populated. The inhabitants were primarily hunter-gatherers, though there's evidence of early agriculture and animal husbandry spreading slowly[1][2].

4. Iron production had started in Finland around 500 BCE, marking the beginning of the Iron Age[1].

5. Trade connections were developing during this period, with furs being a significant export[1].

While these points provide context for the time around 268 BCE, there's no record of a specific significant event occurring exactly in that year in Finland. The lack of written records from this period makes it difficult to pinpoint events to exact dates this far back in Finnish prehistory.
