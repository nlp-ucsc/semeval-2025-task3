Alfred Plé represented France in rowing at the 1920 Summer Olympics[1][2]. Specifically, he competed in the double sculls event alongside his partner Gaston Giran[1]. In this competition, Plé and Giran won the bronze medal[1][2], which was a significant achievement for France in rowing at these Olympics.

The 1920 Summer Olympics were held in Antwerp, Belgium, and the rowing events took place from August 27 to 29[10]. Plé and Giran's performance was part of a successful showing for the French rowing team, which also included a bronze medal in the men's pair with coxswain event[3].

It's worth noting that in the same year as the Olympics, Plé and Giran also won the European title in double sculls[1], demonstrating their prowess in this discipline on both the Olympic and European stages.
