The main source of horror in the F.E.A.R. video game is Alma Wade, a mysterious and powerful psychic girl who serves as the central antagonist[2]. Alma is the primary source of the paranormal and supernatural elements that create the game's eerie and unsettling atmosphere.

F.E.A.R. combines psychological horror with first-person shooter gameplay, drawing inspiration from Japanese horror films like Ringu, The Eye, and Ju-On: The Grudge[2]. The game's approach to horror focuses on creating a subtle, cerebral sense of dread rather than relying on jump scares or overt monsters[2].

Key aspects of the horror in F.E.A.R. include:

1. Psychological tension: The game aims to get under the player's skin by maintaining a constant sense of unease and expectation[2].

2. Atmospheric design: F.E.A.R. uses richly detailed environments, immersive audio, and strategic use of lighting to create a tense, oppressive atmosphere[1][2].

3. Hallucinations and paranormal events: Throughout the game, players experience unsettling visions and supernatural occurrences, often involving Alma[1][3].

4. Isolation: The game creates a feeling of isolation as players navigate through empty, shadowy buildings, enhancing the sense of vulnerability[3].

5. Subtle storytelling: The narrative is presented in a way that provides enough clues for players to form theories about what's happening, while maintaining an air of uncertainty and mystery[2].

While the game includes intense action sequences and firefights, the horror elements are interwoven throughout, creating a unique blend of action and psychological terror. The presence of Alma and the supernatural events surrounding her form the core of the game's horror experience, making F.E.A.R. stand out in the first-person shooter genre[1][3].
