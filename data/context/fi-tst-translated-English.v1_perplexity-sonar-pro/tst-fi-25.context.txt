According to Greek mythology, the mother of the Aloadae (also known as Aloads) was Iphimedia (or Iphimedeia)[1][3][7]. 

Iphimedia was married to Aloeus, but she was in love with Poseidon, the god of the sea. The myth states that Iphimedia would often go down to the seashore, where she would scoop up seawater and pour it into her lap or womb[1][2]. Through this unusual method, she became pregnant by Poseidon.

The children born from this union were the twin giants Otus and Ephialtes, collectively known as the Aloadae[1][2]. Despite being married to Aloeus, Iphimedia's sons were actually fathered by Poseidon, though they took their name (Aloadae, meaning "children of Aloeus") from her husband[7].

Some additional details about Iphimedia and her connection to the Aloadae:

1. In some versions of the myth, Iphimedia also had a daughter named Pancratis[1][8].

2. There's a story where Iphimedia and Pancratis were abducted by Thracian pirates, and the young Aloadae rescued them[7][8].

3. Iphimedia was sometimes worshipped as a heroine, particularly in Mylasia, Caria[8].

4. Her tomb, along with those of her sons, was said to be located in Anthedon, Boeotia[7][8].

This myth illustrates the complex family relationships often found in Greek mythology, where gods frequently interacted with and had children with mortals, leading to heroic or monstrous offspring like the Aloadae.
