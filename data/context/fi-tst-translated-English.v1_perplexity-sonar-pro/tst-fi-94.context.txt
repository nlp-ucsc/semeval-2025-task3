The Tucumán grasshopper, also known as Schistocerca cancellata, is found in several countries in South America. Its distribution area covers:

1. Central and Northern Argentina
2. Uruguay 
3. Paraguay
4. Southern Brazil
5. Southeast Bolivia
6. Central and Northern Chile[6]

The area of origin for demographic explosions (outbreaks) of this grasshopper species extends from:

- Center-Southeast of Catamarca and La Rioja provinces
- East of San Juan province
- North of San Luis and Córdoba provinces 
- Southwest of Santiago del Estero province[6]

When population densities become high, these grasshoppers enter a gregarious phase and can migrate in large swarms to new areas. This allows them to cover great distances. For example:

- In 2017, locust swarms were recorded in multiple provinces of Argentina, including Formosa, Chaco, Santiago del Estero, Córdoba, Tucumán, and the northwest of Santa Fe province.

- More recently, in 2020, a swarm of these grasshoppers returned to Argentina from Paraguay. They crossed through the provinces of Formosa, Chaco, and Santa Fe before settling in Corrientes province from June 19 to early July 2020[6].

The Tucumán grasshopper's ability to form large swarms and migrate over long distances makes it a significant agricultural pest in its range, potentially causing economic impacts in rural areas by damaging crops, pastures, and forests.
