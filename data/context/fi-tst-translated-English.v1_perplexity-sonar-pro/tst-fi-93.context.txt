Geoffrey I of Villehardouin served as the Prince of Achaea, which encompassed much of the Peloponnese, from approximately 1209/1210 to 1229[1][2]. He did not serve under a count, but rather became the ruler of the principality himself after participating in its conquest.

Some key details about Geoffrey I of Villehardouin's rule:

1. He was a French knight from the County of Champagne who joined the Fourth Crusade[1].

2. Along with William of Champlitte, Geoffrey participated in the conquest of the Peloponnese starting in 1205[2][3].

3. Initially, William of Champlitte became the first Prince of Achaea in 1205, with Geoffrey receiving Kalamata and Messenia as fiefs[1].

4. When William of Champlitte returned to France in 1208 and subsequently died in early 1209, Geoffrey succeeded him as the second Prince of Achaea[1][2].

5. Geoffrey I was acknowledged as Prince of Achaea by Henry, the Latin Emperor of Constantinople, at the parliament of Ravennika in May 1209[2].

6. Under his rule, the Principality of Achaea became a direct vassal of the Latin Empire of Constantinople[1].

7. He extended the borders of his principality, capturing important cities like Corinth (1210), Nauplia (1211), and Argos (1212)[2].

8. Geoffrey I ruled the principality until his death, which occurred sometime between 1228 and 1230[1].

In summary, Geoffrey I of Villehardouin did not serve under a count in his role as Prince of Achaea, but rather established himself as an independent ruler of the principality, nominally under the suzerainty of the Latin Empire.
