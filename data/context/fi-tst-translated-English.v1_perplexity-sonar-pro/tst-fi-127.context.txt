Hayley Okines was the face of progeria, a rare genetic disorder that causes premature aging[1][4]. Progeria, also known as Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), is an extremely rare condition that affects approximately 1 in 4-8 million newborns worldwide[4].

Hayley, who was from Bexhill, England, was diagnosed with progeria at the age of two[1]. This condition caused her body to age about eight times faster than normal, giving her the "body of a 104-year-old" despite her young age[4]. 

As a prominent advocate for progeria awareness, Hayley:

1. Participated in clinical trials and research to help advance treatments for the condition[1].
2. Wrote two books about her experiences: "Old Before My Time" and "Young at Heart"[3][4].
3. Appeared in numerous television documentaries and news stories, raising public awareness about progeria[2].
4. Was featured in the ABC special "7 Going on 70"[2].
5. Maintained an active presence on social media, including Facebook and Twitter, to share her story[2].

Hayley's courage and determination in the face of this challenging condition made her an inspiration to many. She lived to be 17 years old, surpassing the average life expectancy of 13 years for those with progeria[1][7]. Hayley passed away on April 2, 2015, after a brief battle with pneumonia[1][4].
