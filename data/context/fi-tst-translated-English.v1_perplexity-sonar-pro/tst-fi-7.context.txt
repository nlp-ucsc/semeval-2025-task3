Moritz Volz had several nicknames during his soccer career, particularly during his time at Fulham. His most common nicknames included:

1. "220 Voltz" or simply "Volzy"[5][6]

2. "The Electrician"[5][6]

3. "Mr. Resistor"[5][6]

4. "The Lightbulb"[5][6]

5. "15,000 Volz" - This nickname was given after he scored the 15,000th goal in Premier League history[3][6]

These electrically-themed nicknames likely stemmed from his surname "Volz" sounding similar to "volts," a unit of electrical potential. 

Interestingly, Volz himself mentioned that he didn't acquire the nickname "Volzy" until he signed for Fulham. Before that, in Germany, he was simply known as "Mo," which he described as "Short and efficient, just the way we like things back home."[9]

Volz was known for his quirky personality and sense of humor, which likely contributed to the variety of nicknames he acquired during his career in English football.
