24 Sussex Drive, the official residence of the Prime Minister of Canada, represents a blend of architectural styles that have evolved over time:

Originally, the house was built in 1867-68 in the Gothic Revival style[1][2]. It was designed by architect J.M. Currier, the brother of the original owner Joseph Merrill Currier[3]. The Gothic Revival influence was evident in its initial design, which featured:

- High gables
- Extensive verandahs
- Liberal use of gingerbread trim
- Asymmetrically placed entrances
- Round-arched windows[1][2]

Over the years, the architectural style of 24 Sussex Drive underwent several transformations:

1. Victorian modifications: In the early 20th century, the house took on more Victorian (Queen Anne) style elements. A turret was added by the Edwards family in 1907, and the house gained a more châteauesque appearance with the addition of towers, oriel windows, and a porte-cochère[2][4].

2. Mid-century modernization: In 1949-1950, when the house was renovated to become the official residence of the Prime Minister, many of its Victorian features were removed. The turret, widow's walk, trim, main gable at the front, verandahs, and porte-cochère were all taken away[2]. This renovation simplified the design, giving it a more restrained and formal appearance.

3. Current style: The present-day 24 Sussex Drive is described as a "mid-century modern take on Norman Revival architecture"[2]. Its current features include:

   - Limestone-clad exterior
   - Relatively unadorned façades
   - Horizontal roof lines
   - Rows of rectangular, shuttered windows[4]

The house now presents a more unified and balanced appearance, which has become significant through its association with the Prime Ministers who have lived there[4]. This evolution in style reflects both changing architectural tastes and the building's transition from a private residence to an official government property.

It's worth noting that the house has been unoccupied since 2015 due to its deteriorating condition, and there are ongoing discussions about its future renovation or potential replacement[7][10].
