Magnar Solberg did not win any World Championship titles in biathlon. However, he did achieve several podium finishes at the World Championships:

1. Silver medals:
   - He won three silver medals in the biathlon relay event in consecutive years: 1969, 1970, and 1971[1][2].

2. Bronze medals:
   - He earned two bronze medals in the individual event, specifically in 1969 and 1971[1][2].

In total, Magnar Solberg's World Championship medal count stands at 5 medals: 3 silver and 2 bronze[2].

It's worth noting that while Solberg didn't secure any World Championship gold medals, he was highly successful at the Olympic level. He won two Olympic gold medals in the 20 km individual event, first at the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble and then again at the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo[1][2]. This achievement made him the first biathlete to successfully defend an Olympic gold medal in the individual event, and he remains the only biathlete to win the 20 km event twice[1].
