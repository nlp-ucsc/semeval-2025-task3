The Brown-headed Parrot (Poicephalus cryptoxanthus) is not found in Finland. This species is native to southeastern Africa and does not naturally occur in Europe[1][3]. 

Key points about the Brown-headed Parrot's distribution and habitat:

1. Native range: The Brown-headed Parrot is endemic to Africa's southeastern corridor, with a large range stretching from South Africa to Kenya[2].

2. Habitat: In the wild, these parrots are found in woodlands, wooded savannas, agricultural areas, and thornveldts (grassland savannas with thorny bushes)[2][3].

3. Preferred environment: They favor tall trees, particularly the iconic African baobab tree[2].

Finland's bird species:

1. As of October 2024, Finland had a total of 501 confirmed bird species[5].

2. The list of birds in Finland does not include the Brown-headed Parrot or any species from the Poicephalus genus[5][7].

3. Finland's avifauna primarily consists of species native to Europe and some migratory birds from other regions, but not African parrots[5].

While the Brown-headed Parrot may be kept as a pet in some parts of the world, including potentially in Finland, it is not a species that naturally occurs in Finnish ecosystems or appears on Finnish bird checklists[7][9][10].
