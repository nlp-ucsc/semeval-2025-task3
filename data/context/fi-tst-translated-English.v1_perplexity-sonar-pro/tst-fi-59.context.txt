Cape Verde first participated in the Olympic Games at the 1996 Summer Olympics held in Atlanta, United States[1][2][3]. This marked the country's debut in the Olympic Games, and they have sent athletes to every Summer Olympics since then[2].

Some key details about Cape Verde's first Olympic appearance:

1. The 1996 Atlanta Games saw Cape Verde send a delegation of four athletes[3].

2. These athletes competed in athletics events[3]:
   - Three men: Alfayaya Embalo (100 meters), Henry Andrade (110 meters hurdles), and António Zeferino (marathon)
   - One woman: Isménia do Frederico (100 meters)

3. António Zeferino competed in the marathon, finishing 94th with a time of 2:34:13[3].

4. This was Cape Verde's largest Olympic delegation until the 2016 Rio Games, which saw five athletes participate[7].

5. Cape Verde's National Olympic Committee, the Comité Olímpico Caboverdeano, was formed in 1989 and officially recognized by the International Olympic Committee in 1993[2][5].

Since their debut in 1996, Cape Verde has continued to participate in every Summer Olympics but has never sent athletes to the Winter Olympics[2][5]. The country had not won any Olympic medals until the 2024 Paris Olympics, where Daniel Varela de Pina won a bronze medal in Men's Flyweight Boxing, marking Cape Verde's first-ever Olympic medal[7][9].
