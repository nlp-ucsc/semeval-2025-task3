The first warship built in Germany after World War I was the Deutschland, a "pocket battleship" or "armored ship" (Panzerschiff) of the Deutschland class[1][4]. 

After World War I, Germany's naval capabilities were severely restricted by the Treaty of Versailles. However, in the late 1920s and early 1930s, Germany began to rebuild its navy, initially within the constraints of the treaty. The Deutschland was laid down in 1929 and launched in 1931[5]. 

This ship represented a significant step in the formation of a modern German fleet after World War I. The Deutschland was designed to outgun any cruiser fast enough to catch it, while being faster than any battleship that could outgun it. This design philosophy was aimed at circumventing the treaty restrictions while still producing a powerful warship[5].

The Deutschland class, consisting of Deutschland (later renamed LÃ¼tzow), Admiral Scheer, and Admiral Graf Spee, was officially classified as "armored ships" (Panzerschiffe) by Germany. However, they were often referred to as "pocket battleships" by other nations due to their relatively small size but powerful armament[5].

It's worth noting that while Deutschland was the first major warship built after World War I, Germany had been working on smaller vessels and had been developing naval technology through various means, including secret collaborations with other countries, in the years following the war[2][5].

The construction of Deutschland and her sister ships marked the beginning of Germany's naval rearmament, which would accelerate significantly after the rise of the Nazi Party to power in 1933 and the signing of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement in 1935[5].
