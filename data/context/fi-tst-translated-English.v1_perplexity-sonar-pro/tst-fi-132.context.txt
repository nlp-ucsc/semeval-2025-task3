The flag of Terengganu consists of a black field with a white border and a white crescent moon and star emblem[3]. The crescent and star are positioned in the center of the flag, with the points of both symbols facing towards the fly (right side) of the flag[3].

This design represents the current flag of Terengganu, which has been in use since 1947. However, it's worth noting that Terengganu's flag has undergone changes throughout history:

1. From 1912 to 1933, the flag featured a white field with a black triangle at the hoist side[4].

2. Between 1933 and 1947, the flag had a more complex design with four triangles (black, red, yellow, and white) arranged in a pinwheel pattern[1][2].

The current black and white design with the crescent and star is a powerful symbol of Terengganu's Islamic heritage and its status as one of Malaysia's states. The simplicity of the black and white color scheme, combined with the iconic crescent and star, creates a striking and memorable flag that represents the identity of Terengganu.
