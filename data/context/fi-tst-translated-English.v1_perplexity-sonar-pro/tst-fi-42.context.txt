Agkístri belongs to the Saronic Islands group[1][2]. The Saronic Islands are located in the Saronic Gulf, which is part of the Aegean Sea near Athens, Greece. 

Some key details about Agkístri and its location:

1. Agkístri is a small island in the Saronic Gulf, very close to the larger Saronic island of Aegina[1][2].

2. It can be reached from Aegina by boat in just 10 minutes, and is about an hour's boat ride from the port of Piraeus in Athens[1][2].

3. Agkístri is one of the smaller islands in the Saronic group, with a land area of only 13.367 km² (5.161 sq mi)[2].

4. The island has three main settlements: Milos (Megalochori), Skala, and Limenaria[1][2].

5. Like other Saronic Islands, Agkístri is a popular destination for Athenians due to its proximity to Athens and its natural beauty[4].

The Saronic Islands are one of the traditional subdivisions of the Aegean Islands. Other major island groups in the Aegean include the Cyclades, Dodecanese, and Northeastern Aegean Islands[3]. However, Agkístri is specifically part of the Saronic group, known for its accessibility from Athens and its popularity as a quick getaway destination.
