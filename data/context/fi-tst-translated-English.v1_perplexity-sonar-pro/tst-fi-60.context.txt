Maroilles is a soft cheese made from cow's milk[1][2][3]. It originates from the Maroilles region in northern France, specifically in the areas of Picardy and Nord-Pas-de-Calais[2][4].

Key characteristics of Maroilles cheese production include:

1. Milk source: It is made exclusively from cow's milk[3][8].

2. Milk treatment: Artisanal versions are made with raw milk, while industrial versions use pasteurized milk[5][6].

3. Coagulation: Traditional rennet is used in the cheese-making process[6].

4. Aging process: 
   - The cheese is aged for at least 5 weeks, though periods of up to 4 months are not uncommon[4].
   - During aging, it is placed in damp cellars where it develops its characteristic features[3].

5. Washing process: 
   - The cheese is regularly washed with salt water during the ripening period[3][4].
   - This washing process gives Maroilles its distinctive orange-red rind, pungent aroma, and robust flavor[2][4].

6. Shape and size: Maroilles comes in a square shape, typically measuring 13cm on each side and 6cm in thickness for the standard size[3][4].

The production of Maroilles is regulated by AOC (Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée) status, which it received in 1976, followed by AOP (Appellation d'Origine Protégée) status in 1996[4]. This ensures that the cheese is produced according to traditional methods in its designated region of origin.
