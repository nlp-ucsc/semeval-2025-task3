The eye socket, also known as the orbit, contains several openings or foramina that allow for the passage of important nerves, blood vessels, and other structures. The main openings in the eye socket are:

1. Optic foramen (canal): This is the largest and most important opening, located at the apex of the orbit. It transmits the optic nerve (cranial nerve II) and the ophthalmic artery[5].

2. Superior orbital fissure: This is a large opening that allows for the passage of several cranial nerves (III, IV, V1, and VI) and blood vessels[1].

3. Inferior orbital fissure: This fissure is located between the maxilla and the greater wing of the sphenoid bone, allowing for the passage of nerves and blood vessels[5].

4. Nasolacrimal canal: This opening is located in the medial wall of the orbit and contains the nasolacrimal duct, which drains tears from the eye into the nasal cavity[1].

5. Infraorbital foramen: While not strictly within the orbit, this opening is located just below the orbital rim and allows for the passage of the infraorbital nerve and vessels[5].

6. Supraorbital foramen (or notch): This opening is located in the superior orbital rim and allows for the passage of the supraorbital nerve and vessels[5].

7. Anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramina: These small openings are located in the medial wall of the orbit and allow for the passage of the ethmoidal nerves and vessels[5].

It's important to note that while these are the main openings, the exact number and size of foramina can vary slightly between individuals. Additionally, some of these openings, like the superior and inferior orbital fissures, are larger gaps rather than discrete holes. The complex arrangement of these openings allows for the intricate network of nerves and blood vessels that support the eye and surrounding structures to enter and exit the orbital cavity[1][5].
