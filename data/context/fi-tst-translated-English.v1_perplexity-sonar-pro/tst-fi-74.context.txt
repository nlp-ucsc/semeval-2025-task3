Sergei Parajanov was sentenced to five years in prison in 1974 on charges of homosexuality, sodomy, and dissemination of pornography[1][3][4]. However, these charges were widely believed to be politically motivated and fabricated. The real reasons for his imprisonment were likely:

1. His opposition to Soviet authorities and support for Ukrainian nationalism[1][3]. Parajanov had been involved in protests against the 1965-1966 Ukrainian purge and signed petitions criticizing secret trials of intellectuals[4].

2. His departure from the state-sanctioned socialist realism style in his films, which were seen as subversive by Soviet authorities[2][5].

3. His outspoken criticism of the state of Soviet cinema and authorities during a speech in Minsk, Belarus[7].

4. His influence on younger colleagues and expression of ideologically "harmful" opinions, as noted in KGB reports[1][4].

5. His friendship with the family of Petro Shelest, the former first secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party who had been removed from office[4].

The charges of homosexuality and pornography were likely used as a pretext to imprison Parajanov for his political activities and artistic nonconformity[3][4]. In 2024, the National Rehabilitation Commission of Ukraine officially acquitted Parajanov posthumously, concluding that his prosecution and conviction were politically motivated[3].
