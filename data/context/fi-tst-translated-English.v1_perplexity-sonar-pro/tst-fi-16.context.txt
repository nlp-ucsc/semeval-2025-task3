The original name of Kaspiysk was Dvigatelstroy (Дви́гательстро́й)[1]. This name was based on the Russian word for "engine" and reflected the city's origins as a worker's encampment servicing a nearby naval diesel engine manufacturer called Dagdizel[1].

Kaspiysk began in 1932 as this worker's settlement[1]. During World War II, the site experienced significant growth due to the war effort and became a center for major arms producers[1]. In 1947, the settlement was granted city status and given its current name, Kaspiysk, which reflects its location on the shores of the Caspian Sea[1].

The transition from Dvigatelstroy to Kaspiysk thus marks the evolution of the settlement from a small industrial camp to a full-fledged city, with its new name emphasizing its geographical location rather than its industrial origins.
