HMY Britannia was the 83rd royal yacht in British history[1][2]. She served the British monarchy from 1954 to 1997, continuing a long tradition of royal yachts that dates back to 1660 when King Charles II acceded to the throne[1][2]. 

Some key points about HMY Britannia's place in the lineage of royal yachts:

1. Historical context: The tradition of royal yachts in Britain spans over 300 years, with Britannia being the most recent in this long line[1].

2. Predecessor: Britannia was the second royal yacht to bear this name. The first Britannia was a racing cutter built for the Prince of Wales in 1893[1][2].

3. Significance: As the 83rd and last royal yacht, Britannia holds a special place in British maritime history. She became one of the most famous ships in the world during her 43-year career[4].

4. Commissioning: Britannia was originally commissioned by King George VI, Queen Elizabeth II's father, in 1952. However, he passed away before the yacht's construction began[3].

5. Legacy: Since her decommissioning in 1997, Britannia has not been replaced. She remains the last of the British royal yachts, marking the end of a centuries-old tradition[1][2].

Britannia's status as the 83rd royal yacht underscores her historical importance and the long-standing relationship between the British monarchy and maritime traditions.
