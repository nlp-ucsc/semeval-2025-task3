Aukštojas Hill is named after Aukštojas (also spelled Aukštėjas), an important deity from ancient Lithuanian mythology[1][2][4]. 

Specifically:

1. The hill was unnamed until 2004, when it was discovered to be the highest point in Lithuania[3][4].

2. After its discovery, a national competition was held to name the newly found highest point[3][4].

3. The winning proposal came from Libertas Klimka, a professor of history at the Pedagogical University of Vilnius[3].

4. Klimka suggested naming the hill after Aukštojas, who was considered one of the most important deities in Lithuanian pagan mythology[2][3].

5. In Lithuanian mythology, Aukštojas was regarded as the supreme heavenly deity and the creator of the world[2][8].

6. The name became official on November 18, 2005[1].

Aukštojas was chosen as a way to connect the highest geographical point in Lithuania with an important figure from the country's ancient religious beliefs. This naming reflects Lithuania's rich pagan heritage, as the country was one of the last in Europe to adopt Christianity[3].
