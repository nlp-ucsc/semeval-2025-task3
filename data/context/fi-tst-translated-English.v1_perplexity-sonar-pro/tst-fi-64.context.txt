False sabertooth cat fossils, belonging to the families Nimravidae and Barbourofelidae, have been found in several locations across North America and Eurasia. Here's a detailed overview of their fossil distribution:

## North America

North America has yielded numerous false sabertooth cat fossils:

- **Florida**: Fossils of Barbourofelis loveorum have been discovered in the Love Bone Bed of Alachua County, dating back to the late Miocene epoch (about 8 to 9.5 million years ago)[1].

- **California**: Barbourofelis loveorum fossils have also been found in California, dating to the late Clarendonian period[1].

- **Oklahoma**: Early Hemphillian fossils of Barbourofelis loveorum have been unearthed in Oklahoma[1].

- **Nebraska**: Fossils of a larger species, Barbourofelis fricki, have been discovered in Nebraska[1].

- **Nevada**: Barbourofelis fricki fossils have also been found in Nevada[1].

- **South Dakota**: The White River Formation in South Dakota has yielded fossils of Dinictis squalidens and Hoplophoneus primaevus[2][3].

- **Oregon**: A trackway believed to belong to a false sabertooth cat was recently discovered at the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument[10].

## Eurasia

False sabertooth cat fossils have also been found in Eurasia:

- **Asia**: Nimravid fossils have been discovered in Asia, dating back to approximately the same time as the North American fossils (late Eocene)[6].

- **Turkey**: A highly evolved form of Barbourofelis has been found in Turkey, suggesting that the genus may have dispersed back into Asia in the late Miocene[1].

## Temporal Distribution

The fossil record of false sabertooth cats spans a significant period:

- The earliest recognizable nimravid fossils date from the late Eocene, about 37 million years ago[5].
- Nimravid diversity appears to have peaked around 28 million years ago[5].
- The last known barbourofelid remains date to the Messinian stage of the Miocene, approximately 7.2 million years ago[5][6].

These fossil discoveries have provided valuable insights into the evolution and distribution of false sabertooth cats. They indicate that these predators were widespread across North America and Eurasia during the Eocene, Oligocene, and Miocene epochs, adapting to various environments and playing significant roles in their respective ecosystems.
