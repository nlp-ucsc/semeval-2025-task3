Ethel Smyth received private lessons from the following composers:

1. Alexander Ewing: After returning home from school in Putney, Smyth received tuition from Alexander Ewing, who became her friend and mentor. Ewing encouraged her musical aspirations and helped develop her talent[2].

2. Heinrich von Herzogenberg: After leaving the Leipzig Conservatory, Smyth began taking private lessons from Heinrich von Herzogenberg, an Austrian composer known for his admiration of Brahms' music[1][6][7][8]. Von Herzogenberg and his wife Elisabeth introduced Smyth to prominent European composers, including Brahms, Clara Schumann, and Tchaikovsky[4].

These private lessons, particularly those with von Herzogenberg, were instrumental in shaping Smyth's musical education and career. Through von Herzogenberg, Smyth gained access to high-level music circles in Germany and was able to observe and learn from some of the most renowned composers of her time[6].
