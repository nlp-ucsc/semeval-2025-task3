Laurance Rockefeller had four children with his wife Mary French:

1. Laura Rockefeller Chasin
2. Marion Rockefeller Weber  
3. Dr. Lucy R. Waletzky
4. Laurance S. "Larry" Rockefeller Jr.[1][2][3]

Laurance and Mary were married in 1934 and had three daughters and one son[1][2]. Their children went on to have families of their own, with Laurance Rockefeller having eight grandchildren and twelve great-grandchildren by the time of his death in 2004[1].

The Rockefeller children were raised with the family's values of philanthropy, conservation, and responsible wealth management. Like their parents, they became involved in various charitable and environmental causes[4]. For example, Laurance Rockefeller Jr. became an environmental lawyer who worked for 25 years at the Natural Resources Defense Council[6].
