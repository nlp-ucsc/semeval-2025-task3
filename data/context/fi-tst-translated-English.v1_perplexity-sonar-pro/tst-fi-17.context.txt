Adolf Galland had three brothers who served in the Luftwaffe during World War II:

1. Paul Galland:
- Served as a fighter pilot in the Luftwaffe
- Flew with Jagdgeschwader 26 "Schlageter" on the Western Front
- Achieved 17 aerial victories in 107 combat missions
- Was killed in action on October 31, 1942, shot down by RAF Spitfire fighters[1][2]

2. Wilhelm-Ferdinand Galland:
- Also served as a fighter pilot
- Became a fighter ace, credited with 54 aerial victories
- Was shot down on August 17, 1943[2]

3. Fritz Galland:
- The eldest Galland brother
- Initially joined the flak (anti-aircraft) arm of the Luftwaffe
- Later trained as a fighter pilot, possibly influenced by his brothers' achievements
- Served with JG 3 and flew Bf 109s with 7./JG 5 during the summer of 1942
- Was reportedly demoted from his rank at some point[9][10]

All four Galland brothers served in the Luftwaffe during World War II, with Adolf being the most famous and successful. Paul and Wilhelm-Ferdinand became fighter aces, while Fritz's combat record is less clear. Tragically, both Paul and Wilhelm-Ferdinand were killed in action during the war.
