Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi, commonly known as HJK Helsinki, was founded by Fredrik Wathén on June 19, 1907[1][3]. Wathén was Finland's first champion in speed skating, and he established the club at a founding meeting held at a bowling alley in Kaisaniemi Park in Helsinki[1].

Some key points about the club's founding and early history:

1. The club was initially established as "Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi – Helsingfors Fotbollsklubb," reflecting both Finnish and Swedish languages[1].

2. HJK quickly became popular among Finnish-speaking students, while Swedish-speaking students tended to prefer other clubs like Unitas or HIFK[1].

3. In 1909, the club adopted its iconic blue and white colors to support the fennoman movement, which promoted Finnish language and culture[1].

4. The club's first competitive match was played against Ekenäs IF in Ekenäs, with HJK winning 4-2[1].

5. HJK won its first championship title in 1911, just four years after its founding[1].

Fredrik Wathén's tenure as the club's chairman was relatively short-lived. In 1909, he was forced to leave his post due to illness[1]. Despite his brief leadership, Wathén's vision laid the foundation for what would become Finland's most successful football club, with a record 33 championship titles to date[1][4].
