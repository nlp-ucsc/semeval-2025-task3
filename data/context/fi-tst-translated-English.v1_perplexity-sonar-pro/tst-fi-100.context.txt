The Alemanni are first mentioned in written sources in 213 CE, when the Roman historian Cassius Dio records the campaigns of Emperor Caracalla against them[1][2][3]. This is widely considered their first definitive appearance in historical records.

Some key points about the Alemanni's first historical mention:

1. Cassius Dio's account: Dio describes Caracalla's interactions with a Germanic group he calls the "Alamannoi" during a campaign in 213 CE[4].

2. Earlier possible references: While 213 CE is considered the first definitive mention, some historians argue that the Alemanni may be connected to earlier groups:

   - The Suebi: Mentioned by Tacitus in 98 CE in his work "Germania"[1][3]. However, equating the Suebi directly with the Alemanni is debated among scholars.
   
   - Ammianus Marcellinus: This later Roman historian retrospectively uses the name "Alemanni" to refer to Germans on the Roman frontier around 98-99 CE[2]. However, this is likely anachronistic.

3. Context of first appearance: When first mentioned by Cassius Dio, the Alemanni were already a significant force:
   
   - They occupied regions south of the Main River and east of the Rhine[1][3].
   - They were powerful enough to request help from Rome against neighboring tribes[5].

4. Caracalla's campaign: The emperor initially responded to the Alemanni's request for aid, but then betrayed them, attempting to conquer them instead[3].

5. Scholarly consensus: Despite some debates about earlier connections, most historians cite Cassius Dio's 213 CE account as the first clear historical mention of the Alemanni[3].

In summary, while there are some earlier possible references, the Alemanni definitively enter written history in 213 CE through Cassius Dio's account of Caracalla's campaign against them.
