The Fratellis is a Scottish rock band from Glasgow, formed in 2005. The band consists of three core members:

1. Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler) - Lead vocals, guitar, piano, and keyboards[1][3][7]

2. Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace) - Bass guitar and backing vocals[1][3][7]

3. Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory) - Drums, backing vocals, and occasional guitar and banjo[1][3][7]

In addition to the core members, the band has been supported by touring musicians:

4. Will Foster - Keyboards and piano (2008–present), and guitar (2008–2009)[3][7]

More recently, their live performances have included additional touring members:

5. Ryan Quigley - Trumpet (2021–present)[3]

6. Paul Towndrow - Saxophones (2021–present)[3]

7. The Wild Tonics - Backing vocals (2021–present)[3]

It's worth noting that despite sharing the same stage name "Fratelli," the band members are not actually related. They took their name from the villains in the film "The Goonies," although by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is Fratelli[1].
