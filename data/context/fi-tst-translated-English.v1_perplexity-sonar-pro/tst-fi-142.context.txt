The occupation of Japan occurred from 1945 to 1952, immediately following Japan's defeat and surrender in World War II[1][3]. This period began after Japan formally surrendered on September 2, 1945, with the signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender[3]. The occupation officially ended on April 28, 1952, when the Treaty of San Francisco came into effect, restoring full sovereignty to Japan[3].

During this roughly seven-year period, Japan was under the control of the Allied Powers, primarily led by the United States under the supreme command of General Douglas MacArthur[1][3]. The occupation was a significant turning point in Japanese history, marking the transition from Imperial Japan to a democratic nation aligned with Western powers.

Key aspects of the occupation included:

1. Initial focus on demilitarization and democratization of Japan[3][9].
2. Implementation of major reforms in government, economy, and society[1][9].
3. Adoption of a new constitution in 1947, often referred to as the "MacArthur Constitution"[1][9].
4. Land reform and the breakup of zaibatsu (large industrial conglomerates)[1].
5. Repatriation of Japanese soldiers and civilians from abroad[1].
6. War crimes trials, including the execution of seven wartime leaders[1].

The occupation period is considered a crucial phase in modern Japanese history, as it laid the foundation for Japan's post-war development as a democratic and economically powerful nation[9]. The reforms and changes implemented during this time continue to shape Japanese society and its relationship with the United States and other nations to this day.
