Oak bracket, scientifically known as Pseudoinonotus dryadeus (formerly Inonotus dryadeus), is a parasitic fungus that primarily affects oak trees. Here are the key details about oak bracket:

Description:
Oak bracket is a large, bracket-like fungus that grows at the base of trees, typically oaks. The fruiting body, called a conk, varies in size from 5 to 30 cm in width, though specimens up to 75 cm have been found[5]. The conk has a distinctive appearance:

- Upper surface: Cream to rusty brown with a yellower margin, velvety or slightly hairy texture[1][4]
- Underside: Greyish-white initially, turning yellow or ochre with age, containing fine pores (4-6 per mm)[4][5]
- Texture: Thick and fibrous, becoming harder and more uneven with age[4]
- Liquid secretion: Young fruiting bodies exude an amber or orange-brown liquid, giving it the nickname "weeping conk"[1][4]

Habitat and Distribution:
Oak bracket is most commonly found on oak trees but can also affect other hardwoods like beech, birch, alder, maple, elm, and chestnut[1][2]. It's more prevalent in the southern and eastern parts of England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, but rare in northern Britain[6]. The fungus also occurs in temperate parts of Europe and North America[2][5].

Biology and Impact:
Pseudoinonotus dryadeus is a parasitic fungus that causes white rot in the roots and base of living trees[1][7]. It enters the tree through wounds in the bark and can lead to:

1. Decay of roots and the base of the trunk
2. Weakening of the tree's structure, making it susceptible to falling
3. General canopy decline, including sparse foliage and branch dieback[1][7]

The presence of oak bracket indicates that the lower portion of the tree has been compromised, which may not be immediately visible from the outside[1].

Management:
There are no effective fungicide treatments for oak bracket. Management strategies include:

1. Regular inspection of trees by certified arborists
2. Removal of severely damaged trees
3. Implementing proper tree care practices to maintain tree health and prevent wounds[1]

Identification Tips:
- Look for large, bracket-like growths at the base of oak trees
- Check for the characteristic "weeping" or oozing of amber liquid from young fruiting bodies
- Note the creamy brown to rusty color and pitted surface
- Observe the seasonal appearance, typically in late summer to early winter[1][4]

Understanding oak bracket is crucial for tree care professionals and property owners with oak trees, as early detection can help in managing the health and safety of affected trees.
