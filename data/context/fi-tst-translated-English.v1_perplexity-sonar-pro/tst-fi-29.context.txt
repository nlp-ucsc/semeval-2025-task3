The Cuban men's national volleyball team has won one Olympic medal in their history:

A bronze medal at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal[1][5].

Some key points about Cuba's Olympic volleyball performance:

1. This bronze medal in 1976 remains their only Olympic podium finish in men's volleyball[1][5].

2. Cuba first appeared in Olympic volleyball in 1972, finishing 10th[1][5].

3. After their bronze medal in 1976, their next best Olympic result was 4th place in 1992[1][5].

4. Cuba qualified but withdrew from the 1984 and 1988 Olympics due to boycotts[1][5].

5. Their most recent Olympic appearance was in 2016, where they finished 11th[1][5].

6. Cuba has not qualified for the men's volleyball tournament in the last two Olympics (2020 Tokyo and 2024 Paris)[1][5].

While Cuba has achieved success in other international volleyball competitions, including World Championships and World Cups, their Olympic success has been limited to that single bronze medal in 1976. This contrasts with their women's team, which has been more successful at the Olympics, winning three consecutive gold medals from 1992 to 2000[7].
