2. "Dharma & Greg" (ABC, 1997-2002): In this series, Rachins portrayed Larry Finkelstein, the hippie father of Dharma[1][2][3]. This role showcased his versatility as an actor, as it was significantly different from his previous character on "L.A. Law."

Law" was particularly significant, as it was one of the most watched shows on television during its peak and set the standard for many ensemble dramas that followed[1]. His performances in these two series solidified Rachins' status as a versatile and recognizable television actor, capable of excelling in both dramatic and comedic roles[2][3].
