Cornelia 'Nycke' Groot from the Netherlands was chosen as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the 2016 Women's European Handball Championship[1][3]. 

Some key details about Nycke Groot's performance and recognition at the 2016 EHF EURO:

1. She played as the centre back for the Netherlands national team[1].

2. Groot was named to the All-Star Team of the tournament in the centre back position[1].

3. In addition to being named MVP, she was also part of the All-Star Team, highlighting her exceptional performance throughout the championship[3].

4. The Netherlands finished as runners-up in the tournament, losing to Norway in the final[3].

5. Groot's selection as MVP came in a year when there were several other strong contenders, including Nora MÃ¸rk of Norway and Cristina Neagu of Romania, who were also standout performers at the championship[4].

It's worth noting that while Groot was named MVP of the European Championship, Cristina Neagu of Romania was later voted as the IHF World Player of the Year for 2016, considering her performances across all competitions that year[4][9]. This highlights the high level of competition and talent in women's handball during that period.
