The Infiniti G20 was marketed with the slogan "Born in Japan. Educated in Europe. Now Available in America."[4]

This tagline was used in advertisements for the second-generation G20 introduced in 1998. It emphasized the car's Japanese origins and European-inspired design and engineering, positioning it as a sophisticated entry-level luxury sedan for the American market.

The slogan aimed to highlight a few key aspects of the G20:

1. Japanese quality and engineering ("Born in Japan")
2. European-inspired handling and styling ("Educated in Europe")
3. Availability as a new option for American luxury car buyers

This marketing approach attempted to differentiate the G20 from both its Japanese competitors and established European luxury brands. By emphasizing its international pedigree, Infiniti sought to present the G20 as a unique blend of Japanese reliability, European driving dynamics, and American market suitability.

It's worth noting that this slogan represented a shift from Infiniti's earlier, more abstract marketing for models like the Q45, which had been criticized for not effectively showcasing the actual vehicles[8]. With the G20, Infiniti adopted a more direct approach to communicate the car's features and appeal to potential buyers.
