Charles Camilleri (1931-2009) is mainly known as Malta's foremost composer and one of the most innovative composers of his time. He is recognized for several key contributions:

1. Maltese folk music influence: Camilleri is renowned for incorporating Maltese folk music into his compositions, similar to how Vaughan Williams did for England[1][3]. He collected and developed Malta's folk music in many of his works, most notably the Malta Suite[1][3].

2. Diverse compositional output: Over his six-decade career, Camilleri composed in almost every genre, including orchestral works, chamber music, concertos, operas, ballets, and oratorios[4]. He wrote over 300 compositions, 150 of which have been published by major publishers[2].

3. Significant works:
   - Malta Suite (1946): One of his earliest and most popular works[1][3]
   - Missa Mundi (1972): A massive organ work described as "the organ's Rite of Spring"[1][3]
   - Pawlu ta' Malta (1985): The first oratorio in the Maltese language[2][4]
   - Il-Weghda (1984): One of the first operas in Maltese[2][4]

4. Fusion of musical styles: Camilleri was known for blending Western and non-Western musical elements, creating a unique "universal" style that incorporated influences from Africa and Asia[1][4].

5. Academic contributions: He served as the first professor of music at the University of Malta (1992-1996) and also taught at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto[2][4].

6. Cultural impact: Camilleri significantly raised the level of music-making in Malta and inspired generations of musicians[3]. His works continue to be performed regularly in Malta and occasionally internationally, particularly in the UK[4].

In essence, Charles Camilleri is primarily known for his role in elevating Maltese music to the international stage, his innovative compositional style that blended diverse influences, and his substantial contribution to Malta's musical heritage.
