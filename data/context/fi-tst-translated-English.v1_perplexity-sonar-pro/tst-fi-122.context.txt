The center of Stryn village is simply called Stryn Center or Stryn Centrum. It serves as the administrative and commercial hub for the surrounding municipality. 

Stryn Center is described as a busy and developing small village located at the tip of the northernmost branch of the inner Nordfjorden[2]. As the main urban area in the municipality, it contains:

- The municipal administration offices
- A school
- A commercial center with shops and businesses
- Hotels like Visnes Hotel and Stryn Hotel
- Cafes such as Stryn Vertshus
- The local bus station
- The intersection of major roads (Norwegian National Road 15 and Norwegian County Road 60)[1][2]

The village center provides essential services for both locals and tourists visiting the scenic Stryn area. It's described as a junction point connecting inner Nordfjord with the rest of Norway[2]. While relatively small, Stryn Center acts as an important hub for the wider municipality, offering amenities, accommodation, and transport links for those exploring the surrounding fjords, mountains, and glaciers that make the region famous[3][4].
