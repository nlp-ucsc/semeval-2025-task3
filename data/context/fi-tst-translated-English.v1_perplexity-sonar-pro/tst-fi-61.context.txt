Kalervo Rauhala was an Olympic silver medalist in Greco-Roman wrestling[1][3]. Specifically, he won the silver medal in the middleweight class (79 kg) at the 1952 Summer Olympics held in Helsinki, Finland[1][3][7].

Rauhala competed for Finland in the Greco-Roman wrestling middleweight division. In the final round of the competition, he faced Axel Gr√∂nberg of Sweden, who won the gold medal. Nikolay Belov of the Soviet Union took the bronze medal in this event[7].

In addition to his Olympic success, Rauhala also achieved international recognition by winning a bronze medal in the Greco-Roman middleweight category at the 1953 World Championships[3].

Rauhala's wrestling career was notable on the domestic level as well. He won multiple Finnish national titles in both Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling throughout the 1950s[3].

It's worth mentioning that wrestling has been a strong tradition in the Rauhala family. Kalervo's nephews, Jukka and Pekka Rauhala, also represented Finland in wrestling at the Olympic Games, with Jukka winning a bronze medal in freestyle lightweight at the 1984 Olympics[2][3].
