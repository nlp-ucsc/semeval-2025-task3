Pietro Nenni represented the Italian Socialist Party (PSI). He was a prominent figure in Italian socialist politics for several decades and served as the national secretary of the PSI multiple times[2][3].

Some key points about Nenni's involvement with the Italian Socialist Party:

1. He joined the PSI in 1921 after leaving the Italian Republican Party[2][3].

2. Nenni became the editor of Avanti!, the official newspaper of the PSI, in 1923[2].

3. He served as the national secretary (leader) of the PSI on three separate occasions[4]:
   - From 1931 to 1945 while in exile
   - From 1949 to 1963 
   - From 1966 to 1969

4. Under Nenni's leadership in the 1960s, the PSI entered into center-left coalition governments with the Christian Democrats[2][3].

5. Nenni facilitated the PSI's shift away from close ties with the Communists and towards supporting NATO membership in the 1950s and 1960s[2].

6. He served as Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister in several Italian governments as a representative of the PSI[3].

7. In 1964, a left-wing faction split from Nenni's PSI to form the Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity (PSIUP) in opposition to the PSI's cooperation with centrist parties[7].

Throughout his long political career spanning over 50 years, Pietro Nenni remained closely associated with and was a key leader of the Italian Socialist Party, shaping its policies and direction for much of the 20th century.
