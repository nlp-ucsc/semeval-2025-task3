Frances Farmer was sentenced to 180 days in jail in 1942 due to a series of incidents that culminated in her arrest and court appearance. The key events leading to her sentencing were:

1. On October 19, 1942, Farmer was initially arrested in Santa Monica for driving with her headlights on in a wartime "dim-out" zone[1][3]. During this incident, she got into an altercation with the police officer, reportedly telling him "You bore me"[1].

2. She was charged with drunken driving, driving without a license, and failure to obey dim-out restrictions[1]. At this time, she was fined $250 and given a suspended 180-day jail sentence[1].

3. Farmer only paid half of the fine, promising to pay the rest later[1]. However, she failed to pay the remaining amount, which led to a warrant being issued for her arrest in January 1943[2].

4. On January 14, 1943, police found Farmer at the Knickerbocker Hotel, where she had been sleeping naked and drunk[2]. She was taken into custody to face the consequences of her unpaid fine.

5. In court, Farmer admitted to drinking "everything I could get my hands on, including Benzedrine"[2]. Her behavior in the courtroom was erratic and violent. She reportedly "floored a matron, bruised an officer, and suffered some rufflement on her own part" when police refused to let her use a telephone after her sentencing[2][5].

6. Given her behavior and failure to comply with previous court orders, the judge sentenced Farmer to 180 days in jail[2][3].

It's important to note that Farmer's sentencing was the result of multiple factors, including her initial traffic violation, subsequent failure to pay her fine, and her erratic behavior in court. Her substance abuse issues, which she openly admitted to, likely contributed to her actions and the judge's decision[3][5].
