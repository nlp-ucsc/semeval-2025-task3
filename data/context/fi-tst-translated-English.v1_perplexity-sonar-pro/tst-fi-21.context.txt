Gergely Kulcs치r won his first major medal at the 1958 European Championships in Stockholm, where he secured a bronze medal in the javelin throw[2][4]. This was a significant achievement for Kulcs치r, as it marked his debut on the international athletics stage. Despite being ranked only 22nd in the world that year, he managed to finish third and claim a spot on the podium[4].

This bronze medal at the 1958 European Championships in Stockholm launched Kulcs치r's successful career in javelin throwing. It set the stage for his future Olympic successes, where he would go on to win multiple medals[1][4]:

1. Bronze medal at the 1960 Olympics in Rome
2. Silver medal at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo
3. Bronze medal at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City

Kulcs치r's performance at the 1958 European Championships was particularly impressive considering it was his first major international appearance[4]. This early success foreshadowed his future achievements and established him as a prominent figure in Hungarian athletics.
