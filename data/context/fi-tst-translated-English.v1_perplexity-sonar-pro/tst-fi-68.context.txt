Ian Callum designed the Aston Martin V12 Vanquish[5][6][8][9]. As the styling chief for Aston Martin at the time, Callum was responsible for creating the elegant and classic body design of this iconic sports car[1][8].

The design process for the V12 Vanquish began in the mid-1990s with a concept car called "Project Vantage"[6][9]. This concept, which debuted at the 1998 Detroit Motor Show, showcased many of the design elements that would eventually make their way into the production V12 Vanquish[2][6].

Callum's design for the V12 Vanquish was intended to reflect the pedigree, heritage, and tradition of Aston Martin[1]. It featured a bold and dynamic appearance with finely detailed elements for both the exterior and interior[1]. Some key design features included:

1. A distinctive radiator grille and lower air intake
2. Auxiliary driving lamps and front direction turn indicators
3. Compound curves on the front wings and bonnet panels
4. A steeply raked windscreen and low curving roofline
5. Deeply sculptured sill and door panels
6. Prominent rear wheel arches
7. A short tail section with an integrated rear spoiler[1]

The V12 Vanquish design was a significant step forward for Aston Martin, setting the stage for the company's future models[5]. Callum's work on this car, along with his earlier design of the DB7, helped establish the modern design language for Aston Martin that continues to influence their vehicles today[9].
