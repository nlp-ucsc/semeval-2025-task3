Oxford University defeated Royal Engineers in the 1874 FA Cup final[1][2]. The match took place on March 14, 1874 at Kennington Oval in London[2]. Oxford University won the game 2-0, with goals from Charles Mackarness in the 10th minute and Frederick Patton in the 20th minute[1][2].

This was the third FA Cup final, and both teams had previously reached the final but lost to Wanderers in earlier years[1]. Oxford University had defeated two-time former winners Wanderers in the earlier rounds to reach this final[2].

Some key details about the match:

- Attendance was around 2,000 spectators[1][2]
- Oxford's goalkeeper Charles Nepean played a crucial role in preserving the clean sheet[1]
- Royal Engineers had undertaken two weeks of special training before the match, which was an innovative approach at the time[2]
- Oxford captain Cuthbert Ottaway and Robert Vidal (nicknamed the "prince of dribblers") set up the second goal with skillful dribbling[2]

This victory gave Oxford University their first FA Cup title, preventing Royal Engineers from winning in their third consecutive final appearance[1][2].
