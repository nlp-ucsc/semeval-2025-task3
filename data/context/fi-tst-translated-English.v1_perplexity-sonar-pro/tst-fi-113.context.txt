Based on the available search results, there is no direct mention of Germany occupying Mercy-le-Haut specifically. However, we can infer some relevant information:

1. Mercy-le-Haut is a commune in France, located in the Meurthe-et-Moselle department in the Grand Est region[5]. This region was part of the area affected by German occupation during World War II.

2. The search results indicate that Germany occupied parts of France during World War II, including the Alsace-Lorraine region, which is geographically close to Mercy-le-Haut[2][4].

3. The German occupation of France began in 1940 after the Armistice Agreement[2]. The occupation affected various parts of France, including regions near the German border.

4. Albert Lebrun, who was born in Mercy-le-Haut, served as the last president of France's Third Republic from 1932 to 1940[9]. His presidency ended with the fall of France to Nazi Germany in 1940, which suggests that the occupation likely affected his hometown as well.

While there is no explicit statement about the occupation of Mercy-le-Haut, it is highly probable that the town was under German control during World War II, given its location in northeastern France and the widespread nature of the German occupation in that region. However, without more specific historical records about Mercy-le-Haut during the war years, we cannot state this with absolute certainty.
