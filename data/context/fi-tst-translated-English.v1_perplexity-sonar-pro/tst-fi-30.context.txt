The models featured on the cover art of Black Sabbath's album "The Eternal Idol" experienced a concerning health issue due to the photoshoot. Here are the key details:

The album cover was based on Auguste Rodin's 1889 sculpture "The Eternal Idol"[3][5]. However, Black Sabbath could not obtain the rights to use an image of the original sculpture for their album cover[3][7].

As an alternative, the band decided to recreate the sculpture's pose using live models[3][7]. Two models were hired and painted with bronze paint to mimic the appearance of Rodin's bronze sculpture[5][7].

Unfortunately, this artistic decision had serious health consequences. The bronze paint used on the models turned out to be toxic[5][7]. As a result of their prolonged exposure to this toxic substance during the photoshoot, both models had to be hospitalized after the session was completed[5][7].

This incident echoes a similar situation from Black Sabbath's earlier days when drummer Bill Ward was painted gold for a photoshoot, which also led to medical issues[8]. Tony Iommi, Black Sabbath's guitarist, later reflected on the "Eternal Idol" cover shoot, saying: "They may well have ended up in hospital, because that's what had happened with Bill when we painted him. You just can't cover parts of the body up like that."[8]

While the exact nature and severity of the models' medical treatment are not specified in the available sources, the fact that hospitalization was required indicates the seriousness of the situation. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers involved in certain artistic practices, especially when toxic substances are used in close contact with the human body.
