There is no flower that grows directly on the root of a tooth. However, the query may be referring to a plant called "toothwort" that has some interesting connections to teeth and roots.

Toothwort (Cardamine spp.) is a spring-flowering woodland plant native to eastern North America[1][2]. It gets its name from the tooth-like projections on its underground stems or rhizomes, which resemble small teeth[6]. Some key facts about toothwort:

1. Appearance: Toothwort typically grows about 30 cm (12 inches) tall and has white or pale pink four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring[1][2].

2. Leaves: It has distinctive sharply toothed, deeply lobed leaves that grow in a whorl midway up the stem[2].

3. Root structure: The underground rhizomes have small tooth-like projections, giving the plant its common name[6].

4. Flowering period: Toothwort blooms for about 2 weeks in early spring, usually from March to May[3].

5. Habitat: It grows in rich wooded areas, slopes, and valleys[2].

6. Uses: Historically, some Native American tribes used toothwort for food and medicinal purposes. The roots are edible and have a spicy, radish-like flavor[3].

While toothwort doesn't actually grow on teeth, its name and appearance create an interesting connection to dental imagery. The tooth-like projections on its rhizomes and its use in traditional medicine make it a plant of interest in relation to teeth and roots.
