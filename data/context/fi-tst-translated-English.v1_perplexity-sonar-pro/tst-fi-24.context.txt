The Bantu-speaking peoples, specifically early Iron Age settlers, arrived in the Mapungubwe region around the 10th century CE[1][3]. These settlers were pastoralists who formed the kingdom of Mapungubwe[1]. 

Key details about the early settlers of Mapungubwe include:

1. They were early Iron Age settlers who lived in the area from about 1000 AD to 1300 AD[3].

2. Archaeological evidence shows a marked increase in the number of domesticated cattle in the area during the 10th century CE, indicating the presence of these pastoralist communities[1][2].

3. The settlers practiced agriculture, particularly cattle herding and the cultivation of crops like sorghum and cowpeas[1].

4. They were skilled in metalworking, as evidenced by their ability to manufacture pottery and metal tools[3].

5. Cotton cultivation and weaving were also introduced during this period, as indicated by the discovery of spindle whorls[2].

6. These early settlers were likely the ancestors of the Shona people of southern Africa[3].

7. The community initially settled at K2 (also known as Bambandyanalo) near Bambandyanalo Hill during the 11th century before expanding to nearby Mapungubwe Hill by 1220[4].

The arrival and settlement of these Bantu-speaking peoples in the Mapungubwe region marked the beginning of a significant era in southern African history, leading to the development of one of the region's first complex state societies.
