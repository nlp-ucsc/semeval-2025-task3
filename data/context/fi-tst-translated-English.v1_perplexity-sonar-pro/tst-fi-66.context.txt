Kyle Korver started his professional career with the Philadelphia 76ers in the 2003-04 NBA season[1][7]. 

While Korver was initially drafted by the New Jersey Nets with the 51st overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft, he was immediately traded to the Philadelphia 76ers[1][7]. This trade has an interesting backstory:

The Nets, who had just come off an Atlantic Division win and an NBA Finals appearance, were low on cash and had no preferred draft choices left. They selected Korver and immediately sold his draft rights to the 76ers for $125,000[7]. This amount reportedly covered the Nets' summer league costs and paid for a new copy machine[7]. This "traded for a copy machine" incident became a motivational story for Korver throughout his career[7].

As a rookie with the 76ers in the 2003-04 season, Korver averaged 4.5 points and 1.5 rebounds in 74 games[7]. He would go on to play for the 76ers until the 2007-08 season, spending a total of four and a half seasons with the team before being traded to the Utah Jazz[1][7].
