Altadena, California receives an average of 0 inches of snow per year[1][5]. This means that snowfall in Altadena is extremely rare and essentially non-existent in a typical year.

While Altadena itself doesn't experience regular snowfall, it's worth noting a few additional points about snow in the area:

1. Altadena is located at an elevation of about 1,300 feet above sea level, which occasionally allows for trace amounts of snow[3].

2. The community experiences trace amounts of snow (not measurable accumulation) about once every decade, and measurable amounts about once every two decades[3].

3. The surrounding San Gabriel Mountains in Los Angeles County do receive annual snowfall, particularly at higher elevations. Snow can be found as low as 3,000 feet in early December and typically remains only on the highest peaks by mid-April[3].

4. For comparison, the average annual snowfall in the United States is 28 inches, highlighting how unusually snow-free Altadena is compared to many other parts of the country[1].

5. Instead of snow, Altadena receives an average of 23 inches of rain per year, which is below the US average of 38 inches[1].

In summary, while Altadena itself averages 0 inches of snow annually, residents might occasionally see trace amounts of snow in rare weather events, and can experience snow by visiting nearby mountains during winter months.
