The Nintendo Classic Mini: Nintendo Entertainment System (NES Classic Edition) supports several controller options beyond the included NES Classic Controller[1]. Here are the compatible controllers:

1. Nintendo Classic Mini: Super Nintendo Entertainment System Controller (Model No. CLV-202)[1]

2. Nintendo Classic Mini: Nintendo Entertainment System Controller (Model No. CLV-002)[1]

3. Wii Classic Controller (Model No. RVL-005)[1]

4. Classic Controller Pro [Model No. RVL-005 (02)][1]

5. Wired Fight Pad by PDP[1]

6. Battle Pad by Hori[1]

It's important to note that the Wii Classic Controller, Classic Controller Pro, Wired Fight Pad, and Battle Pad can only be used as second controllers for 2-player games on the NES Classic Mini[1].

Additionally, some third-party manufacturers have created compatible controllers specifically for the NES Classic Mini. These include both wired and wireless options[9]. However, it's crucial to ensure compatibility before purchasing any third-party controllers.

For those looking to use original NES controllers, there are adapters available that allow you to connect original NES controllers to the NES Classic Mini[3].

It's worth mentioning that the controllers designed for the NES Classic Mini are not interchangeable with those released for the original Nintendo Entertainment System or the Nintendo Classic Mini: Nintendo Entertainment System[5]. 

Lastly, while not officially supported, some users have reported success using other controllers like the GameCube controller and even fight sticks with the NES Classic Mini[2]. However, these are not officially endorsed by Nintendo and may not work optimally for all games.
