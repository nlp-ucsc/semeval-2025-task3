19521 Chaos was originally known under the provisional designation 1998 WH24 before being officially named[1][3][5]. This provisional designation indicates that it was the 624th object discovered in the second half of November 1998.

Some key details about 19521 Chaos:

- It was discovered on November 19, 1998 by the Deep Ecliptic Survey using the 4-meter telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory[1][3][5].

- It is classified as a cubewano, which is a type of trans-Neptunian object (TNO) in the Kuiper belt that is not in orbital resonance with Neptune[3][5].

- Chaos is estimated to be about 560 km in diameter, making it one of the larger known TNOs[1][5].

- It has an orbital period of approximately 309 years[3][5].

- The object was named after Chaos from Greek mythology, representing the primordial state of existence from which the first gods emerged[1][3].

The transition from using its provisional designation (1998 WH24) to its official name (19521 Chaos) occurred after its orbit was sufficiently well-determined and a name was proposed and accepted by the International Astronomical Union's Committee on Small Body Nomenclature.
