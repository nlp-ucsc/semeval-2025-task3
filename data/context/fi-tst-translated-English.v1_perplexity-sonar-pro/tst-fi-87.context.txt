In Dan Brown's novel Inferno, Robert Langdon is a professor of Religious Iconology and Symbology at Harvard University[3][4]. Symbology is a fictional academic field created by Dan Brown for his Robert Langdon series of novels[4][7].

As a professor of Symbology, Langdon specializes in studying and interpreting symbols, icons, and their historical and religious significance. This fictional discipline combines elements of art history, religious studies, and semiotics[6]. Langdon's expertise in this field allows him to decipher complex puzzles and codes related to historical artifacts, artworks, and religious symbolism throughout the novel[5].

In Inferno specifically, Langdon uses his knowledge of symbology to interpret clues related to Dante Alighieri's epic poem "The Divine Comedy," particularly its first part "Inferno," as well as Renaissance art and architecture in Florence, Venice, and Istanbul[4][5]. His unique skillset in this fictional academic field is crucial for unraveling the mystery surrounding a potential global catastrophe in the novel[5].
