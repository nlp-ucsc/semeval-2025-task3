No, horse chestnuts do not produce an edible fruit. Horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) are toxic and should not be consumed by humans or animals[1][2][3]. Here are some key points about horse chestnuts and their inedibility:

1. Toxicity: Horse chestnuts contain poisonous compounds called saponins, which can cause serious gastrointestinal problems if ingested[1][3].

2. Symptoms of poisoning: Consuming horse chestnuts can lead to digestive disorders such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and throat irritation[2].

3. Distinction from edible chestnuts: Horse chestnuts are often confused with edible sweet chestnuts (Castanea sativa), but they belong to different plant families and have distinct characteristics[3][4].

4. Identification: 
   - Horse chestnut capsules are thick and green with short, widely spaced spikes, usually containing one large rounded nut[2].
   - Sweet chestnut capsules (called burrs) are brown with numerous long, bristly spines and contain 2-3 smaller, flattened, triangular nuts[2].

5. Tree location: Horse chestnut trees are commonly found in cities, parks, and schoolyards, while sweet chestnut trees typically grow in woods and forests[2].

6. Leaf shape: Horse chestnut leaves have a palm-shaped appearance with several oval leaflets, whereas sweet chestnut leaves are simple and elongated[2].

7. Non-human effects: Horse chestnuts are also toxic to various animals, including cattle, horses, sheep, and chickens. Interestingly, deer seem to be able to eat them without ill effects[1].

While horse chestnuts are not edible, they do have some medicinal and cosmetic uses. Extracts from horse chestnut fruit are used in treatments for varicose veins and venous insufficiency due to their anti-inflammatory and vein-strengthening properties[7]. However, it's crucial to note that any medicinal use should be under professional guidance, as the raw fruit remains toxic.
