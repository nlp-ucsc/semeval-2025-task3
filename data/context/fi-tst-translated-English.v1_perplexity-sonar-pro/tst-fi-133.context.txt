Clifford Glenwood Shull completed his undergraduate studies at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania[1][2][4][8][9]. He earned his Bachelor of Science (BS) degree from this institution in 1937[1][2][4][9].

Shull's decision to attend Carnegie Tech was influenced by several factors:

1. Proximity: As a Pittsburgh native, Shull could live at home and commute to the university, which was more financially feasible for his family[8].

2. Scholarship: He was offered a half-tuition scholarship due to his excellent high school record[8].

3. Reputation: Carnegie Tech offered reputable curricula in engineering and physical sciences[8].

During his time at Carnegie Tech, Shull's interest in physics deepened, particularly due to inspiring lectures by Harry Hower, the chairman of the Physics Department[8]. He also gained valuable laboratory experience working with Professor Emerson Pugh during his junior and senior years[6]. This undergraduate experience, combined with his strong academic performance, led Shull to pursue graduate studies in physics at New York University after completing his BS in 1937[8].
