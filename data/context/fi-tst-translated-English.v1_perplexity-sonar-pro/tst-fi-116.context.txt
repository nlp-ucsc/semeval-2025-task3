The Ukrainian karbovanets has been in use during several periods in the 20th century and early 21st century:

1. 1910s-1920s: The first karbovanets was introduced in December 1917 (January 1918 according to the Gregorian calendar) by the Ukrainian People's Republic[1][3]. It remained in use during the Ukrainian War of Independence until the early 1920s.

2. 1940s: During World War II, the German occupying government (Reichskommissariat Ukraine) issued a second version of the karbovanets, which was in circulation between 1942 and 1945[3][5].

3. 1990s-2000s: The third and most recent use of the karbovanets began in the early 1990s:

   - In November 1990, the Ukrainian SSR introduced one-time coupons called karbovanets[3].
   - On January 10, 1992, the karbovanets officially replaced the Soviet ruble as Ukraine's currency[2][3].
   - The karbovanets remained in use until September 1996, when it was replaced by the hryvnia due to hyperinflation[3][6].

During the transition period from September 2 to September 16, 1996, both the karbovanets and the hryvnia were in circulation[3]. After September 16, 1996, the use of the karbovanets as a national currency was discontinued[3].

In summary, the Ukrainian karbovanets has been used in the 1910s-1920s, 1940s, and 1990s-2000s decades.
