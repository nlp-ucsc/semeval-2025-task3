Before 2013, Yushu's administrative seat was Yushu County. In 2013, Yushu County was abolished and Yushu City was established in its place[2][4]. Specifically:

1. Prior to 2013, the area was administered as Yushu County, which was under the jurisdiction of Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture[2].

2. The county seat was located in the town of Gyêgu (also known as Yushu or Jiegu in Chinese), which served as the administrative center[4].

3. In 2013, as part of administrative changes, Yushu County was abolished and replaced by Yushu City, a county-level city[2][4].

4. The former administrative area of Yushu County became the administrative area of the newly established Yushu City[2].

5. Gyêgu town continued to serve as the seat of both Yushu Prefecture and the new Yushu City after this administrative change[2][4].

So in summary, before 2013, the administrative seat was Yushu County, centered in Gyêgu town. The 2013 change elevated the administrative status from county to city level, while maintaining the same general area and administrative center.
