Moshood Abiola did not become the president of Nigeria due to the annulment of the June 12, 1993 presidential election, which he was widely believed to have won. The reasons for this can be summarized as follows:

1. Military Intervention: The election results were annulled by the then military president, General Ibrahim Babangida, before they could be officially declared[3][5]. This military intervention prevented Abiola from assuming office despite his apparent victory.

2. Political Maneuvering: There were suggestions that the military leadership was uneasy about Abiola's potential presidency and would not accept the result if he won[5]. This indicates that there may have been behind-the-scenes political maneuvering to prevent Abiola from taking power.

3. Alleged Electoral Irregularities: General Babangida cited electoral irregularities, including vote buying, as reasons for annulling the election[5]. However, observers had declared the election to be the freest and fairest in Nigerian history[3].

4. Arrest and Detention: When Abiola attempted to claim the presidency based on the election results, he was arrested for treason in 1994 by the military regime led by General Sani Abacha[1][3]. This effectively prevented him from pursuing his claim to the presidency.

5. Continued Military Rule: Following the annulment, Nigeria continued under military rule. General Sani Abacha took power in a bloodless coup later in 1993, further cementing military control and preventing any civilian, including Abiola, from assuming the presidency[5].

6. Mysterious Death: Abiola died in custody on July 7, 1998, under suspicious circumstances, just as he was about to be released[1]. This occurred during a meeting with a U.S. delegation to discuss Nigeria's transition to democratic rule, effectively ending any possibility of him becoming president.

7. "Bad Belle" Factor: Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has suggested that "bad belle" (a colloquial term for jealousy or ill will) played a role in preventing Abiola from becoming president[2][4]. This implies that there were individuals or groups who, out of envy or malice, worked to obstruct Abiola's ascension to the presidency.

In conclusion, a combination of military intervention, political machinations, and tragic circumstances prevented Moshood Abiola from assuming the presidency of Nigeria, despite his apparent victory in what was considered a free and fair election[3][5]. His story remains a significant chapter in Nigeria's political history, highlighting the challenges faced in the country's journey towards democracy.
