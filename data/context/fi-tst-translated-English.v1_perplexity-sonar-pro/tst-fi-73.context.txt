Karen Percy won two bronze medals in alpine skiing at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary:

1. She won bronze in the women's downhill event on February 19, 1988[1][4].

2. She won bronze in the women's super-G (super-giant slalom) event on February 22, 1988[1][4].

These two bronze medals were especially impressive achievements considering Percy had undergone thumb surgery just four weeks before the Olympics[3]. As the home country favorite competing in Calgary, she was under additional pressure but still managed to deliver strong performances[1].

Percy's two bronze medals accounted for two of Canada's five total medals at their home Olympics[4]. She narrowly missed a third medal, finishing fourth in the women's combined event[1][3].

Her success at the 1988 Calgary Olympics made Percy a national hero in Canada and established her as one of the country's top alpine skiers of that era[1][3]. These Olympic medals were the highlight of a successful career that also included World Cup podium finishes and a silver medal at the 1989 World Championships[3].
