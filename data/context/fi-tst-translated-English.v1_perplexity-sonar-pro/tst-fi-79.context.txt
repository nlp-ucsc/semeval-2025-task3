The Southern black-backed gull (Larus dominicanus), also known as the Karoro in New Zealand, has a distinctive vocalization that can be described as follows:

The primary vocalization of the Southern black-backed gull is a long series of loud calls that sound like "ee-ah-ha-ha-ha"[9]. This vocalization is typically used in territorial and aggressive contexts, serving as a way for the gull to assert its presence or defend its territory.

Some key characteristics of the Southern black-backed gull's vocalizations include:

1. Loud and repetitive: The calls are generally quite loud and often repeated in a series, making them easily noticeable in coastal environments.

2. Varied contexts: While the "ee-ah-ha-ha-ha" call is common, the gull produces different vocalizations depending on the situation. For example:

   - Feeding calls: When in large flocks feeding in fields or near refuse tips, they produce a cacophony of various calls[9].
   - Breeding colony sounds: At nesting sites, the calls can become more intense and frequent as birds communicate with mates and defend nesting territories[9].
   - Anxiety calls: When disturbed or feeling threatened, they emit distinct anxiety calls, often while flying overhead[9].

3. Adult vocalizations: Mature birds produce a "yodel" along with other calls, particularly when near water bodies like lake edges[9].

It's worth noting that while the Southern black-backed gull has its own distinct vocalizations, its calls share some similarities with other large gull species. For instance, the Great black-backed gull (Larus marinus), a related species, also produces deep, hoarse calls that have been described as "swallowed-sounding"[5]. However, the Southern black-backed gull's calls are unique to its species and play a crucial role in its communication and behavior in its native habitats in the Southern Hemisphere.
