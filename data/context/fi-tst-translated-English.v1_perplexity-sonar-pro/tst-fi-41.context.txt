Darius I, also known as Darius the Great, died in 485 BCE[4][8][9]. He was the father of Xerxes I and ruled the Achaemenid Empire from 522 BCE until his death[8]. Upon Darius I's death in 485 BCE, his son Xerxes I succeeded him as the ruler of the Persian Empire[3][9].

Xerxes I, also called Xerxes the Great, was born around 519 BCE and began his reign in 486 BCE following his father's death[1][7]. He ruled the Persian Achaemenid Empire from 486 BCE until his assassination in 465 BCE[1][7].

Some key events following Darius I's death in 485 BCE include:

1. Xerxes I's ascension to the throne[3][9].
2. The destruction of Babylon by Xerxes I in the same year (485 BCE)[4].
3. Xerxes I's continuation of the war with Greece that his father had begun[9].
4. Extensive preparations for invading mainland Greece, including building depots, canals, and a boat bridge across the Hellespont in 480 BCE[4].

These events marked the beginning of Xerxes I's reign and set the stage for his famous, though ultimately unsuccessful, invasion of Greece in the following years.
