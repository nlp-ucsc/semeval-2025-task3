The discovery and identification of Omega Centauri as a globular cluster involved several astronomers over many centuries:

1. Ancient observation: Omega Centauri was first catalogued as a single star by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in his Almagest in the 2nd century CE[1][4].

2. Early modern designation: In 1603, German cartographer Johann Bayer designated it as "Omega Centauri" in his star atlas Uranometria, still considering it a single star[1][2].

3. First non-stellar identification: English astronomer Edmond Halley was the first to recognize Omega Centauri as a non-stellar object in 1677 while observing from the island of Saint Helena[1][2][4].

4. Nebula classification: In the 18th century, it was included in lists of nebulae by astronomers such as Jean-Philippe de Cheseaux (1746) and Nicolas Louis de Lacaille (1755)[1][2].

5. Globular cluster identification: Scottish astronomer James Dunlop was the first to correctly identify Omega Centauri as a globular cluster in 1826, describing it as a "beautiful globe of stars"[1][2].

6. Confirmation: English astronomer John Herschel observed Omega Centauri with a large telescope in the 1830s and confirmed its nature as a globular cluster[1][6].

While Edmond Halley is often credited with the discovery of Omega Centauri as a distinct astronomical object, James Dunlop is recognized for first identifying its true nature as a globular cluster. The understanding of Omega Centauri evolved over time, with contributions from multiple astronomers leading to its current classification.
