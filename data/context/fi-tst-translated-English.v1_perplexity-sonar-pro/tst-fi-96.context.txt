Damon Lindelof co-created the HBO supernatural drama series The Leftovers with Tom Perrotta[1][3]. The show is based on Perrotta's 2011 novel of the same name[3].

Lindelof served as the showrunner and executive producer for all three seasons of The Leftovers, which aired from 2014 to 2017[1]. He was also heavily involved in writing the series, penning 26 out of the 28 total episodes[1].

The Leftovers explores the lives of people in the aftermath of a mysterious event called the "Sudden Departure," where 2% of the world's population inexplicably vanished[2]. The series stars Justin Theroux, Amy Brenneman, and Carrie Coon[3].

Lindelof was drawn to the project after reading a positive review of Perrotta's novel by Stephen King. He appreciated how Perrotta used a supernatural premise to tell an emotional story about a family[3]. After HBO acquired the rights to the book, Lindelof pursued the opportunity to adapt it for television, ultimately partnering with Perrotta to bring The Leftovers to the screen[3].

The series received critical acclaim, particularly for its writing, directing, acting, and thematic depth. Many critics consider The Leftovers to be one of the greatest television series of all time[1]. Despite its critical success, the show maintained average viewership ratings throughout its run but has since developed a cult following[1][2].
