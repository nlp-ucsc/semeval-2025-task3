The history of the word "collage" is said to have begun in France. The term "collage" derives from the French word "coller," which means "to glue" or "to stick together"[1][2][4][8]. 

While the technique of collage itself can be traced back much further, the term and its popularization as an art form are attributed to the early 20th century, specifically to the Cubist movement in France. Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso are often credited with introducing and popularizing the term and technique in the art world around 1912[1][2][7].

Braque is frequently cited as the first to use the technique in modern art. He reportedly purchased a roll of simulated oak-grain wallpaper and began cutting out pieces to attach to his charcoal drawings[1]. This technique was initially called "papier coll√©" (literally "glued paper" in French)[1][7].

Picasso quickly adopted the technique after seeing Braque's work, and together they began experimenting with collage in their Cubist paintings[1][2]. Their use of collage was part of a methodical reexamination of the relationship between painting and sculpture, introducing fragments of externally referenced meaning into their artwork[1].

It's worth noting that while the term and its popularization in fine art began in early 20th century France, the technique of collage itself has much older roots, dating back to the invention of paper in China around 200 BC[1][4]. However, it was the French Cubists who brought the term and technique to prominence in the modern art world, cementing its place in art history.
