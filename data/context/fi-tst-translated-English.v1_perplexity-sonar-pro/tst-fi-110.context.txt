William S. Burroughs famously referred to John Waters as the "Pope of Trash"[7][8]. This nickname was given to Waters by Burroughs in recognition of Waters' provocative and transgressive cult films from the 1970s and 1980s[7]. Waters has embraced this title and often references it, considering it one of the best compliments he has ever received[7][8].

Waters has described receiving this nickname from Burroughs as "the best quote of my life" and likened it to "the pope himself coming down from heaven to give me the Imperial Margarine crown and James Brown's cloak"[7]. He has continued to use and celebrate this moniker throughout his career, even jokingly describing wearing a "Pope of Trash" outfit consisting of "a robe like the Cowardly Lion and trash where the fur is"[7].

This nickname aligns with Waters' reputation for making boundary-pushing, controversial films that often featured outrageous content and challenged societal norms. It reflects Burroughs' recognition of Waters as a kindred spirit in pushing artistic and cultural boundaries[8][10].
