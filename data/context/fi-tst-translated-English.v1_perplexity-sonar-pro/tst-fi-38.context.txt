According to the search results, in 2016 the Norwegian Baptist Union had 97 congregations[1]. This number comes from the Wikipedia article on the Baptist Union of Norway, which states that "The union has 97 congregations."

It's worth noting that the number of congregations has increased since then. By 2020, the Baptist Union of Norway had grown to 105 congregations[3]. This growth is largely attributed to the addition of migrant congregations joining the union since 2000.
