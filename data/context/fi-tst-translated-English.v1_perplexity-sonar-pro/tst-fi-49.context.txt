Speech disorders can be classified into several main categories:

1. Speech Sound Disorders
Speech sound disorders involve difficulties in producing specific speech sounds correctly. These can be further subdivided into:

- Articulation Disorders: Difficulty physically producing specific speech sounds[3][6].
- Phonological Disorders: Issues with understanding and using the sound system of language[6].
- Childhood Apraxia of Speech: Difficulty planning and coordinating the movements needed for speech[8].
- Dysarthria: Weakness or paralysis of speech muscles, often due to neurological conditions[2][8].

2. Fluency Disorders
These disorders affect the rhythm and flow of speech. The main types are:

- Stuttering: Characterized by repetitions, blocks, or prolongations of sounds or syllables[3][5][7].
- Cluttering: Rapid speech rate with irregular rhythm, making speech difficult to understand[2].

3. Voice Disorders
These involve abnormalities in the production of voice, including issues with:

- Pitch
- Loudness
- Quality
- Resonance[3][4]

4. Resonance Disorders
These affect the nasal quality of the voice, often due to improper airflow during speech[3].

5. Language Disorders
While distinct from speech disorders, language disorders can impact speech and are often considered in conjunction with speech disorders. They affect the understanding or use of spoken or written language[3][4].

6. Central Auditory Processing Disorders (CAPD)
These involve difficulties in processing auditory information in the central nervous system[1].

7. Orofacial Myofunctional Disorders (OMD)
These disorders affect the development and function of the muscles and bones in the mouth and face, impacting speech production[8].

8. Neurogenic Speech Disorders
These include conditions like aphasia, which can affect various aspects of speech and language due to brain damage[8].

9. Selective Mutism
A condition where a person is capable of speech but only speaks in certain situations, often related to anxiety[5][8].

These categories can overlap, and individuals may experience multiple types of speech disorders simultaneously. The classification helps in diagnosis and determining appropriate treatment approaches for each specific disorder[1][4].
