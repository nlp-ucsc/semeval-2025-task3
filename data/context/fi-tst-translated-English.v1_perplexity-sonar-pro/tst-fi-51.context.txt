Paris Metro Line 8 was first opened on July 13, 1913[1][2][6]. The initial section of the line connected Beaugrenelle station (now known as Charles Michels station on Line 10) to Opéra station[6].

Some key points about the opening and development of Line 8:

1. Initial section: The first stretch ran from Beaugrenelle to Opéra[1][2].

2. Quick extension: Shortly after its initial opening, on September 30, 1913, the line was extended from Beaugrenelle to Porte d'Auteuil[2][7].

3. Gradual expansion: Over the years, Line 8 underwent several extensions and modifications:
   - October 5, 1942: Extended eastbound from Porte de Charenton to Charenton - Écoles[2].
   - September 19, 1970: Extended from Charenton - Écoles to Maisons-Alfort - Stade[2].
   - April 27, 1972: Extended to Maisons-Alfort - Les Juilliottes[2].
   - September 24, 1973: Extended to Créteil - l'Echat[2].
   - September 9, 1974: Reached Créteil - Préfecture[2].

4. Current status: Today, Line 8 is one of the longest lines in the Paris Metro system, spanning over 23 km of track[7]. It now runs between Balard in the southwest and Créteil Pointe du Lac in the southeast[4].

5. Historical context: While Line 8 opened in 1913, it's worth noting that the very first Paris Metro line (Line 1) was inaugurated much earlier, on July 19, 1900, coinciding with the 1900 Summer Olympic Games[8].

Line 8 has thus been serving Parisians and visitors for over a century, evolving and expanding to meet the city's growing transportation needs.
