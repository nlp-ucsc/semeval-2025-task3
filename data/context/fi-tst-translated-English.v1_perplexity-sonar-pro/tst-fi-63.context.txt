Based on the available search results, there is limited specific information about the languages spoken in Dioumaténé. However, I can provide some relevant details about languages in the region:

Dioumaténé is a village and rural commune in the Cercle of Kadiolo in the Sikasso Region of southern Mali[4]. Given its location, we can infer some information about likely languages spoken there:

1. Shenara: The search results mention a Shenara language area in the Sikasso region, specifically in the cercle of Kadiolo[1]. This suggests that Shenara (also called Syenara or Shz) is likely one of the main languages spoken in Dioumaténé.

2. Bambara: The search results indicate that Bambara remains a foreign language for the Shenamana people[1]. However, as Bambara is widely spoken in Mali, it may still be used to some extent in Dioumaténé, particularly for inter-ethnic communication.

3. French: As the official language of Mali, French is likely to have some presence in Dioumaténé, especially in administrative or educational contexts.

4. Other Senufo languages: The Shenara language belongs to the Senufo language family[1]. Other Senufo languages or dialects might also be present in the area.

It's important to note that the language situation in Dioumaténé may be complex, with multiple languages or dialects used by different segments of the population. Without more specific data about Dioumaténé itself, it's difficult to provide a definitive ranking of the most common languages. A detailed sociolinguistic survey of the village would be necessary to determine the exact language composition and usage patterns.
