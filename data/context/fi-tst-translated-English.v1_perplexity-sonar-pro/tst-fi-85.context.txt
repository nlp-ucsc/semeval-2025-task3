Garajonay National Park is named after two sources:

1. The rock formation of Garajonay: This is the highest point on the island of La Gomera, reaching an elevation of 1,487 meters (4,879 feet)[2][9].

2. The legend of Gara and Jonay: This is a tragic love story from Guanche folklore that predates the Spanish conquest of the Canary Islands[1][3][6][9]. The legend tells of two young lovers:

   - Gara: A princess from Agulo on the island of La Gomera
   - Jonay: A prince from Adeje on the neighboring island of Tenerife

According to the legend, Gara and Jonay fell in love, but their union was forbidden due to an ominous sign - the eruption of the Teide volcano on Tenerife during their engagement announcement. Despite being separated, Jonay swam back to La Gomera to be with Gara. Pursued by their families, the lovers fled to the highest mountain on the island. There, rather than be separated, they chose to end their lives together[1][2][6].

This poignant tale of star-crossed lovers has been passed down through generations, and the mountain where they made their final stand now bears their combined names: Garajonay[1]. The legend not only gave the national park its name but also captures the spirit of the area, where nature and human history are deeply intertwined[1].
