The pharaohs of ancient Egypt did not belong to a specific tribe in the traditional sense. Rather, they were part of a complex dynastic system that ruled over a unified Egyptian state. Here's a more detailed explanation:

Pharaohs belonged to royal dynasties that ruled Egypt for long periods. These dynasties were not tribal in nature, but rather familial and political[1]. The era of the pharaohs began around 3000 B.C.E. when Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt were united under a single ruler[1].

The first pharaoh is traditionally believed to be Menes (also known as Narmer), who is credited with unifying Upper and Lower Egypt around 3100 B.C.E.[4] However, it's important to note that the exact identity of the first pharaoh is still debated among historians.

Pharaohs were typically born into their role, inheriting the position from their predecessors within the same dynasty[1]. If a pharaoh did not have an heir, a new pharaoh would be selected from a powerful wealthy family[1]. This system of succession continued throughout ancient Egyptian history, with various dynasties rising and falling over time.

The pharaohs were considered divine beings, acting as intermediaries between the gods and the people[5]. During the Old Kingdom period (c. 2686-2181 B.C.E.), pharaohs were even considered gods themselves[1].

It's crucial to understand that the concept of "tribe" as we understand it today doesn't accurately describe the social and political structure of ancient Egypt. The Egyptian state was a complex, centralized monarchy with a strict hierarchical structure, with the pharaoh at the top[6].

In terms of ethnicity, the origins and racial identity of the ancient Egyptians, including the pharaohs, have been subjects of scholarly debate. Modern research suggests that ancient Egyptian population was diverse and changed over time due to various factors including migration and conquest[2]. The ancient Egyptians themselves did not categorize people based on physical features in the same way modern racial categories do[2].

In conclusion, while pharaohs didn't belong to a specific "tribe," they were part of a complex dynastic system that ruled over a unified Egyptian state for thousands of years, with their authority derived from both political power and divine status in Egyptian religion and culture.
