Simón Bolívar y Palacios, commonly known as Simón Bolívar, was the first president of Colombia, serving from 1819 to 1830[1][2]. Born on July 24, 1783, Bolívar was a Venezuelan military and political leader who played a crucial role in the establishment of several South American countries, including Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia[1].

Bolívar's presidency began following the Congress of Angostura, where he was chosen as the interim executive officer and given the title of president[3]. He was subsequently re-elected by the Angostura Assembly on December 17, 1819, after Colombia gained independence following the Battle of Boyacá[3]. In 1821, Bolívar was elected again by the Congress of Cúcuta on a permanent interim basis, pending national elections[3].

During his presidency, Bolívar faced numerous challenges as he worked to consolidate the newly independent nation. From 1821 to 1826, while Bolívar was away fighting to liberate other Spanish colonies in Bolivia and Peru, the executive power was entrusted to Vice President Francisco de Paula Santander y Omaña[3].

Bolívar was formally elected in a national election in 1826 for a four-year term. However, on August 27, 1828, he declared martial law and assumed dictatorial powers after the Congress of Ocaña failed to pass a new constitution[3]. Eventually, Bolívar relinquished power in 1830, marking the end of his presidency[3].

It's worth noting that the Colombia of Bolívar's time, often referred to as Gran Colombia, included the territories of present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama[3]. This entity existed from 1819 to 1831, after which it dissolved into separate countries.
