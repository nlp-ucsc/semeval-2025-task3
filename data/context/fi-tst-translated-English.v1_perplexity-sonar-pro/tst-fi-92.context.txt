Herman Frazier is an Olympic champion in track and field, specifically in the 4x400 meter relay[1][2]. At the 1976 Montreal Olympics, Frazier ran the first leg for the gold medal-winning 4x400 meter relay team[1][3]. In addition to his gold medal in the relay, Frazier also won an individual bronze medal in the 400-meter dash at the same Olympics[1][3].

Frazier's athletic achievements extend beyond the Olympics. He was an eight-time All-American in track at Arizona State University[2]. He also won gold medals in the 4x400 meter relay at the Pan American Games in both 1975 and 1979[1].

His success in track and field laid the foundation for a long and distinguished career in athletics administration. After his competitive career, Frazier held various positions in university athletic departments and served on multiple U.S. Olympic committees, including as Chef de Mission for the U.S. delegation at the 2004 Athens Olympics[2].
