Richard Layard, a prominent economist and advocate for happiness economics, generally supports progressive income taxation as part of his broader views on economic policy and societal wellbeing. Here are the key points about Layard's perspective on progressive taxation:

1. Correcting for negative externalities: Layard argues that progressive taxation can help correct for the negative externalities created by income inequality and social comparisons[4]. He believes that as people earn more, they tend to compare themselves to others, leading to a "rat race" effect that doesn't increase overall happiness.

2. Maximizing societal happiness: Layard's fundamental belief is that the goal of government policy should be to maximize the happiness and wellbeing of citizens, rather than just economic growth[2]. He sees progressive taxation as a tool to achieve this goal by redistributing income in a way that can increase overall societal happiness.

3. Addressing diminishing marginal utility of income: While not explicitly stated in the given search results, Layard's work on happiness economics implies support for progressive taxation based on the principle of diminishing marginal utility of income. This concept suggests that additional income provides less happiness benefit to high earners compared to low earners[5].

4. Balancing incentives and fairness: Layard recognizes the need to balance the incentive effects of taxation with considerations of fairness. He acknowledges that excessively high tax rates could discourage work effort, but argues that moderate progressivity can still maintain incentives while promoting a fairer distribution of income[1][4].

5. Supporting public services: Layard believes that progressive taxation can help fund important public services and social programs that contribute to overall wellbeing. He has advocated for using tax revenue to support areas such as mental health services, education, and other initiatives that can improve quality of life[8].

6. Addressing inequality: Layard's work on unemployment and skills development suggests that he sees progressive taxation as part of a broader strategy to address inequality. By redistributing income through the tax system, it can help support programs that improve skills and employment opportunities for disadvantaged groups[8].

7. Consumption taxes: While much of Layard's work focuses on income taxation, he has also shown interest in progressive consumption taxes as a potential alternative or complement to income taxes. This approach would tax spending rather than earning, potentially encouraging saving and investment while still maintaining progressivity[3].

In summary, Richard Layard's support for progressive income taxation is rooted in his broader economic philosophy that emphasizes maximizing societal wellbeing over pure economic growth. He sees progressive taxation as a tool to address inequality, fund important public services, and correct for the negative externalities associated with income disparities, all while balancing these goals with the need to maintain economic incentives.
