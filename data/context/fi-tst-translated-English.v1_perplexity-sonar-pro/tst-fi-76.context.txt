Fredrikstad FK plays their home matches at Fredrikstad Stadion, also known as Nye Fredrikstad Stadion[1][3]. This stadium is located on the shore of the island Kråkerøy, just south of the city center of Fredrikstad, Norway[1].

Some key details about Fredrikstad Stadion:

- Capacity: The stadium has a capacity of 12,500-12,565 seats[1][3][4].
- Opening: It opened in 2007, replacing the old Fredrikstad Stadion which had been the club's home from 1914 to 2006[3][4].
- Surface: The playing surface is synthetic[1].
- Unique architecture: The stadium incorporates parts of old shipyard buildings in its design. The frontage replicates the original halls of a former workshop, making it architecturally unique[3].
- Location: It is situated in an area that was formerly a large shipyard, known locally as Værste or FMV. This area has now become the technological center of the city[3].
- Address: The stadium's address is K. G. Meldahls vei 9, Kråkerøy, 1671 Fredrikstad[4].

The stadium has hosted various events beyond regular league matches, including concerts and international under-21 football matches[3]. It's worth noting that the move to this new stadium was part of Fredrikstad FK's modernization efforts, as the facilities at their old ground had become outdated[5].
