The last four songs on Dire Straits' album "Brothers in Arms" focus on specific themes and events, particularly related to militarism and war. Here's a breakdown of these songs:

1. "Ride Across the River"
This song uses immersive Latin American imagery to allude to elements of guerilla warfare[7]. It features synthesized pan flute, mariachi trumpet, and a reggae-influenced drum part, creating an atmospheric soundscape that evokes the setting of conflict in a tropical environment[7].

2. "The Man's Too Strong"
This track depicts the character of an ancient soldier or war criminal[7]. It explores the theme of emotional repression, focusing on the character's fear of showing feelings as a weakness[7]. The song delves into the psychological impact of warfare on individuals.

3. "One World"
While not explicitly mentioned in the search results as focusing on militarism, this song likely continues the album's thematic exploration of global issues and human connections.

4. "Brothers in Arms"
The title track of the album is perhaps the most significant in terms of its focus on war:

- It was written during the 1982 Falklands War between the United Kingdom and Argentina[4][6].
- The song deals with the senselessness of war[7].
- It's sung from the perspective of a dying soldier on the battlefield[4].
- The lyrics touch on themes of comradery among soldiers, criticism of war-mongering, and the futility of conflict[4].
- While inspired by the Falklands War, Knopfler intentionally kept specifics out of the narrative to make it a timeless commentary on war[4].

The song "Brothers in Arms" has become particularly notable for its poignant anti-war message. It explores the bond between soldiers ("brothers in arms") while questioning the very conflicts that bring them together[1][2]. The lyrics touch on the shared humanity of all people, regardless of which side they fight on, with lines like "We're fools to make war on our brothers in arms"[4].

These songs, especially "Brothers in Arms," have resonated deeply with audiences and have been used in various media to underscore themes of conflict, camaraderie, and the human cost of war[10].
