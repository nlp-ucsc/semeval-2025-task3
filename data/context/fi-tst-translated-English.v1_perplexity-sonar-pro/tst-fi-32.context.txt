Based on the search results provided, there is no specific information about the administrative center of Western Athens. However, I can provide some relevant context about the administrative structure of Athens and its surrounding areas:

Western Athens is one of the regional units that make up the Athens Urban Area or Greater Athens[2]. It is part of the larger Attica region, which encompasses the entire Athens metropolitan area[1].

The Athens Urban Area consists of 40 municipalities divided into five regional units: Central Athens, North Athens, West Athens, South Athens, and Piraeus[2]. West Athens specifically spans about 66.7 square kilometers and includes several municipalities[8].

While the exact administrative center for Western Athens is not mentioned, it's important to note that Athens as a whole serves as the administrative center for the broader Attica region[1]. The Municipality of Athens, which is part of Central Athens, acts as the core of the urban area and is the largest municipality in terms of population[2].

For local administrative matters, Greek cities typically have Citizen Service Centres and town halls[7]. These offices handle various administrative tasks for residents. However, without more specific information, I cannot definitively state which particular office or location serves as the administrative center for Western Athens.

If you need to conduct official business or find the main administrative office for Western Athens, it would be best to contact one of the municipalities within the West Athens regional unit directly for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
