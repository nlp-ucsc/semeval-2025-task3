Yes, exotic birds and reptiles are commonly sold in many pet stores. Here are some key details about the sale of exotic birds and reptiles in pet stores:

Exotic Birds:
Many pet stores specialize in selling exotic birds ranging from smaller species like cockatiels to larger parrots like macaws[1]. For example, Omar's Exotic Birds has been selling parrots and other exotic bird species since 1984. They allow customers to interact with the birds before purchase to ensure a good match[1].

Reptiles:
Reptiles are also frequently sold in pet stores, including:
- Snakes (e.g. ball pythons, corn snakes)
- Lizards (e.g. bearded dragons, leopard geckos)
- Turtles and tortoises[2][4]

Many stores offer a wide variety of reptile species. For instance, Imperial Reptiles & Exotics sells snakes, lizards, geckos, and turtles online and ships them nationwide[5].

Additional Points:
- Pet stores often sell supplies and accessories for exotic pets alongside the animals themselves[5].
- Some stores specialize exclusively in reptiles or birds, while others offer a broader range of exotic pets[2][4].
- The sale of certain exotic species may be regulated differently than common pets like cats and dogs[3].
- There is debate around the ethics of selling exotic animals in pet stores, with some animal welfare organizations opposing the practice[6].

It's important to note that while exotic birds and reptiles are available in many pet stores, potential owners should research the specific care requirements and legality of owning these animals in their area before purchasing.
