Air France Flight 296 is known for being a tragic demonstration flight that ended in disaster on June 26, 1988[1][4]. This flight is significant for several reasons:

1. First fatal crash of an Airbus A320: This accident marked the first fatal crash involving the then-new Airbus A320 aircraft, which had only recently been introduced into commercial service[1][4].

2. Demonstration flight gone wrong: The flight was intended to be a showcase of the new A320's capabilities at an air show at Mulhouseâ€“Habsheim Airport in France[1][3]. It was the aircraft's first passenger flight, carrying mostly journalists and competition winners[4].

3. Low-altitude flyover accident: The plane was supposed to perform a low-speed flyover at 100 feet (33 meters) altitude. However, it descended much lower to about 30-35 feet, causing it to crash into trees at the end of the runway[1][3].

4. Controversial aftermath: The accident led to disputes between the pilots and investigators regarding the cause. The official report blamed pilot error, while the captain claimed there was an issue with the aircraft's fly-by-wire computer system[4].

5. Legal consequences: Five individuals, including the captain and first officer, were found guilty of involuntary manslaughter. The captain, Michel Asseline, served prison time and probation[4].

6. Safety implications: The crash raised questions about the safety of fly-by-wire systems and led to changes in aviation safety regulations[5].

7. Survival aspects: While the initial impact was survived by all 136 people on board, three passengers tragically died due to smoke inhalation in the subsequent fire[4].

This accident remains a significant case study in aviation history, highlighting the risks of air show demonstrations and the complexities of introducing new aircraft technologies.
