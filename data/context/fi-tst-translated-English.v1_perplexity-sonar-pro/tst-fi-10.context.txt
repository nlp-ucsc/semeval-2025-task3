The BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor was first presented at the 2010 ceremony[1]. This award category, along with Best Supporting Actress, was introduced as a new addition to the BAFTA Film Awards that year. Prior to 2010, BAFTA did not have separate categories specifically recognizing supporting performances in films.

Some additional context:

- The British Academy Film Awards, presented by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), have been awarded since 1949[3].

- For many years, BAFTA only recognized leading performances in the acting categories.

- The introduction of supporting actor/actress categories in 2010 brought the BAFTA Film Awards more in line with other major film awards like the Oscars, which have long had supporting acting categories.

- The first recipient of the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor in 2010 was Christoph Waltz for his performance in "Inglourious Basterds"[4].

This addition of supporting acting categories allowed BAFTA to recognize a broader range of performances and align more closely with other major film awards in its recognition of acting talent.
