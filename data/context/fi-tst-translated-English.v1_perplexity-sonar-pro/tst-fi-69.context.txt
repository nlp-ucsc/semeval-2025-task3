Lu Lin won Olympic gold in Barcelona 1992 in the men's doubles table tennis event, partnering with Wang Tao[1][4][5]. They defeated the German team of Steffen Fetzner and Jörg Roßkopf in the final to claim the gold medal[6].

This victory was part of a strong performance by the Chinese table tennis team at the 1992 Olympics. In addition to Lu and Wang's gold in men's doubles, Deng Yaping and Qiao Hong won gold in the women's doubles event[1][5].

Interestingly, Lu Lin and Wang Tao's journey to the gold medal match had a bit of drama. They almost missed their final due to transportation issues. When their bus from the Olympic Village failed to arrive, they began running to the venue in a panic before finally hailing a taxi to get there just in time[1].

Four years later, at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Lu Lin and Wang Tao teamed up again in the men's doubles event, where they won the silver medal[4].
