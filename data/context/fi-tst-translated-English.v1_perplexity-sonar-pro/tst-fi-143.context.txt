Publius Quinctilius Varus died by suicide during the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD[1][4]. As the Roman forces under his command were being overwhelmed by the Germanic tribes led by Arminius, Varus realized that defeat was inevitable and chose to take his own life rather than face capture or disgrace[1][4].

Specifically, Varus fell on his sword, a common method of suicide for Roman military leaders facing defeat[1]. This act was seen as an honorable way for a Roman commander to die rather than be captured by the enemy.

The battle lasted for several days, with the Roman legions being ambushed and gradually worn down by the Germanic forces[5]. By the third or fourth day of fighting, as the situation became hopeless for the Romans, Varus made the decision to end his life[8]. 

After Varus's death, his head was cut off by Arminius and sent to Bohemia as a gift to King Marbod of the Marcomanni, another powerful Germanic leader[1]. Marbod, however, declined Arminius's offer of an alliance and instead sent Varus's head to Rome for burial[1].

Varus's suicide was consistent with Roman military customs of the time. Faced with certain defeat and possible capture, many Roman commanders chose suicide as a way to maintain their honor and avoid the shame of surrender or execution by the enemy[7].
