The founding of the Jomsvikings is attributed to different figures in various sources, but the two most prominent candidates are:

1. Palnatoke (also known as Palnatoki or Pálnatóki): According to the Jómsvíkinga saga, Palnatoke was the founder of the Jomsvikings[1][4]. He was a legendary Danish hero and chieftain from the island of Fyn who established the Viking colony of Jomsborg[1]. The saga states that Palnatoke received land from the Wendish king to build the fortress of Jomsborg, which became the headquarters of the Jomsvikings[2][3].

2. Harald Bluetooth: Some sources attribute the founding of the Jomsvikings to Harald Bluetooth, the King of Denmark[3][6]. According to these accounts, Harald Bluetooth established and patronized the brotherhood, granting its leadership to Palnatoke and supplying them with their first fleet of longships[6].

It's worth noting that historical accounts vary, and some sources present a combination of these origin stories. For example:

- The Knýtlinga saga agrees that Harald Bluetooth founded the Jomsvikings, but doesn't connect the story of Styrbjörn (another figure associated with the Jomsvikings) to their founding[2].

- Some accounts suggest that Harald Bluetooth initially founded the settlement, which was then conquered and developed into the Jomsviking stronghold by others[2].

Given the legendary nature of the Jomsvikings and the lack of contemporary primary sources, historians continue to debate the accuracy of these founding stories[2][5]. The exact origins of the Jomsvikings remain a topic of discussion among historians and mythologists[5].
