The Helgoland-class battleships represented a significant improvement over the preceding Nassau-class in several key areas:

1. Main armament: The Helgoland-class ships were equipped with larger 30.5 cm (12-inch) guns compared to the 28 cm (11-inch) guns of the Nassau-class[1][5]. This upgrade in caliber provided greater firepower and range.

2. Size and displacement: The Helgoland-class ships were considerably larger than their predecessors. They were longer at 167.2 m (548 ft 7 in) overall compared to 146.1 m (479 ft 4 in) for the Nassau-class[1][4]. The Helgoland-class also had a larger beam of 28.5 m (93 ft 6 in) versus 26.9 m (88 ft 3 in) for the Nassau-class[1]. In terms of displacement, the Helgoland-class ships were significantly heavier at 22,808 tonnes standard and 24,700 tonnes fully loaded, compared to the Nassau-class at 18,873 tonnes standard and 20,535 tonnes fully loaded[1][4].

3. Power and speed: The Helgoland-class ships had more powerful engines, producing 27,617 ihp (20,594 kW) compared to the Nassau-class's 22,000 ihp. This resulted in a slightly higher top speed of 20.5 knots for the Helgoland-class versus 19 knots for the Nassau-class[1][2].

4. Range: The Helgoland-class ships had an improved range of 5,500 nautical miles at 10 knots, compared to 4,700 nautical miles at 16 knots for the Nassau-class[1][4].

5. Secondary armament: The Helgoland-class featured an increased number of secondary guns with 14 x 15cm guns compared to 12 x 15cm guns on the Nassau-class[2][4].

6. Hull design and seakeeping: The Helgoland-class ships were considered better sea boats than the Nassau-class. They were better balanced and avoided the severe rolling of their predecessors. Their hull shapes were revised, as well as the rudder and counter-keels, to make them more responsive to the helm, with a tighter turning radius and less speed loss in hard turns and swells[1].

7. Armor protection: While the general armor scheme was similar, the Helgoland-class had slight increases in thickness for the main and secondary batteries, and a far better roof for the forward conning tower[1].

8. Funnels: The Helgoland-class ships had three grouped funnels, compared to the two funnels of the Nassau-class, which was a result of internal rearrangements[1][5].

These improvements made the Helgoland-class more powerful, better protected, and more capable vessels than their Nassau-class predecessors, representing a significant step forward in German battleship design.
