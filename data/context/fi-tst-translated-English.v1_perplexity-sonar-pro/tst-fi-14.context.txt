Cornelius Vermuyden, a Dutch engineer, was hired to drain the Fens in England in the middle of the 17th century[1][3][4]. 

Born in 1595 on the Isle of Tholen in the Netherlands, Vermuyden trained as a land drainage engineer and learned Dutch techniques for controlling water and draining marshlands[1][4]. He was initially employed by King Charles I in 1626 to drain Hatfield Chase in Yorkshire[3]. 

In 1630, Vermuyden contracted to drain the Great Fens, also known as the Bedford Level, in Cambridgeshire[3]. However, his involvement in this initial phase has been debated, with some sources suggesting he only became actively involved in the second phase of construction in the 1650s[4][8].

Vermuyden introduced several innovations to the drainage scheme, including:

1. The construction of washes - areas of land allowed to flood during periods of bad weather to absorb excess water[4][7].
2. A proposal for a catchdrain around the eastern edge of the fen (though this was not implemented until the 1960s)[4].
3. The straightening and widening of rivers, such as the River Nene[4].
4. The creation of new channels, like the Old and New Bedford Rivers, to help water flow more quickly to the sea[5].

Despite initial successes, Vermuyden's techniques faced challenges due to the unique peatland ecology of the Fens. Draining caused the peat to shrink, lowering the land surface and making the area susceptible to flooding[3]. This led to ongoing drainage efforts and adaptations in the following centuries.

Vermuyden's work in England was not without controversy. He faced opposition from local fenmen who relied on the wetlands for their livelihoods and resented the influx of Dutch workers[1][8]. Despite these challenges, Vermuyden's efforts significantly transformed the Fenland landscape and laid the groundwork for future drainage projects in the region.
