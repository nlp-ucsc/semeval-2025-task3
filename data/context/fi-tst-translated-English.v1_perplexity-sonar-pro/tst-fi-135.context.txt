The extinction of the Puerto Rican hutia (Isolobodon portoricensis) is primarily attributed to European colonization and its associated impacts. Here are the key factors that contributed to its extinction:

1. European arrival and hunting: Christopher Columbus and his crew are believed to have eaten the species upon their arrival[4]. This marks the beginning of increased hunting pressure from European colonists.

2. Habitat destruction: European colonization led to large-scale deforestation and landscape transformation, which likely destroyed much of the hutia's natural habitat[5].

3. Introduction of invasive species: The early introduction of black rats (Rattus rattus) by the first European settlers around 1500 posed a significant threat to the Puerto Rican hutia[4]. Additionally, other introduced mammals like dogs, cats, rabbits, and mice may have competed with or preyed upon the hutia[2].

4. Possible impact of the small Indian mongoose: Some researchers suggest that the introduced small Indian mongoose (Urva auropunctata) in the 19th or early 20th century may have delivered the final blow to any remaining hutia populations[4].

5. Overhunting by indigenous people: While not the primary cause, it's worth noting that the Ta√≠no people also hunted the hutia as a vital food source for many years before European arrival[4].

The exact timing of the Puerto Rican hutia's extinction is uncertain. While it's commonly regarded as extinct, some researchers hold out hope that the species might still survive in undisturbed refuges[4]. However, the last confirmed evidence of its existence dates back to the early colonial period.

It's important to note that the Puerto Rican hutia's extinction was part of a larger pattern of mammalian extinctions in the Caribbean. The insular Caribbean experienced more mammal extinctions than any other global region during the Holocene, with European colonization appearing to be the main cause of decline for many species[1][5].
