Christina Ricci played the character Fegele Abramovich (later known as Suzie) in the film The Man Who Cried[1][2]. The story follows Fegele, a Russian Jewish girl who is separated from her father in 1927 and escapes to England[2]. As a child, Fegele was portrayed by Claudia Lander-Duke[4]. After arriving in England, she is renamed "Suzie" and grows up to become a singer, played by Christina Ricci as an adult[2][5]. The film, directed by Sally Potter, chronicles Suzie's journey from Russia to England and later to Paris, where she works in a variety show and falls in love with a Romani horseman named Cesar, played by Johnny Depp[6].
