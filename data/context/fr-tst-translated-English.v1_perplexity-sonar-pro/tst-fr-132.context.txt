Hugh Fraser plays Captain Arthur Hastings in the television series "Agatha Christie's Poirot" from 1989 to 2002[1][2][4]. He appeared in 43 episodes of the series during this period, starring alongside David Suchet who portrayed Hercule Poirot[3][4].

Fraser's portrayal of Captain Hastings was a significant part of the show, appearing in all episodes from 1989 to 2002, even in adaptations of stories where the character was not originally present in Christie's novels[6]. His role as Hastings represented the traditional English gentleman and served as Poirot's friend and assistant, often helping with physical tasks and providing a contrast to Poirot's more analytical approach[6].

After 2002, Fraser briefly returned to the role in 2013 for two episodes of the thirteenth and final season of the series[6]. Throughout his time on the show, Fraser's performance as Captain Hastings endeared him to mystery fans worldwide and became one of his most recognizable roles[3][4].
