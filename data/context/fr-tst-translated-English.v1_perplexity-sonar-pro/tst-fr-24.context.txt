The Steinway Tower, also known as 111 West 57th Street, contains 60 apartments in total[1][2]. These luxury residences range from studio apartments to multi-level penthouses, with prices starting at $7.75 million for a studio and going up to $66 million for the penthouse[1][3]. 

The building's unique design incorporates both new construction and the renovation of the historic Steinway Hall. Specifically:

1. The new tower portion houses 46 full-floor and duplex residences[3].

2. The remaining 14 residences are located within the renovated Steinway Hall building[3].

This ultra-luxury skyscraper is notable not just for its limited number of exclusive residences, but also for its remarkable slenderness. With a height-to-width ratio of 24:1, it's considered the world's skinniest skyscraper[2][4]. Despite its slim profile, the building stands at an impressive 1,428 feet (435 meters) tall, making it the third tallest building in New York City[2].
