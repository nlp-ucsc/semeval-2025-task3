The Emerging Church movement originated in the late 1990s and early 2000s with several key pastors and leaders. Some of the most prominent figures associated with the origins of the Emerging Church include:

Brian McLaren is widely considered one of the founding figures and most influential leaders of the Emerging Church movement[1][8]. As a pastor, author, and speaker, McLaren helped spark early conversations about reimagining Christianity for a postmodern context. He was involved in the formation of Emergent Village, a key organization in the movement[7].

Doug Pagitt was another central figure in the early days of the Emerging Church. He worked with Leadership Network to organize young leaders and pastors interested in new approaches to ministry[2][7]. Pagitt went on to plant Solomon's Porch, an experimental church community in Minneapolis[4].

Tony Jones was closely involved with Pagitt and McLaren in forming Emergent Village and shaping early Emerging Church theology and practice[2][4]. He served as the national coordinator for Emergent Village.

Dan Kimball was an influential early voice, writing books on ministry in emerging culture and pastoring Vintage Faith Church in California[1][7]. 

Mark Driscoll was initially associated with the movement in its early stages, though he later distanced himself and became critical of its theological direction[2][7].

Rob Bell gained prominence as a pastor and author exploring new ways of communicating Christian faith to younger generations[5][10]. His Mars Hill Bible Church became an influential model.

Chris Seay was part of the initial team organized by Leadership Network to explore ministry to younger generations[10].

Spencer Burke created TheOoze.com, an early online hub for Emerging Church conversations[10].

While not exhaustive, this list highlights several of the key pastoral figures who were instrumental in the origins and early development of the Emerging Church movement in the late 1990s and early 2000s. These leaders helped spark conversations about contextualizing Christianity for postmodern culture that came to define the movement.
