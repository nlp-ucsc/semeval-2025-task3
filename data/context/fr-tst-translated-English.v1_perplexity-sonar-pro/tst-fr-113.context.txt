According to Aristotle, happiness (eudaimonia) is not a fleeting state or a temporary feeling, but rather a lifelong pursuit and achievement. Aristotle considers happiness to be the ultimate goal of human life, but it is not something that can be attained in a short period or at a specific moment[1][2].

Key points about Aristotle's view on the period of happiness:

1. Lifelong process: Aristotle believed that true happiness could only be evaluated at the end of one's life. He saw it as the culmination of a life well-lived, rather than a temporary state[2].

2. Continuous activity: Happiness, for Aristotle, is not a passive state but an active engagement in virtuous activities throughout one's life[1].

3. Requires time and maturity: Aristotle argued that happiness takes time to develop. It involves cultivating virtues, gaining wisdom, and establishing meaningful relationships, all of which require time and experience[3].

4. Not limited to youth: Unlike pleasure-based concepts of happiness, Aristotle's eudaimonia is not confined to the exuberance of youth. It can be achieved and deepened as one ages and gains more wisdom and virtue[1].

5. Stability and durability: Aristotle emphasized that true happiness is stable and enduring. It's not subject to the fluctuations of fortune or fleeting pleasures but is a consistent state achieved through virtuous living[1][2].

6. Fulfillment of potential: Happiness, in Aristotelian terms, is about realizing one's full potential as a human being. This is an ongoing process that spans one's entire life[1].

7. Contemplative life: In his later writings, Aristotle particularly emphasized the importance of the contemplative life, suggesting that the highest form of happiness might be achieved in the later stages of life when one has more time for philosophical reflection[5].

In essence, Aristotle viewed happiness not as a period of life, but as the quality of a life in its entirety. It's the product of living virtuously, engaging in meaningful activities, and cultivating wisdom throughout one's lifetime. This perspective encourages a long-term view of happiness, focusing on sustained well-being and fulfillment rather than momentary pleasures or achievements.
