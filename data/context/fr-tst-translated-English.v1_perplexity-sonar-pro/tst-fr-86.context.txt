Between 1929 and 1935, Liu Wenhui primarily directed the following:

1. Sichuan Provincial Government: Liu Wenhui served as the Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government from 1928 to 1935[1][10]. This was a key leadership position overseeing the administration of Sichuan province.

2. 24th Army: Liu continued to command the 24th Army during this period, a position he had held since 1926[10]. The 24th Army was part of the National Revolutionary Army.

3. Sichuan-Xikang Defence: In 1932, Liu became the Commanding Officer of the Sichuan-Xikang Border Defence Command[10]. This role involved overseeing military operations and security in the border region between Sichuan and Xikang provinces.

4. Provincial military forces: As the governor of Sichuan, Liu controlled significant military forces within the province. He worked on improving these forces between 1930 and 1932, including organizing a small air force at Chengdu and establishing an "Armored Car and Tank Corps" in Chongqing[4].

5. Political maneuvering: During this period, Liu was engaged in complex political and military rivalries with other warlords in Sichuan. The province was unstable, with Liu competing against several other powerful figures for control[1][4].

6. Relationship with central government: Liu maintained a delicate balance in his relationship with Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang central government. While nominally aligned with the Kuomintang, Liu often acted independently and sometimes refused orders from Chiang[7].

It's worth noting that Liu's control over Sichuan ended in 1935 when he was ousted by his nephew, Liu Xiang. After this, Liu Wenhui was given control of the neighboring Xikang province as part of a family-brokered peace agreement[1][4].
