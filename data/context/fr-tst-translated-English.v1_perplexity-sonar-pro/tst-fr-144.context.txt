Neolana belongs to the family Stiphidiidae, which are sheetweb spiders found in the South Pacific region[9][10]. 

Neolana is a genus of spiders first described by Raymond Robert Forster and C.L. Wilton in 1973[10]. As of 2019, the genus contains only three known species, all of which are native to New Zealand[7][10].

Some key details about Neolana spiders:

1. Classification: They are part of the order Araneae (spiders) and class Arachnida[9].

2. Distribution: Neolana species are endemic to New Zealand, meaning they are found naturally only in that region[7][10].

3. Web structure: As sheetweb spiders, Neolana likely construct sheet-like webs to catch prey, though specific details about their web-building behavior are not provided in the given sources.

4. Size and appearance: The search results do not provide specific information about the size or physical characteristics of Neolana spiders.

5. Conservation status: The sources do not mention any specific conservation concerns for Neolana species.

It's worth noting that Neolana is a relatively small genus with only a few known species, which may contribute to the limited information available about these spiders in the provided search results. Further research from specialized arachnology sources would likely yield more detailed information about their biology, behavior, and ecology.
