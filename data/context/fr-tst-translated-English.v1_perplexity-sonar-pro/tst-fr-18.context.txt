The Fens are located around the Wash estuary in eastern England[1][3]. The Wash is England's largest tidal estuary, situated on the east coast where the counties of Lincolnshire and Norfolk meet[1][3].

This distinctive lowland landscape lies to the west of the Wash and covers a large area of approximately 1,500 square miles (3,900 km2)[6]. The Fens stretch across parts of several counties, including:

- Lincolnshire
- Cambridgeshire 
- Norfolk
- Suffolk
- Small parts of Northamptonshire (the Soke of Peterborough)[6][7]

The Fenland basin was formed by the erosive action of major rivers flowing towards the North Sea, combined with rising sea levels and tidal effects[4]. Four major rivers drain into the Wash:

1. Witham
2. Welland  
3. Nene
4. Great Ouse[1]

These rivers, along with numerous artificial drainage channels, slowly drain the low-lying Fenland towards the Wash[1][2]. Much of the Fens lies below sea level, relying on pumped drainage and sluice control to maintain its viability for agriculture[1][5]. The landscape is characterized by its extremely flat, open terrain with vast skies and extensive vistas to level horizons, creating a unique sense of place[1][9].
