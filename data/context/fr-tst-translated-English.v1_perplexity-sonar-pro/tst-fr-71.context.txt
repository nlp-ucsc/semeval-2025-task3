The Air France Flight 296Q crashed at the Mulhouse–Habsheim Airfield (ICAO airport code LFGB) in France on June 26, 1988[1][4]. Specifically:

1. The crash occurred while the Airbus A320 was performing a low-altitude flyover as part of the Habsheim Air Show[1].

2. The plane was supposed to fly over Runway 02, but at the last minute, the pilots noticed spectators were gathered near Runway 34R instead[1].

3. As the aircraft approached, it descended too low, reaching an altitude of only 30-40 feet above the ground[1][3].

4. At the end of Runway 34R was a forest that was not shown on the airport map given to the pilots[1].

5. Unable to gain sufficient altitude, the plane clipped the treetops at the end of the runway[3].

6. The aircraft then crashed into the adjacent forest, with the right wing being torn off upon impact[1][3].

7. The crash site was located at coordinates 47°44′58″N 7°25′34″E[1][4].

The accident occurred because the pilots flew too low and too slow, failing to clear the forest at the end of the runway. This resulted in the first fatal crash of an Airbus A320[1][4].
