Mesoplodon traversii belongs to the species known as the spade-toothed whale[1][5]. This species is part of the genus Mesoplodon, which includes several species of beaked whales[4].

The spade-toothed whale (Mesoplodon traversii) is considered the rarest species of beaked whale[5]. It is classified as follows:

- Kingdom: Animalia
- Phylum: Chordata
- Class: Mammalia
- Order: Cetacea
- Suborder: Odontoceti
- Family: Ziphiidae (also referred to as Hyperoodontidae in some sources)
- Genus: Mesoplodon
- Species: Mesoplodon traversii[1][2][5]

The species was first discovered in 1872 based on a lower jaw found in New Zealand[5]. For many years, it was known only from a few partial specimens. In fact, until 2012, nothing was known about its external appearance, as it had never been observed alive[5]. 

The spade-toothed whale is extremely elusive, with only six confirmed specimens as of 2024[5]. Five of these specimens were found in New Zealand, and one in Chile, suggesting that the species likely inhabits the South Pacific[5].

The species gets its common name from the shape of its teeth, which are large and wide, resembling the tip of a flensing spade used by 19th-century whalers[5]. This distinctive tooth shape helps differentiate it from other Mesoplodon species.

Due to its rarity and the lack of sightings, very little is known about the spade-toothed whale's behavior, ecology, or population status. As a result, it is listed as "Data Deficient" on the IUCN Red List[5].
