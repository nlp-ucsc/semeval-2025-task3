Based on the search results provided, there isn't specific information about the number of generations of G sedans. The search results primarily focus on the Mercedes-Benz G-Class SUV rather than Infiniti G sedans. However, I can provide some information about the Infiniti G sedan generations based on the limited data available:

The Infiniti G sedan has gone through at least three generations:

1. First generation: This would include the G20, which was the earliest iteration of the G sedan line[2].

2. Second generation: This refers to the G35 sedan, which was a significant redesign and upgrade from the previous generation[2].

3. Third generation: This includes the G37 sedan, which was an evolution of the G35[2].

4. Fourth generation (debatable): The Q50 is considered by some as the successor to the G sedan line, though it was rebranded under Infiniti's new naming convention[2].

It's worth noting that the G sedan evolved into the Q50 in Infiniti's lineup. The 2014 Infiniti Q50 is often considered as a continuation of the G sedan lineage, despite the name change[2].

The evolution of the G sedan shows improvements in performance over time. For example:

- The 2014 Q50 (latest evolution) had a 0-60 mph time of 5.2 seconds[2].
- The 2009 Infiniti G37 S (previous generation) was actually quicker, with a 0-60 mph time of 5.0 seconds[2].

These performance figures demonstrate the ongoing development of the G sedan line through its various generations, even as it transitioned to the Q50 nameplate.
