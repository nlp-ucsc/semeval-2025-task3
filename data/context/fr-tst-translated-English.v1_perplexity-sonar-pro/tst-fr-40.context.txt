Paul Hansen Egede's mother, Gertrud Rasch (also known as Gjertrud Nielsdatter Rasch), died on December 21, 1735 in Nuuk, Greenland[4]. She passed away during a smallpox epidemic that was ravaging the Inuit population in Greenland at the time[2]. 

Gertrud had been working tirelessly to care for children affected by the epidemic[4]. Her husband Hans Egede, known as the "Apostle of Greenland," wrote in her memory that the praise he could give her did not reach the heights that her Christian virtues deserved[4].

After Gertrud's death, Hans Egede carried her body back to Denmark for burial the following year[2]. She was interred at Nicolai Kirkeg√•rd (St. Nicholas' Churchyard) in Copenhagen in September 1736[4].

Gertrud's death was a significant loss for the Greenland mission. She had been a crucial support to her husband's work, having married Hans when she was 34 and he was 21[4]. Together they had four children, including Paul Hansen Egede, who would go on to continue his father's missionary work in Greenland[1][2].
