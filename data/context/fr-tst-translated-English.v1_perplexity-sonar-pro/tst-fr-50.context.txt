John Swinney got involved with the Scottish National Party (SNP) at the age of 15[1][2]. He joined the SNP in 1979 following a failed referendum on Scottish devolution[1]. This early involvement marked the beginning of his long political career with the party, which has spanned over four decades[2]. Swinney's commitment to the SNP from such a young age demonstrates his deep-rooted belief in Scottish nationalism and his dedication to the party's cause.
