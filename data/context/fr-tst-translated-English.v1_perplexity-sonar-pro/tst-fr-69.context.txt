I apologize, but I do not have enough specific information about the hydrographic situation of Mercy-le-Haut to provide a detailed explanation. Mercy-le-Haut is a commune in northeastern France in the Meurthe-et-Moselle department[7], but the search results do not contain any data about its rivers, streams, or other water features. Without access to local hydrographic maps or surveys of the area, I cannot accurately describe its water resources or drainage patterns. If you need details about Mercy-le-Haut's hydrology, I would recommend consulting more specialized geographic resources focused on that specific region of France.
