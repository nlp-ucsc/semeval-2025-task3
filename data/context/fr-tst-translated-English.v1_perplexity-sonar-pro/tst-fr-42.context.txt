Omega Centauri's classification has evolved significantly over time as our observational capabilities improved:

1. Ancient classification: Omega Centauri was first cataloged by the Greco-Roman astronomer Ptolemy around 150 AD. He classified it as a single star in his astronomical work, the Almagest[1][5].

2. 17th century observation: In 1677, English astronomer Edmond Halley observed Omega Centauri and reported it as a non-stellar object, specifically describing it as a nebula[1][2][3].

3. Early 19th century reclassification: It wasn't until the 1830s that English astronomer John Herschel correctly identified Omega Centauri as a globular cluster. He described it as a "beautiful globe of stars very gradually and moderately compressed to the centre"[1][3].

4. Modern understanding: While Omega Centauri is still officially classified as a globular cluster, recent observations have led astronomers to question this designation. Its unique characteristics, such as multiple stellar populations, high mass, and possible central black hole, have led some researchers to propose that it may actually be the remnant core of a dwarf galaxy that was stripped of its outer stars by the Milky Way[1][2][4].

This progression from "star" to "nebula" to "globular cluster" and potentially to "remnant dwarf galaxy" illustrates how our understanding of celestial objects can change dramatically as our observational and analytical techniques improve over time.
