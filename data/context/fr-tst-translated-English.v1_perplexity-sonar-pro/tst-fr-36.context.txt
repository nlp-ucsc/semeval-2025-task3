The city of Kaspiysk was originally named Dvigatelstroy (Дви́гательстро́й) when it was founded in 1932[1][4]. This name was based on the Russian word for "engine" and reflected the city's origins as a worker's encampment serving the needs of the nearby naval diesel engine manufacturer, Dagdizel[1][4].

The settlement began as an industrial site focused on producing engines and other military equipment. During World War II, it grew significantly due to increased wartime production and became a center for major arms manufacturers[1][4].

In 1947, the settlement received city status and was given its current name of Kaspiysk, reflecting its location on the shores of the Caspian Sea[1][4]. This renaming occurred as part of the settlement's transition from a worker's encampment to an official city.
