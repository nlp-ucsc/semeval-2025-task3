Emperor Kōkō passed his sons to the status of Minamoto, which was a prestigious imperial lineage. This can be seen from the extensive list of his children who bore the Minamoto name[1]. Some notable examples include:

- Minamoto no Ototsune (源音恒)
- Minamoto no Koretsune (源是恒)
- Minamoto no Sadatsune (源貞恒)
- Minamoto no Narikage (源成蔭)
- Minamoto no Kuninori (源国紀)

This practice of giving imperial princes the Minamoto surname was part of a system called "dynastic shedding" (世襲親王, sesshū shinnō). It was a way for emperors to manage the imperial lineage by removing some branches from the direct imperial line while still acknowledging their noble status. By granting his sons the Minamoto name, Emperor Kōkō effectively established them as high-ranking nobles outside the immediate imperial succession, allowing them to play important roles in court politics and administration without being direct contenders for the throne[1].
