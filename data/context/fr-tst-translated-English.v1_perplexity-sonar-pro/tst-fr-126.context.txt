The church of Sant'Isidoro a Capo le Case was initially built by Spanish Discalced Franciscans in 1622. Construction began in response to Pope Gregory XV's canonization of St. Isidore of Madrid that same year[1][6]. The Spanish Franciscans wanted to establish a convent for Spaniards and build a church dedicated to the newly canonized St. Isidore[6].

The initial architect for the project was Antonio Felice Casoni, who began construction in 1622[1][4]. However, the Spanish Franciscans encountered difficulties and abandoned the project after only two years[1][4]. The unfinished complex was then taken over by Irish Franciscans led by Luke Wadding in 1625[4].

Specifically:

1. Construction started in 1622 under the Spanish Discalced Franciscans[1][6].
2. Antonio Felice Casoni was the original architect[1][4].
3. The project was initiated in response to St. Isidore's canonization by Pope Gregory XV[6].
4. The Spanish Franciscans left the project unfinished after only two years[1][4].
5. In 1625, Irish Franciscans took over the unfinished complex and continued its construction[4].

So while the Spanish Franciscans initiated the building of Sant'Isidoro a Capo le Case, it was the Irish Franciscans who ultimately completed the church and established it as an important Irish religious center in Rome.
