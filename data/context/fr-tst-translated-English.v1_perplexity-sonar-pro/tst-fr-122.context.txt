The West Athens Regional Unit, which is part of the Attica region in Greece, consists of seven municipalities. These municipalities are:

1. Agia Varvara (Αγία Βαρβάρα)
2. Agioi Anargyroi-Kamatero (Άγιοι Ανάργυροι-Καματερό)
3. Aigaleo (Αιγάλεω)
4. Chaidari (Χαϊδάρι)
5. Ilion (Ίλιον)
6. Peristeri (Περιστέρι)
7. Petroupoli (Πετρούπολη)[1][4]

These municipalities collectively form the West Athens Regional Unit, which is one of the regional units created as part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform in Greece. This reform reorganized the administrative divisions of the country, creating regional units as subdivisions of the larger regions[7].

The West Athens Regional Unit is part of the broader Athens metropolitan area, which spans a larger territory within the Attica region. It's worth noting that this regional unit covers the west-central part of the Athens agglomeration, representing an important segment of the Greek capital's urban area[1].

Each of these municipalities has its own local government and administration, but they are grouped together for regional planning and administrative purposes under the West Athens Regional Unit. This structure allows for coordinated development and governance across the western part of Athens while maintaining local autonomy at the municipal level.
