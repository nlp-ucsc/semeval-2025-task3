According to legend, Theano and Pythagoras had five children together[1][2][5]. Their children reportedly included:

1. Three daughters:
   - Damo
   - Myia (also spelled Myria)
   - Arignote

2. Two sons:
   - Telauges
   - A second son whose name is uncertain

Some sources mention only one son, Telauges, while others include a second son named Mnesarchus[4][5]. The exact details vary between different historical accounts, with some mentioning only four children[3][6]. However, the most commonly cited number is five children in total[1][2][5].

It's important to note that the historical accuracy of these accounts is uncertain, as much of the information about Pythagoras and Theano comes from later sources and legends. Different ancient texts provide varying details about their family, and some modern scholars even suggest that Theano may be a composite figure representing multiple women mathematicians from that era[3][7].
