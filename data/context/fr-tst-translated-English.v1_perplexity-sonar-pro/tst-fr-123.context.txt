The Royal Palace of Gödöllő was built by Count Antal Grassalkovich I, a prominent Hungarian nobleman of the 18th century[1][2]. Construction of the palace began around 1733 under the direction of András Mayerhoffer, a famous builder from Salzburg who worked in Baroque and Zopf styles[1]. Count Grassalkovich I, who lived from 1694 to 1771, was a confidant of Empress Maria Theresa and held several important positions, including Royal Septemvir and president of the Hungarian Chamber[1][4].

The palace was initially intended to serve as a lavish country retreat for the Grassalkovich family[2]. It was designed in the Baroque style and became the largest Baroque manor house in Hungary[3]. The construction was completed in the 1760s, though the palace underwent several enlargements and modifications throughout the 18th century[1][4].

Count Grassalkovich's creation was so impressive that it set a new standard for Hungarian castle architecture, serving as an exemplary model for other Hungarian palaces of the Baroque period[4]. The original design featured a double U-shaped structure with 8 wings, including not only residential areas but also a church, a theatre, a riding hall, a hothouse, a greenhouse for flowers, and an orangery[1][4].
