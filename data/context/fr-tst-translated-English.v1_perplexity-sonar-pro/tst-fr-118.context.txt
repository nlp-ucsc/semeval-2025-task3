According to the search results, the two secret characters to unlock in Dissidia: Final Fantasy (the original PSP game) are:

1. Shantotto
2. Gabranth

To unlock these characters, you need to follow these steps[2]:

1. Complete the main story mode, including the "Shade Impulse" mission.

2. After completing the main story, two new "Distant Glory" missions will become available.

3. Complete the first "Distant Glory" mission to unlock the ability to purchase Shantotto for 1000 PP in the PP catalog.

4. Complete the second "Distant Glory" mission to unlock the ability to purchase Gabranth for 1000 PP in the PP catalog.

Additionally, completing the main story also unlocks a mode called "Inward Chaos". If you complete this mode, you can unlock Chaos as a computer-controlled enemy, though he is not a playable character.

It's worth noting that these unlock methods are specific to the original Dissidia: Final Fantasy game for PSP. Other games in the series, such as Dissidia 012 or Dissidia NT, may have different characters or unlocking methods.
