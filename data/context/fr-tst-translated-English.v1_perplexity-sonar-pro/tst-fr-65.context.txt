Before being Christianized, the Alemanni practiced a form of Germanic paganism centered around nature worship. Their religious beliefs and practices included:

1. Worship of natural features: The Alemanni venerated trees, rivers, hills, and mountain valleys[1][5]. These natural sites were considered sacred and were often chosen as locations for religious rituals.

2. Animal sacrifices: They sacrificed horses, cattle, and other animals in honor of their deities[1][5]. These sacrifices were typically performed by beheading the animals.

3. Worship of Germanic gods: While specific deities are not always named in sources, there is evidence that the Alemanni worshipped gods similar to those in other Germanic traditions:

   - Wodan (Odin): A runic inscription mentioning "Wodan" was found in the Alemannic area[5].
   - Donar (Thor): Referenced as "Wigi√æonar" in the same runic inscription[5].
   - Ziu (Tyr): Possibly one of the three main gods worshipped[5].

4. Sacred groves and outdoor worship: Religious ceremonies were often conducted in natural settings rather than in built temples[5][7].

5. Belief in an afterlife: Archaeological evidence from Alemanni graves suggests they believed in life after death. The dead were buried with personal items and fully dressed, indicating a belief that these would be needed in the afterlife[9].

6. Seeresses and divination: There are mentions of seeresses playing a role in Alemanni religious practices[5].

7. Beer sacrifices: Large beer sacrifices were reportedly made to Wodan[5].

8. Syncretism: As they came into contact with Roman culture, some Alemanni adopted syncretic practices, blending their traditional beliefs with Roman elements[9].

The Christianization of the Alemanni was a gradual process that took place primarily between the 6th and 8th centuries CE[1][7]. During this transition period, there was likely a mix of pagan and Christian beliefs, with some Alemanni superficially adopting Christian elements while maintaining their traditional practices[1].

It's important to note that our knowledge of Alemanni religious practices is limited and often comes from Christian sources, which may have biased or incomplete perspectives on their beliefs[3].
