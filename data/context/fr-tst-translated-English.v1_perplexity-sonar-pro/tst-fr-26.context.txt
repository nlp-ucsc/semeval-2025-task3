According to multiple sources, Folorunsho Alakija's father, Chief L.A. Ogbara, had a large number of children:

1. Some sources state that he had 52 children[3][4][6][9].

2. Other sources mention he had 23 children[1].

The discrepancy in the number of children reported may be due to different sources having access to varying information or possibly counting step-siblings differently. However, the majority of the sources provided, including Folorunsho Alakija's Wikipedia page, consistently report that her father had 52 children.

Additionally, it's mentioned that Chief L.A. Ogbara was in a polygamous marriage:

- Some sources state he had 8 wives[3][6][9].
- One source mentions he had 5 wives[1].

Regardless of the exact number, it's clear that Folorunsho Alakija came from a very large family. She is reported to be either the second surviving child[10] or among the earlier children, with her mother being Chief Ogbara's first wife[1][3][9].
