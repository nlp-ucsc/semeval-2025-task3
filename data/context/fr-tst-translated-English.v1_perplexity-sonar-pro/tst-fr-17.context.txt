Mouthier-Haute-Pierre initially developed around a monastery, which later became a priory. The town grew up around this religious establishment, from which it also derived its name[1].

Specifically, the monastery was known as the Monasterium of Alta Petra (Monastery of the High Rock). It was mentioned as early as 870 in historical records related to the division of Lothaire II's kingdom. Around 1120, this monastery was attached to the famous Abbey of Cluny and given the rank of a priory[1].

This priory played a significant role in shaping the town's early identity and economy. It's likely that during this period, around the 12th century, winemaking activities began in the area, which became an important part of the local culture and economy for centuries[1].

The priory building, dating from the 13th century and renovated in the 16th century, still stands in the village today. Although it's unfortunately not open to the public, visitors can see most of its exterior from the street[2].

The development of Mouthier-Haute-Pierre around this religious center follows a common pattern in medieval European town formation, where monasteries and churches often served as the nucleus for settlement and economic activity.
