Prince Philip used the Royal Yacht Britannia to travel to Australia for the 1956 Melbourne Olympics[1]. 

The Royal Yacht Britannia served as Prince Philip's transportation for an extended tour of the British empire in 1956, which included attending the opening of the Melbourne Olympics. As Queen Elizabeth's schedule did not permit her to attend, Prince Philip stepped in to represent the royal family at the Games[1].

During this voyage, Prince Philip visited several locations:

1. Australia - To participate in opening the 1956 Melbourne Olympics
2. New Guinea and nearby islands 
3. Antarctic - Prince Philip became the first member of royalty to travel that far south

The trip aboard HMY Britannia allowed Prince Philip to fulfill his royal duties while also providing an opportunity for him to "shine" and step out from under the Queen's shadow, according to contemporary accounts[1].

It's worth noting that while Prince Philip traveled on the Britannia, another royal yacht named Bluebottle also played a role in the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. Bluebottle was a Dragon class keelboat given to Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip as a wedding gift. Though Prince Philip did not sail it personally at the Olympics, he loaned it to the British sailing team. Under the helm of Lt Cdr Graham Mann, Bluebottle won a bronze medal in the Dragon class sailing event at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics[3][6].
