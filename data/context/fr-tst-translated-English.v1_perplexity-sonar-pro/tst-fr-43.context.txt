Cloelia was indeed a legendary Roman heroine after whom the asteroid 661 Cloelia was named[1][2]. 

Cloelia's story is set in the early days of ancient Rome, around 508 BCE, during a conflict between Rome and the Etruscan king Lars Porsena[2][5]. As part of a peace treaty, Rome was forced to send hostages to Porsena, and Cloelia was among them[2].

Demonstrating remarkable bravery, Cloelia orchestrated a daring escape from captivity[5]. According to the legend, she led a group of fellow Roman hostages across the Tiber River, swimming through its dangerous currents to return to safety in Rome[2][5]. This act of defiance not only humiliated Porsena but also inspired the Roman people, who hailed her as a hero[5].

When Porsena learned of Cloelia's escape, he was both impressed and outraged. Rather than punish her, he admired her courage and demanded her return[5]. The Romans, valuing integrity, returned Cloelia to Porsena. In a surprising turn of events, the Etruscan king released her and allowed her to choose additional hostages to be freed[2][5].

Demonstrating her selflessness, Cloelia chose to free the youngest and most vulnerable Roman captives, ensuring their safety and return to their families[5]. Her actions solidified her legacy as a protector of Rome's future and a symbol of Roman virtues.

The Romans celebrated Cloelia's valor by erecting a statue of her on horseback at the top of the Via Sacra, a rare honor for a woman in ancient Rome[2]. Her story became a part of Roman folklore, symbolizing courage, honor, and defiance in the face of adversity.

The asteroid 661 Cloelia, discovered in 1908, was named after this legendary Roman heroine, preserving her memory in the cosmos[1][7].
