Adolf Galland passed the entrance exam for the civil aviation pilot school in 1932. Specifically:

In February 1932, Galland graduated from Hindenburg Gymnasium (high school) in Buer and was among 20 personnel who were accepted to the aviation school of Germany's national airline, Luft Hansa[1]. 

During the final years of the Weimar Republic, jobs were scarce, so Galland applied to the Deutsche Verkehrsfliegerschule or DVS (German Commercial Flying School) which was heavily subsidized by Luft Hansa. He was one of 100 successful applicants out of 4,000. After ten days of evaluations, he was among just 18 selected for flight training[1].

So in 1932, at the age of 20, Galland successfully passed the entrance exams and was accepted into the civil aviation pilot training program at Luft Hansa's aviation school[4]. This marked the beginning of his career as a pilot, which would eventually lead him to become one of Germany's top fighter aces during World War II.
