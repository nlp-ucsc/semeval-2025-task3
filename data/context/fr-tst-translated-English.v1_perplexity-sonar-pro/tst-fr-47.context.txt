From a chemical point of view, ultramarine blue is a complex sodium aluminum silicate sulfide with the approximate chemical formula Na8Al6Si6O24S4[1][4]. It is an inorganic pigment that belongs to the aluminosilicate zeolite family with a sodalite structure[1].

The key features of ultramarine blue's chemical composition and structure are:

1. Framework: The pigment consists of interconnected aluminosilicate cages forming a zeolite-like structure[1].

2. Chromophore: The blue color is due to polysulfide anions (Sn-) trapped within the aluminosilicate cages. The most important chromophore is believed to be the S3- radical anion, which contains an unpaired electron[1][3].

3. Charge balance: The negative charge of the polysulfide ions is balanced by sodium cations (Na+) that also occupy the cages[1].

4. Synthesis: Synthetic ultramarine is produced by heating a mixture of kaolin (Al2Si2O5(OH)4), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), sulfur, and a carbon source (like charcoal or coal) at high temperatures (700-750Â°C) under reducing conditions[1][2].

5. Particle characteristics: Synthetic ultramarine blue consists of fine, uniform particles, typically ranging from 300 to 8000 nm in size[4].

6. Chemical stability: Ultramarine blue is stable under normal conditions and resistant to alkalis and high temperatures. However, it is sensitive to acids, even weak ones, which can cause it to decompose and release hydrogen sulfide[5][6].

7. Optical properties: The pigment has a refractive index between 1.51 and 1.63, contributing to its vivid blue color[10].

This unique chemical structure gives ultramarine blue its characteristic deep blue color and many of its useful properties as a pigment, including its stability in alkaline environments and its ability to neutralize unwanted yellow tones in various applications[3][7].
