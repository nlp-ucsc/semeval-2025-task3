The First Council of Nicaea took place in 325 CE. Specifically:

- The council opened on May 20, 325 CE in the city of Nicaea (now Ä°znik, Turkey)[1][3][5].

- It lasted for about a month, concluding on June 19, 325 CE[1].

- Some sources indicate the council may have extended until July 25, 325 CE[7].

Emperor Constantine I convened this council to address theological disputes in the Christian church, particularly the Arian controversy regarding the nature of Jesus Christ in relation to God the Father[2][5]. This was the first ecumenical council of the Christian Church, bringing together bishops from across the Roman Empire[1].

The council was attended by approximately 300 bishops, though the exact number is debated. Some sources cite 318 bishops based on Athanasius' account, while others estimate between 250-300 participants[1][7]. Notable attendees included Eusebius of Caesarea, Athanasius of Alexandria, and Arius himself, whose teachings were the main subject of debate[2].

The primary outcome of the council was the formulation of the original Nicene Creed, which established the doctrine of the Trinity and declared that Jesus Christ was "of one substance" (homoousios) with God the Father, rejecting Arius' position[1][5]. The council also addressed other matters such as the date of Easter celebration and various issues of church order and discipline[3].
