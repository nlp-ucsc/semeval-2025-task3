Based on the search results provided, I don't have specific information about the podium finishers for the women's over 67 kg Taekwondo event at the 2012 Summer Olympics. The search results mainly contain information about other weight categories or different Olympic years.

However, I can provide some relevant information about Taekwondo at the 2012 London Olympics:

1. For the women's 57-67 kg category (which is close but not exactly the over 67 kg category you asked about), the medalists were:

   Gold: Kyung Seon Hwang (Republic of Korea)
   Silver: Nur Tatar (Turkey)
   Bronze: Helena Fromm (Germany)
   Bronze: Paige McPherson (United States)[8][9]

2. The Taekwondo events at the 2012 London Olympics took place on August 10, 2012[5].

3. The venue for Taekwondo events in London 2012 was not specified in the search results.

Unfortunately, I don't have the specific information about the women's over 67 kg category for the 2012 Olympics. If you need this particular information, you might want to check official Olympic records or more specialized Taekwondo sources.
