The Jewish community was historically present and played a significant role in the town of Ożarów, Poland. Jews settled in Ożarów gradually starting from the 16th century and grew to become a major part of the town's population and economic life over the centuries[1][2][4]. Some key points about the Jewish community in Ożarów:

1. Population growth: The Jewish population increased steadily over time:
   - In 1662, there were 302 Jews in Ożarów
   - By 1787, the number had grown to 1,429
   - In 1857, there were 1,450 Jews
   - By 1921, the Jewish population reached 3,456[2]

2. Demographic majority: According to a 1931 register, out of Ożarów's total population of 4,410, 2,817 were Jews, representing about two-thirds of the town's inhabitants[2][3].

3. Economic influence: Jews played a crucial role in Ożarów's economy, owning and operating many businesses including:
   - A glass factory
   - A sawmill
   - A flour mill
   - Leather tanning workshops
   - Various shops and trades[3]

4. Cultural and religious life: The Jewish community had a rich social and religious life, including:
   - A synagogue with a characteristic roof
   - A Jewish religious school
   - Chapters of Zionist movements, the Bund, and Agudath Israel
   - Their own orchestra, amateur theatre, sports club, and library[2][3]

5. Coexistence with Polish community: While there were economic dependencies and some differences, many accounts suggest generally positive relations between Jews and Poles in Ożarów before World War II[2].

6. World War II and Holocaust: The Jewish community of Ożarów was tragically destroyed during the Holocaust. In 1942, the Germans concentrated Jews from surrounding areas in Ożarów before deporting them to labor camps and the Treblinka extermination camp[3][5].

The long-standing presence and significant contributions of the Jewish community made them an integral part of Ożarów's history and identity for several centuries, until their tragic destruction during the Holocaust.
