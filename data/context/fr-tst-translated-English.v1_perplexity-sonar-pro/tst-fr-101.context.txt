The birth of ice hockey in Miercurea Ciuc (Csíkszereda in Hungarian) was inspired by a film shown at a local cinema in 1929. According to the historical account, some young men in the city saw a newsreel or short film featuring an ice hockey match before a movie screening[1][2]. This visual introduction to the sport sparked their interest and motivation to form their own ice hockey club.

Specifically, after viewing the film, Lajos Vákár and other young people in attendance were impressed by what they saw and exclaimed "And we are in a position to do that!"[2]. This enthusiastic reaction marked the beginning of organized ice hockey in the city.

The geographical and climatic conditions of Miercurea Ciuc, located in one of the coldest regions of Romania, provided an ideal setting for winter sports[1]. The area already had a tradition of skating, with the first skating association founded in 1881[1]. However, it was this cinematic glimpse of ice hockey that catalyzed the formation of an actual hockey team in 1929.

Following this inspirational moment, the newly formed team quickly engaged in competitive play. In 1931, they were invited to play friendly matches against Tenis Club Român from Bucharest, marking their entry into formal competition[1]. These early games, including the first photographed goal in Romanian ice hockey history scored by Jenő Császár, further solidified the sport's presence in Miercurea Ciuc.

This origin story highlights how a simple exposure to the sport through film media was enough to ignite a passion that would lead to Miercurea Ciuc becoming a significant center for ice hockey in Romania, with a legacy that continues to this day.
