The name Maroilles comes from the village of Maroilles in the Thiérache region of northern France, where the cheese originated[1][2]. Specifically:

- Maroilles derives from the Gallic term "Maro Lalo" which means "great clearing"[1].

- The cheese was first created in the 7th century by monks at the Abbey of Maroilles (also known as Landrécies Abbey) located in this village[1][2]. 

- Initially, the cheese was called "craquegnon" after the Benedictine monk who developed the original recipe[1][3].

- In 960 AD, Enguerrand, the bishop of Cambrai, requested that the cheese be aged longer. After this change in production, it was renamed "Maroilles" after its place of origin[2][3][6].

- The name "Maroilles" was officially given to the cheese around 962 AD[1].

So in essence, the cheese takes its name directly from the village where it was first created by monks over 1300 years ago. The name Maroilles has been used for this cheese since the 10th century, reflecting its deep historical roots in this specific location in northern France.
