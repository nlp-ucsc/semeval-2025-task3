According to the Trésor de la langue française informatisé (TLFi), which is the digitized version of the Trésor de la langue française (Treasury of the French Language), an empire is defined as:

1. A political state, often a monarchy, that has achieved a much greater current size than its initial size by conquering surrounding territories, cities or nations[4].

2. A political unit ruled by an emperor or empress[4].

3. The group of states or other territories that owe allegiance to an imperial power (foreign to them), when distinguished from the native territory of that power; imperial possessions[4].

The TLFi is a comprehensive 16-volume dictionary of the French language covering the 19th and 20th centuries. It was published between 1971 and 1994 and is now freely available online[7]. This digital resource provides an authoritative and detailed definition of French terms, including "empire."

The definition emphasizes the key characteristics of an empire:
- Expansion through conquest
- Rule by an imperial authority (emperor or empress)
- Control over multiple territories or states
- A distinction between the imperial center and its subordinate peripheries

This aligns with broader historical and political understandings of empires as complex political entities that extend their power and influence over large areas and diverse populations[3].
