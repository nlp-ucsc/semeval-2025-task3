According to the latest FIVB Senior World Rankings for men's volleyball teams as of January 8, 2025, Cuba is ranked 12th with 249.34 points[1]. This ranking reflects Cuba's current standing among international volleyball teams.

It's worth noting that rankings can change based on team performances in various international competitions. The Cuban men's national volleyball team has a strong history in the sport, having won multiple medals in major tournaments over the years[4]. Some of their notable achievements include:

- Gold medal in the 1989 World Cup
- Gold medal in the 2001 World Grand Champions Cup
- Gold medal in the 1998 World League
- Gold medal in the 2022 Challenger Cup

Cuba has also been a dominant force in regional competitions, winning the NORCECA Championship 15 times[4].

The team continues to participate in major international tournaments. For instance, they were recently announced as part of the lineup for the VI Volleyball Nations League 2024, with star player Robertlandy Simon leading the 24-man team[2].

While Cuba may not currently be in the top 10 of the world rankings, their 12th place position still indicates that they are a competitive team on the global stage. Their performance in upcoming tournaments like the Volleyball Nations League could potentially impact their ranking in the future.
