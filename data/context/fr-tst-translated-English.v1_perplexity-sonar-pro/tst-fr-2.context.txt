Count Carlo Gozzi enlisted in the army at the age of sixteen[1][2][4]. Specifically:

Carlo Gozzi was born into a noble but poor Venetian family. Due to his family's financial difficulties, his parents were no longer able to support him financially when he was a young man[2][4]. As a result, in 1740, at the age of 16, Gozzi volunteered for military service[1]. 

He joined the military forces of Girolamo Querini, who was the Provveditore Generale (Governor General) for Dalmatia and Albania along the west coast of the Balkan Peninsula[1]. Gozzi served in Dalmatia for three years before returning to Venice[1][2][4].

During his time in the military, Gozzi discovered his talent for comedy. He performed as a member of a non-professional impromptu theatre company of male actors, playing the part of the soubrette[1]. His comedic abilities often excused him from regular military duties[1].

This early military experience at a young age helped shape Gozzi's future career as a playwright and defender of traditional Italian theatre forms like commedia dell'arte. After returning from his military service, he became involved in Venetian literary circles and eventually began writing his famous theatrical works.
