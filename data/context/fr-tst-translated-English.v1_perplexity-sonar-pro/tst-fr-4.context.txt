Police Academy is primarily a comedy film[1][2][3][4][5][6]. More specifically, it can be categorized as:

1. Slapstick Comedy: The movie features exaggerated physical humor and pratfalls, especially as the misfit recruits attempt to navigate police training[4].

2. Screwball Comedy: It follows a group of unlikely characters in absurd situations, with rapid-fire dialogue and farcical scenes[1][2].

3. Raunchy Comedy: The film contains adult humor and sexual content, typical of many 1980s comedies. It was originally rated R by the MPAA[1][4].

4. Underdog Story: The plot revolves around a group of misfits proving themselves against the odds, a common comedy trope[3][5].

5. Institutional Comedy: The setting of a police academy provides the backdrop for much of the humor, similar to other institutional comedies like "Stripes" or "Revenge of the Nerds"[4][5].

While primarily a comedy, Police Academy also incorporates elements of:

- Action: There are chase scenes and physical stunts throughout the film[3].
- Romance: A subplot involves a romantic relationship between two of the main characters[1][3].
- Social Commentary: The film touches on themes of discrimination and inclusion in law enforcement, albeit in a comedic manner[3][5].

Police Academy's blend of these elements, particularly its raunchy humor and slapstick comedy, made it a quintessential example of 1980s American comedy films[2][4][5].
