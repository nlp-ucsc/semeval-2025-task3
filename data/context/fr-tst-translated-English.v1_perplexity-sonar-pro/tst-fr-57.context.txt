The British Academy Film Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role has been awarded since 1969[2][3]. 

Some key details about this award:

1. It is presented annually by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) to recognize an actor who has delivered an outstanding supporting performance in a film[2].

2. The first winner of this award was Ian Holm for his role in "The Bofors Gun" in 1968 (for films released in 1968, with the ceremony held in 1969)[2][3].

3. The award has been presented a total of 54 times to 48 different actors as of 2023[2].

4. There was one year when no award was given in this category - 1980, when no actors were nominated for supporting roles[2].

5. In 1981, the award was temporarily replaced with a gender-neutral category for Best Supporting Artist, with all four nominees that year being male. However, this was only for that single year[2].

6. The most recent winner (as of the 2023 ceremony) is Barry Keoghan for his role in "The Banshees of Inisherin"[9].

7. The record for most wins in this category is held by Denholm Elliott, who won three consecutive times[2].

This award has become an important recognition in the British film industry, often serving as an indicator for potential success at other international awards ceremonies.
