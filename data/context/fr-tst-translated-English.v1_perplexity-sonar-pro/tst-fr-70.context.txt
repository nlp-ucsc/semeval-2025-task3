According to the Norse sagas, the fortress of Jomsborg was located on the southern shore of the Baltic Sea, likely in the vicinity of present-day Pomerania[1][2]. More specifically:

The sagas describe Jomsborg as a Viking stronghold situated on the southern Baltic coast, though its exact location remains uncertain[1][2]. Some key details about its purported location include:

1. It was believed to be near the Oder estuary[1].

2. Many historians and archaeologists associate Jomsborg with the area around modern-day Wolin, a town in northwestern Poland[1][2]. Specifically, it is thought to have been located southeast of Wolin Island, near the Silberberg hill north of the city[1].

3. The Norse sagas exclusively use the name "Jomsborg," while Germanic sources refer to it as "Jumne" or "Julin"[1][2].

4. Some theories place Jomsborg in the northwest of the island of Usedom, on land that is now submerged[1]. This area includes small islands that are remnants of a strip of land between Usedom and Rügen, which was flooded in the early 14th century[1].

5. The only source claiming to provide a precise location for Jomsborg is the controversial Gesta Wulinensis ecclesiae pontificum, allegedly discovered in 2019, which places it at coordinates 53°51′50″N 14°43′05″E[2][4].

It's important to note that despite these descriptions in the sagas, the exact location of Jomsborg remains a subject of debate among historians and archaeologists. Some even question whether Jomsborg existed as described in the sagas or if it was more of a legendary or semi-legendary place[2][4].
