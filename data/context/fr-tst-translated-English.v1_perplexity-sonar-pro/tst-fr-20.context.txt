Gordon Strachan made his debut as a professional footballer with Dundee in 1974[2][3]. 

Strachan joined Dundee as a schoolboy in October 1971 when he was 14 years old, turning down offers from other clubs including Manchester United. He initially remained in school and trained with Dundee in the evenings, before joining their ground staff full-time after leaving school[2].

Strachan's talent was evident early on, as he won the Scottish Reserve Player of the Year award in both 1973 and 1974 while playing for Dundee's reserve team[2]. 

His senior debut for Dundee came on July 29, 1973, at the age of 16, when he appeared as a substitute in a Drybrough Cup match against Raith Rovers[2]. However, his first start and full debut in league competition came in the 1974-75 season, which was the inaugural season of the Scottish Premier Division[2][3].

In that 1975-76 season, the 18-year-old Strachan established himself as a regular in Dundee's first team, making 17 starts in the league plus 6 substitute appearances, and scoring 6 goals[2]. This marked the true beginning of his senior professional career, although Dundee were unfortunately relegated at the end of that season.
