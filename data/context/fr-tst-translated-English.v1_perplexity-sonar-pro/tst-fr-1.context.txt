I apologize, but I do not have any information about a city called La Bellière or its creation following a major event. The search results do not contain any relevant information about such a city or its history. 

The only mention of "La Bellière" in the search results is in reference to a castle (Château de La Bellière) located in La Vicomté-sur-Rance, France[1]. This castle was erected at the end of the 14th century for Jean Ier Raguenel, then Viscount of Bellière. However, this does not relate to the creation of a city following a major event.

Without additional information or context about La Bellière, I cannot provide an accurate answer to your query. If you have any other details or if you're referring to a different location, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help further.
