According to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group IV (APG IV) botanical classification system, the genus Valerianella belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae[2]. This classification represents the most current and widely accepted taxonomic treatment of flowering plants.

Previously, Valerianella was placed in its own family, Valerianaceae. However, molecular and morphological evidence has led to the incorporation of Valerianaceae into the broader Caprifoliaceae family[3]. 

Specifically:

1. Valerianella is now considered part of the subfamily Valerianoideae within Caprifoliaceae[2].

2. The Valerianoideae subfamily contains about 7 genera and approximately 315 species of annual and perennial herbs[2].

3. This reclassification reflects a more comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary relationships among these plant groups.

4. Other genera formerly in Valerianaceae, such as Centranthus, Fedia, and Valeriana, are also now included within Caprifoliaceae[3].

This taxonomic change highlights the dynamic nature of plant classification as new evidence emerges. The inclusion of Valerianella in Caprifoliaceae provides a more accurate representation of its evolutionary history and relationships to other plant groups[2][3].
