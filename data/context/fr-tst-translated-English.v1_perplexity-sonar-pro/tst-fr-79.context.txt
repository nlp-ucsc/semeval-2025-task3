In Dan Brown's novel "Inferno", Bertrand Zobrist created a genetically engineered virus as his solution to save humanity from overpopulation. Specifically:

Zobrist developed a viral pathogen that would randomly modify human DNA to cause infertility in one-third of the population[3][7]. This virus was designed to spread globally and become endemic in all human DNA, but only activate in a certain percentage of people[3]. 

Zobrist believed this would reduce the human population to more sustainable levels and prevent an apocalyptic collapse due to overpopulation[2][5]. He saw it as a way to "save humanity" by forcibly curbing population growth, even though it would render many people infertile against their will.

Importantly, the virus was not intended to kill people directly. Instead, it would only affect fertility rates going forward[3]. Zobrist calculated that rendering one-third of humans infertile would be enough to halt population growth and bring numbers down to what he considered a stable level[3].

While Zobrist viewed this as a necessary action to prevent human extinction, others in the novel saw it as an unethical and dangerous plot that needed to be stopped[4][5]. The moral debate around Zobrist's actions and motivations is a central theme of the book.
