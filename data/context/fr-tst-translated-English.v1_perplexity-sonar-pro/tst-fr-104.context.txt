Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg is widely considered to have launched the Danish Golden Age movement in painting[1][4][8]. 

Eckersberg played a crucial role in initiating this period of exceptional artistic creativity in Denmark in several ways:

1. As an artist: Eckersberg developed a distinctive style that combined Neoclassical training with direct observation of nature. His cityscapes, portraits, and landscapes set a new standard for Danish painting in the early 19th century[1][8].

2. As a teacher: Eckersberg taught at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1818 to 1853, becoming director from 1827 to 1828. In this role, he had an enormous influence on the next generation of Danish painters[1][4].

3. Teaching philosophy: Eckersberg encouraged his students to "Paint whatever you wish" and emphasized drawing from life. This approach fostered a new spirit of artistic freedom and close observation of the world[2][4].

4. Influential students: He taught most of the leading artists of the Golden Age period, including Christen Købke, Wilhelm Bendz, Martinus Rørbye, and Constantin Hansen[1].

5. International perspective: Having studied in Paris under Jacques-Louis David and been influenced by Bertel Thorvaldsen in Rome, Eckersberg brought international artistic currents to Danish painting[1][8].

While Eckersberg was not the only important figure of the early Golden Age - sculptors like Bertel Thorvaldsen also played significant roles - he is often referred to as the "Father of Danish Painting" due to his pivotal influence on the development of the Danish national style in the early 19th century[1][4][8].
