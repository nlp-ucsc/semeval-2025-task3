Posey County, Indiana was named after General Thomas Posey, who served as Governor of the Indiana Territory[1][7]. The county was formed in November 1814 from parts of Gibson and Warrick counties[1][6].

Some key details about the naming of Posey County:

1. Thomas Posey was a Revolutionary War general who became Governor of the Indiana Territory[1][7].

2. The county was officially organized on November 1, 1814[7][10].

3. Posey County was one of the earlier counties formed in Indiana, as the state itself was not admitted to the Union until 1816[1].

4. Interestingly, Thomas Posey grew up on a plantation adjacent to George Washington's Mount Vernon estate. There were rumors that Posey was Washington's illegitimate son, though this was dismissed by Posey's biographer[4].

5. The county seat of Posey County, Mount Vernon, was named in honor of George Washington's Mount Vernon estate, creating another connection to Thomas Posey's background[4].

Posey County's location at the southwestern tip of Indiana, where the Wabash River meets the Ohio River, made it an important area in early Indiana history[1][5]. The naming of the county after Thomas Posey reflects the significance of territorial leadership in the early 19th century as Indiana was transitioning from territory to statehood.
