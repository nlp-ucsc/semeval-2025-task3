On July 27, 1955, El Al Flight 402 was shot down by Bulgarian fighter jets, resulting in a tragic incident that killed all 58 people on board[1][2][4]. 

The flight, operated by a Lockheed Constellation aircraft registered as 4X-AKC, was an international passenger service from London to Tel Aviv with scheduled stops in Vienna and Istanbul[1]. After departing from Vienna early in the morning, the plane veered off its intended course and strayed into Bulgarian airspace[4].

Two Bulgarian MiG-15 jet fighters were scrambled to intercept the airliner[1]. The exact sequence of events is disputed, but it's clear that the Bulgarian pilots ultimately fired on the El Al plane as it neared the Greek border[4]. The Constellation exploded at an altitude of about 2,000 feet, crashing near the town of Petrich in southwestern Bulgaria[1][4].

All 51 passengers and 7 crew members on board were killed, making it the deadliest incident involving a Constellation aircraft up to that time[1]. The victims included people of various nationalities, with 22 Israeli citizens among them[4][7].

The incident occurred during a period of high tension in the Cold War, with Bulgaria being part of the Communist Eastern Bloc[1]. It led to diplomatic tensions and legal proceedings, with Israel initially seeking significant compensation from Bulgaria[7][8]. Eventually, in 1963, Bulgaria agreed to pay a smaller amount of compensation to the families of the Israeli victims[4][7].

This tragic event remains the only incident in El Al's history where one of its aircraft was shot down[5], and it had a significant impact on the airline and Israel's international relations at the time.
