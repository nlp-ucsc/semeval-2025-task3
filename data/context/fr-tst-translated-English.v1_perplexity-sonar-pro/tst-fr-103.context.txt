The karbovanets replaced the Soviet ruble in Ukraine in 1992. Specifically:

On January 10, 1992, the karbovanets (also known as coupon or kupon) replaced the Soviet ruble as Ukraine's currency at a 1:1 exchange rate[1][3]. This came shortly after Ukraine declared independence from the Soviet Union in August 1991.

Some key points about this transition:

1. The karbovanets was initially introduced in November 1990 as one-time coupons to be used alongside rubles for purchasing essential goods[3].

2. In November 1992, the Ukrainian government declared that the Russian ruble was no longer legal tender in Ukraine, making the karbovanets the sole official currency[2].

3. The karbovanets was intended to be a temporary currency. It was originally planned to be used for only 4-6 months but ended up circulating until 1996 due to economic instability[1].

4. During the early period of its use in 1992, both karbovanets and Soviet rubles circulated in parallel. The karbovanets became the sole legal tender on November 12, 1992[5].

5. The introduction of the karbovanets allowed Ukraine to begin establishing an independent monetary system separate from the collapsing Soviet economy[6].

The karbovanets itself was later replaced by Ukraine's permanent currency, the hryvnia, in September 1996 at a rate of 100,000 karbovanets to 1 hryvnia[4][9].
