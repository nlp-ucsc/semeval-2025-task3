I apologize, but I do not have any information about specific counts of common murres in Brittany in 1936. The search results do not contain any data about common murre populations in Brittany, France for that particular year or time period. The provided information is mostly about common murre populations in other regions like Alaska and North America, their general biology, and some details about Brittany's geography and history. Without access to historical ornithological records from that specific region and time, I cannot provide an accurate count or estimate for common murres in Brittany in 1936.
