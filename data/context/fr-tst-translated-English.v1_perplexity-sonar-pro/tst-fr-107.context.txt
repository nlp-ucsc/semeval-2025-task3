The harmonic series is composed of unit fractions, which are fractions with a numerator of 1 and a positive integer denominator[1][3]. Specifically, the harmonic series is the infinite sum of all positive unit fractions:

\[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} + \cdots \]

In this series, each term is a unit fraction where:
- The numerator is always 1
- The denominator is a positive integer that increases by 1 for each subsequent term

This structure gives the harmonic series its unique properties:

1. The denominators follow a simple arithmetic progression (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...).
2. Each term is smaller than the previous one, as the denominator increases.
3. Despite the decreasing terms, the series diverges, meaning its sum grows infinitely large as more terms are added[1][3].

The use of unit fractions in the harmonic series makes it a fundamental concept in mathematics, particularly in calculus and analysis. It serves as an important example in the study of series convergence and divergence, and it has applications in various fields of mathematics and physics[2][5].
