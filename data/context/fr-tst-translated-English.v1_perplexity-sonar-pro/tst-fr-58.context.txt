Agastache belongs to the family Lamiaceae and the subfamily Nepetoideae[1][4].

The Lamiaceae, also known as the mint family, is a large family of flowering plants that includes many aromatic herbs like mint, sage, rosemary, and basil. This family is characterized by square stems, opposite leaves, and two-lipped flowers[4].

Within the Lamiaceae, Agastache is classified under the subfamily Nepetoideae. This subfamily contains a significant portion of the world's aromatic culinary herbs. More specifically, Agastache belongs to the mint tribe (Mentheae) within the Nepetoideae, and further to the catmint subtribe (Nepetinae)[1].

The genus Agastache comprises about 22 species of aromatic flowering herbaceous perennial plants, mainly native to North America, with one species native to eastern Asia[1]. These plants are commonly known as giant hyssops or hummingbird mints and are valued for their aromatic foliage and attractive flowers that bloom in late summer and fall[6][7].
