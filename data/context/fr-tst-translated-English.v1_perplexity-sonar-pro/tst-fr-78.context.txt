In 1954, Laurance Rockefeller began acquiring significant land holdings on Saint John Island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Specifically:

1. Rockefeller purchased the Caneel Bay Plantation, consisting of approximately 573 acres[4][9].

2. He acquired the Annaberg Estate and 2,000 acres of north shore land that had been transferred by the heirs of Herman O. Creque[1].

3. Over the next two years, Rockefeller, through his Jackson Hole Preserve, Inc. (JHPI), continued to purchase additional land parcels from various owners on St. John[9].

4. By December 1, 1956, Rockefeller had amassed a total of 5,086 acres on St. John[6][9].

Rockefeller's land acquisitions were part of a larger vision to create a national park on St. John. While he kept some land for private development, particularly the area around Caneel Bay where he established a resort, he donated the majority of his acquired land to the U.S. government for the creation of Virgin Islands National Park[3][5].

The total cost of these land acquisitions was approximately $962,100, averaging about $189 per acre[9]. This significant investment by Rockefeller laid the foundation for both conservation efforts and sustainable tourism development on St. John, cementing his legacy as a key figure in the island's history and environmental preservation[10].
