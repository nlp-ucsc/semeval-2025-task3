Based on the information provided in the search results, the land use of the commune of Labalme primarily consists of:

1. Forest: The commune is described as having dense forests, particularly in the north-east[2].

2. Farmland: The search results indicate that Labalme is a mix of forest and farmland[2].

The description specifically states: "The commune is mixed forest and farmland with dense forests in the north-east."[2]

It's important to note that this information comes from a Wikipedia article about La Balme-les-Grottes, which appears to be a different but similarly named commune. However, given the similarity in names and the lack of specific information about Labalme's land use in the other search results, this is the most relevant information available to answer the query.

The search results do not provide detailed percentages or acreages for these land uses. Additionally, there is no mention of significant urban development, suggesting that Labalme is primarily a rural commune characterized by its natural landscape of forests and agricultural areas.
