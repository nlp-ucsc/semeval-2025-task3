Retronyms generally appear due to technological advancements, societal changes, or innovations that create a need to distinguish the original version of something from a newer variant[1][3]. 

Specifically, retronyms emerge when:

1. New technology is introduced: For example, the term "acoustic guitar" became necessary after the invention of electric guitars[3]. Similarly, "analog watch" emerged to differentiate from digital watches[3].

2. Scientific advances occur: The term "visible light" was coined to distinguish the narrow visible spectrum from other forms of electromagnetic radiation discovered later[3].

3. Cultural or societal shifts happen: The term "business partner" arose as "partner" began to be commonly used for romantic relationships[1].

4. Product innovations create new categories: "Regular coffee" became a retronym after the proliferation of various coffee types like decaf, espresso, and lattes[1].

5. Historical events necessitate differentiation: "World War I" became a retronym after World War II occurred[4].

6. Changes in consumer habits or preferences: "Tap water" emerged as a term after bottled water became popular[1].

7. Shifts in prototypical meanings: When the most common or "usual" sense of a word changes, the original meaning may require additional specification[6].

In essence, retronyms are created when the original term becomes ambiguous due to the introduction of a new, related concept or item[2][5]. They serve to clarify and distinguish the original version from newer variants, helping to avoid confusion in language as our world and technology evolve[8].
