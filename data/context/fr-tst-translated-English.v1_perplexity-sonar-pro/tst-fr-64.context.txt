In 2004, a constitutional amendment was passed in Colombia that allowed presidents to serve a second consecutive term[1][2]. Specifically:

- The amendment was known as Legislative Act 2 of 2004[3].

- It modified the Colombian Constitution of 1991, which had previously limited presidents to a single four-year term[3].

- This change allowed then-President √Ålvaro Uribe to run for and win re-election in 2006, serving a second consecutive term from 2006-2010[1][4].

- The amendment faced controversy, with some officials in Uribe's administration later indicted for allegedly bribing congressmen to pass it[4].

- It marked a significant shift from Colombia's long-standing tradition of single presidential terms, which had been in place since 1910 (with a brief exception in the 1860s)[4][5].

However, it's important to note that this amendment was later repealed:

- In 2015, the Colombian Congress passed another constitutional reform that eliminated presidential re-election[1][3][4].

- This 2015 amendment reverted Colombia back to its original one-term limit for presidents[3][5].

- The change was proposed by then-President Juan Manuel Santos, who had benefited from the 2004 amendment by winning re-election in 2014[4].

So while consecutive re-election was allowed from 2004 to 2015, Colombia has since returned to its historical norm of single-term presidencies.
