Based on the search results provided, there doesn't appear to be a specific philosopher mentioned who talks about "collagism" when referring to artists who used collage starting in the 1910s. However, the search results do provide some relevant information about the history and development of collage as an art form:

The term "collage" and its use as an artistic technique originated with Cubist artists Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque around 1910-1912[1][4][6]. They were the first to pioneer this technique in modern art, incorporating materials like wallpaper, newspapers, and found objects into their paintings[4].

While the term "collagism" is not explicitly attributed to a philosopher in these results, it seems to be used in some contexts to refer to the practice or style of creating collages. For example, one result mentions "a deadpan collagism that highlights the self-abnegating character of his poetry"[1], though this is not specifically about the early 20th century collage artists.

The development of collage as an artistic medium was significant in the transition from Analytical to Synthetic Cubism[6]. It then spread to other art movements, with Dada and Surrealist artists like Max Ernst adopting and expanding the technique in the 1920s[6][8].

While no specific philosopher is mentioned discussing "collagism", art critic Clement Greenberg did comment on the appeal of collage to Cubist artists, noting how it allowed them to evoke dimensionality in their work[8].

If you're looking for philosophical discussions about collage as an artistic technique, you might need to explore more specialized sources on art theory and criticism from the early to mid-20th century.
