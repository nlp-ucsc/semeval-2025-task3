Libertas Klimka, a professor of history at the Pedagogical University of Vilnius, proposed the name Aukštojas for Lithuania's highest hill[7]. This name was chosen through a national competition held to find a suitable name for the newly discovered highest point in Lithuania[8].

The name Aukštojas has significant cultural and historical meaning:

1. Mythological connection: Aukštojas is derived from Aukštėjas, who is considered the Lithuanian equivalent of Zeus in ancient Baltic mythology[7].

2. Cultural significance: Aukštojas was one of the most important deities in ancient Lithuanian mythology and was considered to be the creator of the world[3].

3. Historical context: The choice of a pagan deity's name reflects Lithuania's historical background as the last European country to be Christianized, with pagan traditions still having a strong influence on the culture[7].

The naming process occurred after the hill was confirmed as the highest point in Lithuania in 2004. Previously, this spot had no official name, as it was not recognized as a significant geographical feature[8]. The competition to name the hill was part of a larger process of establishing the new highest point's identity and importance in Lithuanian geography and culture[7][8].
