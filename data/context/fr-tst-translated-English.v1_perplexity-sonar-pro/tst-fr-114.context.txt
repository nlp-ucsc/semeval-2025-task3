The NES Classic Mini (also known as the Nintendo Entertainment System: NES Classic Edition) has 256 MB of DDR3 RAM[3][5][6]. 

This amount of RAM is significantly more than the original NES, which had only 2 KB of RAM[1]. The increased memory allows the NES Classic Mini to run its emulation software and store game states, providing features like save points that weren't possible on the original hardware.

The system's specifications also include:

- A system-on-chip: Allwinner R16 with 4 ARM Cortex-A7 cores and a Mali400MP2 GPU[3][6]
- 512 MB of NAND flash storage[3][4][5]
- HDMI output capable of 1080p resolution[3]

This hardware configuration allows the NES Classic Mini to accurately emulate the original NES games while providing modern conveniences like high-definition output and save states. The increased RAM and storage compared to the original NES enable these enhanced features while maintaining faithful reproduction of the classic games.
