I apologize, but there is no information in the provided search results indicating that Pertinax was sent as a legate to any region in France in the year 186. The search results primarily focus on Pertinax's career in other parts of the Roman Empire, but do not mention any specific assignment in France in 186.

The closest relevant information from the search results shows:

1. Pertinax served as governor of Britain until 187, when he was forced to resign due to conflicts with the legions there[1].

2. After his resignation from Britain, Pertinax served as proconsul of Africa from 188 to 189[1].

3. Following his term in Africa, he became urban prefect of Rome[1].

The search results do not provide any information about Pertinax being sent to France as a legate in 186 or any other year. If such an assignment occurred, it is not mentioned in the given sources.
