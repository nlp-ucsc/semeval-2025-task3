The common chestnut (also known as sweet chestnut or American chestnut) is often confused with the horse chestnut tree. Here are the key differences between them:

1. Species and family:
   - Common chestnut (Castanea dentata) belongs to the Fagaceae family[2].
   - Horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) is from a different family, Sapindaceae[4][6].

2. Edibility:
   - Common chestnuts are edible and used in various culinary applications[4][7].
   - Horse chestnuts are toxic and can cause digestive disorders if consumed[4][6].

3. Leaf structure:
   - Common chestnut leaves are long, narrow, and have toothed edges[1][3].
   - Horse chestnut leaves are compound, with 5-7 leaflets arranged in a palm-like shape[4][6].

4. Fruit characteristics:
   - Common chestnut burrs are brown with numerous long, bristly spines and contain 2-3 small, flattened, triangular nuts[4][7].
   - Horse chestnut capsules are green with shorter, wider-spaced spikes and typically contain one larger, rounded nut[4][6].

5. Tree location:
   - Common chestnuts are usually found in woods, forests, or groves[4].
   - Horse chestnuts are often planted in urban areas, parks, and schoolyards[4][6].

6. Bark appearance:
   - Common chestnut bark is brown or gray with ridges that deepen with age[5].
   - Horse chestnut bark is typically darker and may have a scaly appearance.

To avoid confusion and potential health risks, it's important to carefully observe these distinguishing features when identifying chestnut trees[4][8]. If in doubt, it's best to consult an expert or avoid consuming the nuts altogether.
