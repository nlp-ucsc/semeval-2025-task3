The primary distinguishing features between male and female Brown-headed Cowbirds are:

1. Plumage color: Males have a glossy black body with a contrasting brown head, while females are entirely brownish-gray[2][4].

2. Head color: Males have a distinct brown head that contrasts with their black body, whereas females have a plain brownish-gray head that matches their body color[2][6].

3. Body sheen: Males exhibit a glossy black plumage with greenish or purplish iridescence, especially on their backs. Females have a much fainter gloss, if any at all[2][6].

4. Underparts: Male underparts are uniformly black, while females have subtle streaking on their underparts and wings[6][8].

5. Size: Males are slightly larger than females. On average, males measure 7.5-8.7 inches in length, while females measure 6.3-7.9 inches[4][7].

6. Overall appearance: Males have a more striking, contrasting appearance due to their two-toned coloration. Females have a more subdued, uniform brownish-gray coloration that can appear plain or dull in comparison[2][8].

These differences in appearance make it relatively easy to distinguish between male and female Brown-headed Cowbirds in the field.
