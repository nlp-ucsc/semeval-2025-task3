Bahram I reigned as the Sasanian King of Kings of Iran for a brief period from 273 to 276 CE[1][2][3]. He succeeded his brother Hormizd I and ruled for approximately 3 years[2][3].

Some key points about Bahram I's reign:

1. Ascension to the throne: He came to power in 273 CE with the support of the influential Zoroastrian priest Kartir[4].

2. Religious policy: Bahram I's reign marked the end of Sasanian tolerance towards Manichaeism. In 274 CE, he had Mani, the founder of Manichaeism, imprisoned and executed[3][4].

3. Family background: He was the eldest son of Shapur I, who had ruled from 240-270 CE[3].

4. Governorship: Before becoming king, Bahram I served as the governor of the province of Atropatene during his father's reign[1].

5. Succession: Upon his death in September 274 CE, Bahram I was succeeded by his son Bahram II[3][4].

While Bahram I's reign was relatively short and uneventful compared to some other Sasanian rulers, it was significant for its shift in religious policy, particularly the persecution of Manichaeism and other non-Zoroastrian faiths[1][3].
