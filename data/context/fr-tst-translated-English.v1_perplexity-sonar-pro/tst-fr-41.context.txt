Lil Dagover discovered cinema through her marriage to actor Fritz Daghofer in 1917. This connection introduced her to prominent figures in the German film industry, setting the stage for her acting career[2][3].

Specifically:

1. Dagover married Fritz Daghofer, an actor 25 years her senior, in 1917[2].

2. Through this marriage, she was introduced to notable film directors, including Robert Wiene and Fritz Lang[3].

3. Her screen debut came in 1913 in a film directed by Louis Held, but her marriage in 1917 seems to have been the catalyst for her more significant roles[3].

4. Fritz Lang cast Dagover in her breakout role as O-Take-San in the 1919 exotic drama "Harakiri"[3].

5. The same year (1919), she appeared in Robert Wiene's German Expressionist classic "Das Kabinett des Doktor Caligari" (The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari), which further established her in the film industry[3].

6. Although she and Daghofer divorced in 1919, the connections she made during their marriage had already launched her film career[2][3].

7. By the early 1920s, Dagover had become one of the most popular and recognized film actresses in the Weimar Republic[3].

Thus, while Dagover had some early exposure to film acting, it was her marriage to Fritz Daghofer that truly opened the doors to her successful cinema career, introducing her to influential directors and leading to her most significant early roles.
