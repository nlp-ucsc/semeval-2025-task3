I apologize, but I don't have specific information about the exact number of students who studied at the University of Haifa in its first year of establishment. The search results don't provide this precise detail. 

However, I can provide some relevant context about the university's early years:

The University of Haifa was founded in 1963[1][2][5]. Initially, it operated as Haifa University College under the academic auspices of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem[5]. 

In 1972, the University of Haifa received full academic accreditation and declared its independence, becoming Israel's sixth academic institution and fourth university[1][2]. This suggests that the period between 1963 and 1972 was a time of growth and development for the institution.

As of 2019, approximately 18,000 students were enrolled at the University of Haifa[1][2]. However, this figure represents the university's current size, not its initial enrollment.

Without access to specific historical records from the university's first year of operation, it's not possible to provide an accurate count of the initial student body. The early years of the institution likely saw gradual growth as it established its programs and reputation, but the exact numbers are not provided in the available search results.
