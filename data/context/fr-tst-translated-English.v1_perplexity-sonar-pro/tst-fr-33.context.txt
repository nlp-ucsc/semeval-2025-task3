Gergely Kulcs치r won two medals at the European Championships:

1. Bronze medal in 1958 in Stockholm[1][3]
2. Bronze medal in 1966 in Budapest[1][3]

Kulcs치r's first major international success came at the 1958 European Championships in Stockholm, where he surprisingly won the bronze medal despite being ranked only 22nd in the world that year[1][3]. This was an impressive achievement for the young Hungarian athlete early in his career.

Eight years later, Kulcs치r added another European Championships bronze medal to his collection at the 1966 event held on home soil in Budapest. He threw 80.54m to secure third place[1][3].

While Kulcs치r is best known for his Olympic achievements, these two European Championship medals were important parts of his long and successful career in javelin throwing. They demonstrate his consistency at the highest levels of international competition over nearly a decade.
