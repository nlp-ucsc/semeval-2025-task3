Based on the search results provided, I don't have enough specific information to determine what victory allowed Murray Albert Olmstead's team to become the best team in western Canada in 1944. However, I can provide some relevant details about Olmstead's early hockey career around that time:

Murray Albert Olmstead was born on September 4, 1926 in Sceptre, Saskatchewan[1][4]. In 1944, at the age of 18, he moved to Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan to play junior hockey[1][4]. 

The search results mention that in his first year playing junior hockey for the Moose Jaw Canucks in the 1944-45 season, Olmstead and the team challenged for the Memorial Cup after finishing the playoffs with a 15-1 record[1]. The Memorial Cup is the championship trophy of the Canadian Hockey League, awarded to the top junior ice hockey team in Canada.

While they were unsuccessful in winning the Memorial Cup series against the St. Michael's Majors, Olmstead had an impressive performance, scoring 10 goals and 8 assists in 17 playoff games that season[1].

So while I don't have information about a specific victory making them the best team in western Canada, it appears Olmstead's Moose Jaw Canucks team had a very successful 1944-45 season, winning their regional playoffs and advancing to compete for the Memorial Cup as one of the top junior teams in the country. This strong performance early in his career likely helped establish Olmstead as a promising young player.
