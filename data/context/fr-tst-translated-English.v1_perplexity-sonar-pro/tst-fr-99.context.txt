John Christopher Willis was prompted to study the distribution of plants during his botanical field work in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka)[1][5]. Specifically, he formed his Age and Area hypothesis while studying the distributional patterns of Ceylonese vascular plants in great detail[1][5].

Willis served as the director of the Royal Botanical Gardens in Peradeniya, Ceylon from 1896 to 1912[1][3]. During this time, he conducted extensive research on the local flora, paying particular attention to how different plant species were distributed across the island. His observations and analysis of these distribution patterns led him to develop his Age and Area hypothesis.

The Age and Area hypothesis proposed that the geographical range occupied by a species is primarily determined by its age - that is, how long the species has existed in that particular region[1]. Willis defined his hypothesis as:

"The area occupied at any given time, in any given country, by any group of allied species at least ten in number, depends chiefly, so long as conditions remain reasonably constant, upon the ages of the species of that group in that country, but may be enormously modified by the presence of barriers such as seas, rivers, mountains, changes of climates from one region to the next, or other ecological boundaries, and the like, also by the action of man, and by other causes."[1]

This hypothesis was a significant departure from the prevailing Darwinian explanations of species distribution, which emphasized natural selection and adaptation. Willis's work in Ceylon thus served as the catalyst for his development of an alternative theory to explain plant distribution patterns, leading to his publication of "Age and Area: A Study in Geographical Distribution and Origin of Species" in 1922[1][3].
