The Ritscher Upland was discovered during the Third German Antarctic Expedition of 1938-1939[1][4]. This expedition was led by German Navy captain Alfred Ritscher, after whom the upland was named[1][4].

The Third German Antarctic Expedition, also known as the German Antarctic Expedition (1938–1939), was commissioned by Hermann Göring, the "Commissioner for the Four Year Plan" of Nazi Germany[4]. The expedition had multiple objectives:

1. Economic purposes: The primary goal was to establish a whaling station and acquire fishing grounds for a German whaling fleet. This was intended to reduce Germany's dependence on imported industrial oils, fats, and dietary fats[4].

2. Territorial exploration: The expedition was tasked with assessing the feasibility of occupying Antarctic territory in the region between 20° West and 20° East[4].

3. Scientific research: The expedition carried out topographical and marine surveys, as well as biologic, meteorologic, oceanographic, and geomagnetic studies[4].

The expedition ship, MS Schwabenland, reached the Princess Martha Coast on January 19, 1939[4]. Between January 20 and February 5, 1939, the expedition conducted seven survey flights, mapping an area of approximately 350,000 km² (135,136 sq mi) using photogrammetric techniques[4]. During these flights, they discovered previously unknown ice-free mountain ranges and small lakes in the hinterland[4].

It was during this aerial reconnaissance that the Ritscher Upland was discovered and subsequently named after the expedition leader, Captain Alfred Ritscher[1]. The upland is described as a large ice-covered area in western Queen Maud Land, bounded by the Kraul Mountains and Heimefront Range to the west and southwest, and by Borg Massif and Kirwan Escarpment to the east[1].

After the initial discovery, the area was remapped from air photos taken by the Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition (NBSAE) between 1949 and 1952, providing more detailed information about the region[1][3].
