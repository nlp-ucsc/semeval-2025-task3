The name of Garajonay National Park comes from a tragic love story in Guanche folklore about two young lovers named Gara and Jonay[1][3][4][5]. 

According to the legend:

- Gara was a princess from the island of La Gomera, while Jonay was a prince from the neighboring island of Tenerife[3][4].

- The two met and fell deeply in love during a festival[5][6].

- However, their families opposed their union, especially after the Teide volcano on Tenerife erupted, which was seen as a bad omen for their relationship[3][5].

- Despite being separated by their families, Jonay swam across the sea from Tenerife to La Gomera to be reunited with Gara[3][5].

- The lovers fled to the highest mountain on La Gomera to escape[1].

- When cornered by their pursuing families, Gara and Jonay chose to die together rather than be apart[4][5]. 

- In most versions, they embraced and pierced their hearts with a sharpened stick made of cedar wood[3][4].

This tragic tale of forbidden love gave its name to the highest peak on La Gomera, as well as the national park that surrounds it[1][3]. The name "Garajonay" combines the names of the two lovers - Gara and Jonay[4][6].

The legend is reminiscent of other famous star-crossed lover stories like Romeo and Juliet[5][6]. It captures the spirit of the park, where nature and human folklore seem deeply intertwined[1]. Today, wooden statues of Gara and Jonay can be found in the park, commemorating this legendary romance[6].
