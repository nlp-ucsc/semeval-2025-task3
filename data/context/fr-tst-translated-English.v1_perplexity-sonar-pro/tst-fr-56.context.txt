The Anglo-Irish primarily descend from English Protestant settlers who came to Ireland during various waves of colonization and settlement, particularly from the 16th to 18th centuries. Here are the key points about their origins:

1. English Protestant Settlers: The Anglo-Irish are mostly descendants of English Protestant colonists who settled in Ireland during the Tudor conquest, the Plantation era, and subsequent periods[3].

2. Norman Heritage: Some Anglo-Irish families trace their lineage back to the Norman invasion of Ireland in the 12th century[3].

3. Old English Converts: A portion of the Anglo-Irish descended from the "Old English" - earlier English settlers who had come to Ireland in the Middle Ages and later converted to Protestantism[3].

4. Gaelic Irish Converts: Interestingly, some Anglo-Irish families were actually descended from Gaelic Irish nobility who converted to Protestantism and adopted English customs[3].

5. Mixed Origins: While primarily of English descent, the Anglo-Irish also included people of Welsh and Scottish ancestry[3].

6. Religious Affiliation: Most Anglo-Irish belonged to the Anglican Church of Ireland, though some were members of other Protestant denominations or, less commonly, Roman Catholics[3].

7. Social Class: The Anglo-Irish formed a distinct social class in Ireland, often referred to as the Protestant Ascendancy, who dominated Irish politics, economy, and society for several centuries[2][3].

8. Cultural Identity: Despite their English origins, many Anglo-Irish developed a distinct identity, often considering themselves Irish while retaining English cultural and political ties[2][3].

It's important to note that the term "Anglo-Irish" can be complex and sometimes controversial, as it encompasses a range of historical, cultural, and social factors beyond just ancestry. The Anglo-Irish played a significant role in Irish history and culture, producing many notable figures in literature, politics, and other fields.
