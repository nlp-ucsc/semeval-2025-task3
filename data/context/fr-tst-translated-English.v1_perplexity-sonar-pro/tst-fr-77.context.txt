The construction of the German warship Emden was delayed due to several factors:

1. Political instability in Germany in the early 1920s hindered the ship's construction process[1][4].

2. Germany's financial weakness and economic hardship in the aftermath of World War I caused significant delays[1][4]. The lack of steel due to economic problems was a particular issue[4].

3. British objections to the construction also contributed to the delay[4]. As one of the victorious Allied powers, Britain had influence over Germany's naval capabilities after WWI.

4. The Treaty of Versailles imposed strict limitations on German naval construction, which complicated the design and building process[10]. The Navy had to work within these constraints, leading to rejected design proposals and revisions.

5. There were personnel shortages in the design staff, and some naval blueprints had been destroyed, lost, or requisitioned by victorious powers after WWI[9]. This lack of resources and expertise slowed down the planning stages.

6. The Naval Inter-Allied Commission of Control (NIACC) rejected several German requests related to Emden's construction, including the use of steam turbines and boilers from scrapped vessels, as well as a proposed design with four twin-gun turrets[9]. These rejections necessitated design changes and further delayed the process.

As a result of these factors, while Emden was laid down on December 8, 1921, she was not launched until January 7, 1925, and was finally commissioned on October 15, 1925[1][4]. This extended construction period of nearly four years reflects the significant challenges Germany faced in rebuilding its navy in the post-World War I era.
