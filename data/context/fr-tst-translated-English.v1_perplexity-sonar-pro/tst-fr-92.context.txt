Turpan's main geographical asset is its unique location in a deep depression, which, combined with an ingenious irrigation system, allows for surprising agricultural productivity in an otherwise harsh desert environment. Here are the key aspects:

1. Turpan Depression: The city lies in the Turpan Basin, the second deepest inland depression in the world, with much of the surrounding land situated below sea level[2][3]. This unique topography creates a microclimate that, while extremely hot and dry, is conducive to certain types of agriculture when properly irrigated.

2. Karez Irrigation System: The cornerstone of Turpan's agricultural success is the ancient karez (also called qanat) irrigation system[1][4][6]. This network of underground channels and wells, totaling about 5,000 km in length, brings water from the snow-melt of the nearby Tian Shan mountains to the Turpan oasis[2][4]. The system's design minimizes water loss through evaporation, making it incredibly efficient in the arid climate.

3. Agricultural Productivity: Despite receiving less than 10 mm of rain annually, Turpan is renowned for its agricultural output, particularly its grapes and other fruits[4][6]. The area is often referred to as the "Grape Capital" of China due to its extensive vineyards[4].

4. Strategic Location: Historically, Turpan was a crucial stop on the northern branch of the Silk Road[1][3]. Its position between mountain ranges and deserts made it an important oasis for trade caravans traversing Central Asia[5].

5. Unique Climate: While the extreme heat (up to 49Â°C in summer) and aridity pose challenges, they also contribute to the high sugar content in Turpan's fruits, making them particularly prized[2][4].

6. Renewable Resources: The traditional building methods and materials used in Turpan, such as sun-dried mud bricks and poplar wood, are well-suited to the local environment and are sustainable[5].

This combination of geographical features and human ingenuity has allowed Turpan to thrive as a "green oasis in the middle of the desert"[4], supporting agriculture and human settlement in one of the world's most challenging environments.
