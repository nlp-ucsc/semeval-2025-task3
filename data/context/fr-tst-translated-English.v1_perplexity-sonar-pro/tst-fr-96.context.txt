The origins of Rosario, Argentina can be traced back to the early 18th century, though the city did not have a clear foundation date. Here are the key points about Rosario's origins:

1. Early settlement: In 1689, Captain Luis Romero de Pineda received lands in the area known as Pago de los Arroyos ("land of the streams") as payment for his services to the Spanish Crown[1][4]. He established the first permanent settlement, an estancia intended as farmland.

2. Initial development: In 1724, Santiago de Montenegro initiated another colonial settlement by setting up a mill, drawing plans for a future town, building a chapel, and becoming mayor in 1751[1][4].

3. Unofficial founding: Most commentators state that Rosario was founded on October 7, 1793, with a local population of 457 inhabitants[1]. This date is considered unofficial, as there was no formal foundation ceremony.

4. Early names: The area was initially known as Pago de los Arroyos. In 1725, the site was named Rosario[8].

5. Religious significance: In 1731, the Church of Nuestra Señora del Rosario ("Our Lady of the Rosary") was erected and became the early center of the city[2].

6. City status: Rosario was officially declared a city on August 3, 1852, following a request by Justo José de Urquiza to the governor of Santa Fe[1][4].

7. Port status: In 1860, Rosario was officially declared a port, which significantly enhanced its development[2].

It's worth noting that unlike many other Argentine cities, Rosario cannot point to a particular individual as its founder or a specific foundation date[1]. The city gradually evolved from a small settlement into a major urban center over time.
