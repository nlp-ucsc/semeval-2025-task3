Abdel Rahman Arif became the temporary President of Iraq following the sudden death of his brother, President Abdul Salam Arif, in a helicopter crash on April 13, 1966[1][3]. 

After Abdul Salam Arif's death, Prime Minister Abdul Rahman al-Bazzaz initially became acting president for three days[2][3]. However, on April 16, 1966, Abdel Rahman Arif was chosen by the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council to succeed his brother as president[3].

This transition of power occurred rather quickly, likely because the Iraqi military preferred to have Abdul Salam's brother, who was seen as weaker and easier to manipulate, take over the presidency instead of allowing the civilian Prime Minister al-Bazzaz to remain in power[3]. Abdel Rahman Arif's appointment allowed for continuity in leadership while maintaining the military's influence over the government.

Abdel Rahman Arif had previously served as the head of the army under his brother's administration[3]. His presidency lasted until July 17, 1968, when he was overthrown in a bloodless coup by the Ba'ath Party led by Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr[4][5].
