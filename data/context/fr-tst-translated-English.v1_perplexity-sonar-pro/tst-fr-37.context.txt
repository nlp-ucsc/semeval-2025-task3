Émile Reynaud referred to his animated film works as "Pantomimes Lumineuses" (Luminous Pantomimes)[1][3]. This term was used for the series of animated films he created and exhibited using his Théâtre Optique system. 

The Pantomimes Lumineuses premiered on October 28, 1892 at the Musée Grévin in Paris[3]. These animated works consisted of hand-painted images on long strips that were projected onto a screen, creating moving pictures. Some key points about Reynaud's Pantomimes Lumineuses:

1. They predated the Lumière brothers' first public film screening by about 3 years[3].

2. Each film contained around 300-700 individually painted images and lasted about 10-15 minutes[2][5].

3. The first three Pantomimes Lumineuses exhibited were:
   - Un bon bock (1888)
   - Le Clown et ses chiens (1890)
   - Pauvre Pierrot (1891)[2]

4. Later additions included:
   - Autour d'une cabine (1893) 
   - Un Rêve au coin du feu (1893)[2][5]

5. The performances combined the projected animations with specially composed music by Gaston Paulin[6].

By calling his works "Pantomimes Lumineuses," Reynaud emphasized both the visual nature of his animated projections ("Lumineuses" meaning luminous or bright) and their narrative, performative aspects ("Pantomimes" referring to the theatrical art of conveying a story through gesture and expression without speech).
