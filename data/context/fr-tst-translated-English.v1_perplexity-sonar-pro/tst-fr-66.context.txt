The Aloadae (Otus and Ephialtes) differ from the original giants in several key ways:

1. Parentage: The Aloadae were sons of Poseidon and Iphimedia, a mortal woman[1][4]. In contrast, the original giants were typically described as children of Gaia (Earth) and Uranus (Sky)[2][5].

2. Appearance: While the original giants were often depicted as monstrous beings with serpents for legs in later traditions[2], the Aloadae were described as extraordinarily tall and handsome youths[1][4].

3. Growth rate: The Aloadae had a unique characteristic of rapid growth, increasing by nine fingers every month[1]. This specific trait is not attributed to other giants.

4. Number: The Aloadae were specifically two brothers, whereas the original giants were a larger group or race[2][5].

5. Motivations: The Aloadae's actions were often driven by personal desires, such as wanting to marry goddesses[1]. The original giants, however, were primarily known for their collective war against the Olympian gods (Gigantomachy)[2][5].

6. Abilities: The Aloadae displayed specific feats like piling mountains to reach Olympus and capturing Ares[1][4]. The original giants were generally known for their great strength and aggression[2].

7. Cultural significance: The Aloadae were sometimes viewed as cultural heroes, credited with founding cities and being the first to worship the Muses[1]. The original giants were typically seen as purely destructive forces.

8. Defeat: The Aloadae were ultimately tricked into killing each other by Artemis[1][4][7]. The original giants were defeated in a great battle by the Olympian gods with the help of Heracles[2][5].

9. Afterlife: The Aloadae were said to be punished in Tartarus, bound to pillars with snakes[1][4]. The fate of the original giants varied, with some said to be buried under volcanoes[2].

These differences highlight the unique place the Aloadae held in Greek mythology, distinct from the broader category of giants.
