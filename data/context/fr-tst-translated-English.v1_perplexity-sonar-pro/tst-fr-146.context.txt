Sakata is located on the shore of the Sea of Japan[1][3]. This coastal city in Yamagata Prefecture sits at the mouth of the Mogami River where it flows into the Sea of Japan[1][8]. Its position along this sea coast was crucial to Sakata's historical development as an important port city and trading hub[7][9].

The Sea of Japan location provided Sakata with several advantages:

1. It allowed Sakata to become a major stop on the Kitamaebune coastal trade route that connected Hokkaido with Osaka during the Edo period (1603-1868)[7].

2. The city's port facilitated the export of local products like rice and safflower from the fertile Shonai Plain inland[7][8].

3. Sakata's coastal position, combined with its access to the Mogami River, made it an ideal transfer point between sea and river transportation[8].

4. The sea provides scenic views, with beaches like Miyaumi beach offering vistas of both the Sea of Japan and nearby Mount Chokai[5].

5. In recent years, Sakata's port on the Sea of Japan has begun welcoming international cruise ships, further utilizing its coastal location[3].

This seaside location continues to shape Sakata's identity as a port city and influences its culture, economy, and tourism to this day.
