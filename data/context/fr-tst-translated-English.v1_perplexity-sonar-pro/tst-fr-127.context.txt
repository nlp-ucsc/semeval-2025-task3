The Autonomous Province of Korçë, sometimes referred to as the Republic of Korçë, was established on December 10, 1916, by local French forces in collaboration with Albanian representatives[1][2]. Specifically:

1. Colonel Henri Descoins, the commander of the French garrison in Korçë, played a key role in its establishment[1].

2. Fourteen Albanian representatives from Korçë, consisting of seven Christians and seven Muslims, signed the protocol that proclaimed the autonomous entity[1][2].

3. The protocol was signed after the city of Korçë came under French control during World War I[1].

4. Themistokli Gërmenji, an Albanian nationalist, was appointed as the Prefect of Police in the newly established autonomous province[1].

5. The French military provided protection for this autonomous entity[2].

The establishment of this autonomous province was a result of complex political and military developments during World War I. It came after a period of contested control over the region, with various powers including the Ottoman Empire, Greece, and Albania claiming authority over Korçë[3]. The French intervention and the creation of this autonomous entity was part of the broader geopolitical maneuvering in the Balkans during the war.

It's worth noting that while it's often referred to as a "republic," its official designation was the "Autonomous Province of Korçë," and it remained under French military protection throughout its existence from 1916 to 1920[1].
