Róger Guedes requested his transfer from Palmeiras due to harassment and bullying he experienced from his teammates[1][3]. 

In 2017, a disturbing incident occurred during a Palmeiras training session. A video emerged showing Guedes taking part in a fitness session on the practice pitch when his teammates chased him, pinned him to the ground, and tied him up with wire[1]. This happened while coaching staff and the manager Cuca looked on without intervening[1].

According to Guedes, this was not an isolated incident. He stated that he had been physically harassed by Palmeiras players on multiple occasions[1]. The justification given for this cruel treatment was supposedly to "toughen him up" for big games[1].

This abusive behavior from his teammates created an intolerable environment for Guedes. As a result, on December 27, 2017, he joined Atlético Mineiro on a season-long loan deal[1]. Guedes himself confirmed that the harassment he received from his Palmeiras teammates was the primary reason for requesting this loan move away from the club[1][3].

This incident highlights serious issues with team culture and player treatment that existed at Palmeiras during that time. The lack of intervention from coaching staff is particularly concerning. For Guedes, the transfer provided an escape from a toxic and abusive situation that was impacting both his personal well-being and professional development.
