Sophie Nélisse won the Genie Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Alice L'Écuyer in the 2011 film "Monsieur Lazhar"[6][8]. This was a breakthrough performance for Nélisse, who was only 11 years old at the time. In the film, she played a member of an elementary school class dealing with the aftermath of their teacher's suicide[7].

For this same role, Nélisse also won the Jutra Award for Best Supporting Actress[6][8]. Additionally, her performance earned her a Young Artist Award nomination for Best Leading Young Actress in an International Feature Film[2][6].

"Monsieur Lazhar" was critically acclaimed and went on to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film[9]. Nélisse's nuanced portrayal of Alice, a sensitive and reserved student, was particularly praised, showcasing emotional depth far beyond her years[7].

This early success in "Monsieur Lazhar" helped launch Nélisse's career, leading to more prominent roles in both French and English-language productions, including her starring role in "The Book Thief" in 2013[8][9].
