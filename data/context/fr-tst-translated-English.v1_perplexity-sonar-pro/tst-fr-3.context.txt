Pseudomugil gertrudae, commonly known as the spotted blue-eye, is a small freshwater fish native to northern Australia and southern New Guinea[7][9]. It is a member of the family Pseudomugilidae, which is related to rainbowfishes but differs in some anatomical features[8]. As a chordate and vertebrate, it possesses a notochord, dorsal nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail at some point in its life cycle - key characteristics of the phylum Chordata.
