HEALTH was founded in Los Angeles, California in 2005. The founding members of the band are:

1. Jake Duzsik - vocalist and guitarist[1][3]
2. John Famiglietti - bassist and producer[1][3]
3. Benjamin (B.J.) Miller - drummer[1][4]
4. Jupiter Keyes - guitarist and keyboardist (left the band in 2015)[1][4]

Jake Duzsik and John Famiglietti initially met while working at the flagship Guitar Center in Los Angeles[1]. They decided to form a band and recruited Jupiter Keyes, whom Duzsik knew from university, and drummer B.J. Miller[1]. 

The band's name was chosen after the members agreed it should be an "everyday word". When reviewing a list of terms, "health" was the only one not already taken by another band[1]. They had initially considered the name "Medicine" but discovered it was already in use by a 90s L.A. shoegaze band[3].

HEALTH quickly became part of Los Angeles' underground experimental music scene, playing their early shows at venues like The Smell[1][7]. They gained wider recognition with a remix of their song "Crimewave" by Crystal Castles in 2007, followed by the release of their self-titled debut album later that year[1].
