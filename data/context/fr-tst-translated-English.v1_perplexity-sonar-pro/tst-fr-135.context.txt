"The Leftovers" is an American television series that takes place three years after a mysterious global event called the "Sudden Departure," where 2% of the world's population (approximately 140 million people) inexplicably vanished without a trace[3][4]. The series primarily focuses on the lives of those left behind in the fictional town of Mapleton, New York, as they struggle to cope with the aftermath of this inexplicable event[1][3].

The show centers around several key characters:

1. Kevin Garvey Jr., the chief of police in Mapleton[3].
2. Laurie Garvey, Kevin's wife who joins a cult called the Guilty Remnant[3].
3. Tommy Garvey, Kevin's son who becomes a follower of another cult leader named Holy Wayne[3].
4. Jill Garvey, Kevin's daughter who is struggling with the new reality[3].
5. Nora Durst, a grieving widow who lost her entire family in the Departure[3].
6. Matt Jamison, Nora's brother and a reverend grappling with faith after the event[3].

The series explores themes of grief, faith, and the human struggle to find meaning in the face of inexplicable loss. It delves into the emergence of new cults and belief systems that arise in response to the Departure, most notably the Guilty Remnant, a nihilistic group whose members wear white, chain-smoke, and take a vow of silence[3].

As the show progresses, it examines how different characters cope with their trauma, attempt to move on with their lives, or become consumed by the mystery of the Departure. The narrative often blurs the line between reality and the supernatural, leaving many events open to interpretation[2][5].

"The Leftovers" is known for its complex characters, emotional depth, and willingness to explore philosophical and existential questions without providing easy answers[5]. The series ran for three seasons on HBO from 2014 to 2017, garnering critical acclaim for its bold storytelling and performances[2].
