The Alpine belt began to form during the Late Mesozoic era, specifically in the Cretaceous period, and continued developing through the Cenozoic era[1][2]. Here are the key points about the formation of the Alpine belt:

## Initial Stages

- The process started in the late Cretaceous period, approximately 100 million years ago[1][2].
- It began when the divergent movement between the European and African plates ceased, and convergence began[1].

## Main Phases of Mountain Building

- The major phases of mountain building began in the Paleocene to Eocene epochs of the Cenozoic era[2].
- The process intensified during the Oligocene and Miocene epochs[1].

## Ongoing Process

- The Alpine orogeny is still active today in some parts of the Alpide mountain ranges[2][7].

## Cause

The formation of the Alpine belt was caused by the collision of several tectonic plates:

- The African, Arabian, and Indian plates moving northward[2]
- The Eurasian plate in the north[2]
- Several smaller plates and microplates in between[2]

This collision led to the closure of the Tethys Ocean, which existed between these continents[1][2].

The Alpine orogeny is considered one of the three major phases of mountain building in Europe, following the Caledonian and Hercynian (or Variscan) orogenies[2][8]. It has shaped not only the Alps but also numerous other mountain ranges across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, collectively known as the Alpide belt[2][6].
