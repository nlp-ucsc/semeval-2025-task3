The first round matches of the 1931 Ice Hockey World Championship were as follows:

1. Czechoslovakia defeated Hungary 4-1 (2-0, 1-1, 1-0)[4].

2. Austria beat Great Britain 1-0 in double overtime (0-0, 0-0, 0-0, OT: 0-0, 1-0)[4].

These two matches took place on February 1, 1931, at the Lodowisko arena in Krynica, Poland[4]. The winning teams (Czechoslovakia and Austria) advanced to the second round, while the losing teams (Hungary and Great Britain) were moved to the consolation round[4].

It's worth noting that only four teams competed in this initial round, with the winners progressing further in the tournament[4]. The 1931 World Championship was the fifth edition of the tournament and also served as the 15th European Championship[4].
