Chuseok, often referred to as Korean Thanksgiving, is a major harvest festival and three-day holiday in Korea that celebrates the autumn harvest and honors ancestors. Here are the key aspects of what Chuseok celebrates:

1. Harvest Celebration: Chuseok is fundamentally a harvest festival, giving thanks for a bountiful autumn harvest[1][2]. It's a time to express gratitude for the year's agricultural abundance.

2. Ancestral Reverence: The holiday has strong ties to ancestor worship and filial piety. Families perform memorial services called "charye" to honor their ancestors and express gratitude for their blessings[1][2].

3. Family Reunions: Chuseok is a time for families to gather, often traveling to their ancestral hometowns. It's one of the biggest annual migrations in Korea, with about 75% of the population participating in this mass movement[2].

4. Traditional Customs: The holiday involves various traditional practices:
   - Preparing and sharing special foods, particularly songpyeon (half-moon shaped rice cakes)[1][2]
   - Visiting ancestral graves (seongmyo) and tending to them (beolcho)[1]
   - Wearing traditional Korean attire (hanbok)[5]
   - Playing traditional games and sports like ssireum (Korean wrestling)[1][2]

5. Cultural Heritage: Chuseok celebrates Korean cultural identity and heritage. It's a time when many Koreans engage in traditional activities, reinforcing cultural bonds and passing down customs to younger generations[1][5].

6. Autumn's Arrival: The festival marks the transition into autumn, celebrating the full harvest moon. It's sometimes called "Hangawi," meaning "the great middle of autumn"[3][6].

7. Community and Sharing: Beyond family gatherings, Chuseok traditionally involved community celebrations, sharing food with neighbors, and expressing collective gratitude[2].

8. Modern Adaptations: While rooted in agrarian traditions, Chuseok has evolved in modern times. It remains a significant holiday for Koreans, blending traditional customs with contemporary practices of gift-giving and enjoying time off work[4].

In essence, Chuseok celebrates the interconnectedness of family, community, nature, and cultural heritage, centered around the theme of gratitude for the harvest and ancestral blessings.
