Herman Frazier won his Olympic gold medal as part of the United States 4x400 meter relay team at the 1976 Montreal Olympics[1][2][3]. The other members of this gold medal-winning relay team were:

1. Benny Brown
2. Fred Newhouse
3. Maxie Parks

Frazier ran the first leg of this relay[3][5], setting the pace for his teammates. The team completed the race in a time of 2:58:65[8], winning the gold medal by a significant margin of nearly three seconds[6].

This victory was particularly special for Frazier, as he was just 21 years old at the time and the youngest runner on the U.S. track team at those Olympics[2]. It's worth noting that in addition to this gold medal, Frazier also won an individual bronze medal in the 400-meter dash at the same Olympics[1][3][4].
