TimeGate Studios developed two expansions for the original F.E.A.R. game:

1. F.E.A.R. Extraction Point - Released in October 2006, this was the first expansion pack for F.E.A.R.[1][5]

2. F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate - Released in November 2007, this was the second standalone expansion pack developed by TimeGate Studios[1][2]

Both of these expansions continued the story and gameplay of the original F.E.A.R., adding new weapons, enemies, and environments while maintaining the core mechanics that made the base game popular[3][5]. However, it's worth noting that these expansions are no longer considered canon in the F.E.A.R. universe, as the events depicted in them were disregarded by the official sequel, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin, developed by Monolith Productions[5].

The expansions were initially released separately for PC, but were later bundled together as F.E.A.R. Files for the Xbox 360[1][5]. They were also included in various re-releases of the game, such as the F.E.A.R. Gold Edition and F.E.A.R. Platinum Collection[5].
