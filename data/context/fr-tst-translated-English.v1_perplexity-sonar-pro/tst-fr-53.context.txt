Daniel Edward Lungren was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1979[1][10]. Specifically:

- He was elected as a Republican to the 96th Congress, which began on January 3, 1979[10].
- This marked the start of his first stint in Congress, representing portions of Long Beach and Orange County in California[1].
- Lungren served five consecutive terms in the House of Representatives from 1979 to 1989[1][4].

During this initial period in Congress, Lungren:

- Became one of Newt Gingrich's chief lieutenants[1]
- Was a founding member of the Conservative Opportunity Society[1][4]
- Served on the House Judiciary Committee, where he pushed for "tough on crime" legislation[1]

This election in 1979 launched Lungren's career as a congressman, which would later include another stint in the House from 2005 to 2013 representing a different California district[1]. Between his two periods in Congress, Lungren also served as Attorney General of California from 1991 to 1999[1][2].
