VinFast was announced as the title sponsor of the first ever Formula 1 Vietnam Grand Prix[2][5][7][8][9]. VinFast is Vietnam's largest car manufacturer and is part of VinGroup, which was appointed as the promoter of the Vietnam Grand Prix in 2017[2]. 

The partnership was announced on October 14, 2019, with VinFast signing a multi-year deal to be the title sponsor for the race that was initially scheduled to take place from April 3-5, 2020, on a brand-new street circuit in Hanoi[2][5]. 

Chase Carey, Chairman and CEO of Formula 1, expressed enthusiasm about the partnership, stating that VinFast's young, dynamic, and ambitious qualities made it an ideal partner to grow the sport in Vietnam[2][10]. This sponsorship was seen as a significant milestone for the Formula 1 Vietnam Grand Prix, providing a boost to the event's preparations and aligning with Vietnam's growing presence on the global stage[2].

It's worth noting that despite the sponsorship announcement and preparations, the inaugural Vietnam Grand Prix was ultimately postponed and later cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic[1]. As of 2024, the race has not yet taken place, and there is no official announcement regarding when or if the Vietnamese Grand Prix will make its debut[1].
