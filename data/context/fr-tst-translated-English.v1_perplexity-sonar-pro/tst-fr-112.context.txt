Nina Curtis won a silver medal at the 2012 London Olympic Games, which is her best Olympic medal achievement[1][3][4]. 

Specifically, Curtis competed in the Elliott 6m sailing event at the 2012 Olympics as part of the Australian women's match racing team. Along with her teammates Olivia Price and Lucinda Whitty, Curtis secured the silver medal in this event[3][4].

This silver medal performance was particularly impressive as it came in Curtis's Olympic debut at the age of 24. The Elliott 6m team event was a new addition to the Olympic sailing program in 2012, making Curtis and her teammates pioneers in this Olympic discipline[2].

Curtis's Olympic silver medal stands out as one of her career highlights in competitive sailing. It capped off a strong run of performances leading up to the Olympics, including gold at the 2009 Women's Match Racing World Championships and multiple podium finishes in World Cup events in 2011-2012[3].

While Curtis has had many other sailing accomplishments, including world championship medals and participation in prestigious races like the Sydney to Hobart, her Olympic silver remains her top achievement on the Olympic stage[3][7]. This medal contributed to Australia's strong overall sailing performance at the 2012 Games, where the country won 3 gold medals and 1 silver in total[2][4].
