I apologize, but there appears to be an error in the query. Based on the search results provided and my knowledge, Geoffroi de Villehardouin did not participate in the Third Crusade, nor was he captured during any crusade. 

Geoffroi de Villehardouin was actually a key figure in the Fourth Crusade, which took place from 1201-1204[1][4]. He served as one of the leaders of this crusade and chronicled its events in his work "De la ConquÃªte de Constantinople" (On the Conquest of Constantinople)[1][4].

Some key points about Villehardouin's involvement in the Fourth Crusade:

1. He joined the crusade in 1199 during a tournament held by Count Thibaud III of Champagne[1].

2. Villehardouin was appointed as one of the ambassadors sent to Venice to procure ships for the crusade[1].

3. He likely supported the diversion of the crusade to Constantinople, though he doesn't explicitly state this in his account[1].

4. After the conquest of the Byzantine Empire in 1204, Villehardouin served as a military leader[1].

5. He led the retreat from the Battle of Adrianople in 1205 when Baldwin I was captured by Bulgarian forces[1].

6. For his services, Boniface of Montferrat gave Villehardouin the city of Messinopolis in Thrace[1].

7. He began writing his chronicle of the Fourth Crusade around 1207[1][4].

It's important to note that Villehardouin was not captured during the Fourth Crusade. Instead, he played a crucial role in its leadership and later became an important chronicler of its events. His account is considered one of the earliest works of French prose and a valuable historical source for understanding the Fourth Crusade[1][4].
