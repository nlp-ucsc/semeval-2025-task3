Chichester's foundation dates back to Roman times, specifically to around 43-44 AD when the Romans invaded Britain. Here are the key details about the city's founding:

1. Roman origins: The Romans established a fort on the site of present-day Chichester around 44 AD, shortly after their invasion of Britain in 43 AD[6]. They chose this location due to its strategic advantages:
   - It was near a source of water (the River Lavant)
   - It was close to a harbor, allowing supplies to be brought in by ship from France

2. Transition to a town: After the Roman military moved on, the local Celtic tribal king, Cogidubnus (also spelled Cogidubnus), who had cooperated with the Romans, took over the fort and developed it into a town[6].

3. Roman name: The Romans called the settlement Noviomagus, which means "new marketplace"[6]. It was also known as Noviomagus Reginorum, serving as the capital of the Civitas Reginorum[5].

4. City layout: The basic Roman street plan, with roads radiating from a central point to the north, south, east, and west, still forms the core of Chichester's layout today[5].

5. Early development: The Romans built typical urban features, including a forum (marketplace) and public buildings. They also constructed a city wall, parts of which still exist in the lower sections of Chichester's current walls[5].

While the Roman foundation marks the beginning of Chichester as an urban center, it's important to note that the city's history and development continued through subsequent periods, including Saxon and Norman times, each adding layers to its rich historical tapestry.
