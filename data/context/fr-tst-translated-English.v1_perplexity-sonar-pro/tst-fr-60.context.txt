In April 2012, Choe Ryong-hae was promoted to several important positions:

1. Vice Marshal of the Korean People's Army[1][4][6]

2. Member of the Presidium of the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea[4][6]

3. Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission[4][6]

4. Director of the Korean People's Army General Political Bureau[4][6]

5. Member of the National Defence Commission[4][6]

These promotions significantly elevated Choe's status within the North Korean leadership hierarchy. He was seen as a key figure in securing Kim Jong Un's leadership following Kim Jong Il's death in December 2011[6]. Choe's rapid rise, especially his appointment as Director of the KPA General Political Bureau despite his limited military background, was viewed as part of Kim Jong Un's efforts to reassert party control over the military[6].
