Emperor Go-Daigo reigned during the first Genkō era, which lasted from August 1331 to January 1334[1][4]. This era marked a significant period in Japanese history, as it coincided with the Genkō War (元弘の乱, Genkō no Ran) that lasted for the entire duration of the era[1].

Some key points about Emperor Go-Daigo and the Genkō era:

1. Emperor Go-Daigo adopted the era name "Genkō" in 1331, signaling his attempt to assert imperial authority[4].

2. During this time, there was a rival emperor in Kyoto named Emperor Kōgon, who was supported by the Kamakura Shogunate[1].

3. The Genkō War, which lasted from 1331 to 1333, was essentially a struggle between Emperor Go-Daigo's supporters and the Kamakura Shogunate[8].

4. This conflict ended with the fall of the Kamakura Shogunate in 1333, when Nitta Yoshisada, one of Go-Daigo's allies, successfully besieged Kamakura[1][6].

5. The Genkō era and the associated war marked a turning point in Japanese history, as it briefly restored direct imperial rule before the establishment of the Ashikaga Shogunate[6].

It's worth noting that this period was part of a larger struggle known as the Nanboku-chō period, where there were competing imperial courts. Emperor Go-Daigo's court in Yoshino was known as the Southern Court, while the Northern Court in Kyoto was supported by the Ashikaga Shogunate[1][4].
