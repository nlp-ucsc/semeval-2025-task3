The construction of Gillette Stadium cost $325 million when it was originally built[2][4][7]. This stadium, which opened in 2002, was privately funded in its entirety, making it unique among NFL stadiums[4][5]. 

Some key points about the stadium's construction and financing:

1. Private funding: Gillette Stadium is the only NFL stadium that was fully funded through private sources, with 100% of the facility, land, and parking costs paid for privately[5].

2. Infrastructure costs: All infrastructure costs were reimbursed to the public by the stadium[5].

3. Original design: The stadium was designed by HOK Sport (now known as Populous) and opened with a capacity of 68,000 seats[2].

4. Budget efficiency: The project was completed both on time and $8 million under budget, thanks to creative solutions implemented by the construction team[1].

It's worth noting that since its initial construction, the Kraft family has continued to invest in the stadium:

- In the first 20 years after opening, they invested an additional $300 million in various enhancements[3].
- Recently, a major renovation project costing $250 million was completed in 2023, which included significant upgrades to the north end of the stadium[3][4][6][9].

These ongoing investments demonstrate the commitment to keeping Gillette Stadium modern and competitive among NFL venues, with total investments far exceeding the initial construction cost.
