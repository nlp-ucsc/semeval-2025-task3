The Isolobodon portoricensis is an extinct species of rodent that once inhabited Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Capromyidae, which includes various species of Caribbean rodents commonly known as hutias. Hutias are medium-sized, ground-dwelling rodents that were once abundant in the Caribbean but have significantly declined due to habitat loss, predation by introduced species, and other environmental factors. The Isolobodon portoricensis is one of several extinct hutia species that have been studied to understand the ecological history and biodiversity of the region. 

Hutias are distinct from other rodents due to their stocky build, short tails, and adapted teeth. They primarily feed on leaves, fruits, and bark, playing an essential role in seed dispersal and forest regeneration. Despite their historical abundance, the introduction of invasive species such as rats, cats, and mongooses has led to the extinction of many hutia species, including the Isolobodon portoricensis. Conservation efforts are currently in place to protect the remaining hutia species and their habitats.
