The two Rhodesias, Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia, were British colonies in Southern Africa. Here's how they correspond to current countries:

- **Northern Rhodesia** is now known as **Zambia**. It gained independence from Britain in 1964.

- **Southern Rhodesia** became **Rhodesia** after gaining internal self-government in 1970. However, this move was controversial and not internationally recognized. Southern Rhodesia later transitioned to majority rule, and in 1979, it was renamed **Zimbabwe-Rhodesia** briefly before officially becoming **Zimbabwe** in 1980.

So, in summary:

- **Zambia** corresponds to Northern Rhodesia.
- **Zimbabwe** corresponds to Southern Rhodesia.
