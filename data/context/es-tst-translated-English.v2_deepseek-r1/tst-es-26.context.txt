In Greek mythology, the Aloadae (Greek: Ἀλωάδαι) were a group of giants and the sons of the sea-god Poseidon and Iphidemia. Their names were:

1. Otus (Ὦτος)
2. Ephialtes (Ἐφιάλτης)

They were known for their enormous size and strength. The Aloadae were said to have attempted to storm Mount Olympus and overthrow the Olympian gods, an act known as the "Gigantomachy." However, they were defeated with the help of Apollo and Artemis. Otus and Ephialtes were eventually killed by Apollo for their sacrilege and hubris.

Their story serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of hubris and the futility of challenging the power of the gods.
