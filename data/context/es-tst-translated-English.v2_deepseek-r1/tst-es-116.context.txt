Fuligo septica, commonly known as the "dog vomit slime mold," typically has a bright yellow to orange color when it's in its plasmodial stage. As it matures and begins to form its spores, it can change to a more lung-gray or brownish color. So, depending on its stage of development, Fuligo septica can appear yellow, orange, or grayish-brown.
