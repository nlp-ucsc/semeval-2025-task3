Pythagoras, the ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician, is believed to have been married to a woman named Theano. Little is known about her life with certainty, but she is often associated with being a philosopher in her own right and possibly a teacher. Some accounts suggest that she might have contributed to the development of the Pythagorean philosophy, although details about her specific contributions are scarce and often speculative. Theano is also sometimes noted for her involvement in raising their children and continuing Pythagoras's teachings after his death. However, historical records about her are limited and not always reliable, so much of what we know remains uncertain.
