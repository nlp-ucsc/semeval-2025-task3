The alliance between Sparta, Athens, and Ptolemy II of Egypt, facilitated by the Athenian statesman and general Creonides, was formed around 266 BCE. This alliance was established during the Chremonidean War. The war itself took place approximately between 267 and 261 BCE, as Athens and Sparta, with support from Ptolemy II, sought to counter Macedonian dominance in Greece. Creonides played a significant role in organizing this coalition against the Macedonian kingdom.
