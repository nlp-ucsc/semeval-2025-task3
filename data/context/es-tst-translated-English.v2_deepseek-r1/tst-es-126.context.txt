Carlo Gozzi, an 18th-century Italian playwright and one of the key figures in the development of commedia dell'arte, wrote a treatise called "The Memoirs of Carlo Gozzi." In this work, he discusses the dramatic themes he believes are fundamental to storytelling and theater. According to Gozzi, there are three primary dramatic themes:

1. Love
2. Ambition
3. Avarice

These three themes, Gozzi argued, form the basis of all dramatic narratives and are central to understanding human nature and conflict in storytelling. His ideas about these themes were influential in the context of commedia dell'arte and continue to be referenced in discussions about dramatic theory.
