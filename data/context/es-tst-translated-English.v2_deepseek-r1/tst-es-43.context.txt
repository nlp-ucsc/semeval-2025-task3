As of my last update in July 2024, there is no known dwarf planet named "Chaos" in our Solar System. It's possible you may be referring to a smaller celestial body or a term from a different context, such as a moon or an exoplanet. If "Chaos" is a recently discovered object or part of a specific study, I recommend checking the latest astronomical databases or publications for the most accurate information. Let me know if you have more details!
