The global mountain-forming phase during which the Alps were primarily formed is called the **Alpine orogeny**. This orogeny occurred during the Cenozoic Era, specifically from about 65 million years ago to around 2.5 million years ago, with the most intense phase happening during the Miocene epoch, roughly 20-5 million years ago. The Alpine orogeny was a result of the collision between the Eurasian and African tectonic plates, which pushed up the Alps and other mountain ranges in Europe.
