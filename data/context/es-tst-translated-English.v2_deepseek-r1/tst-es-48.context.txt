The terms "oval" and "ovoid" are often used to describe shapes that resemble eggs or ovals, but there is a subtle difference between them.

An **oval** is a two-dimensional shape that resembles a squashed circle. It is symmetric along its major and minor axes. In geometry, an oval can be a variety of shapes, including the ellipse, which is a more precise mathematical term for a curve on a plane surrounding two focal points such that the sum of the distances to the two focal points is constant for every point on the curve. Ovals can also be more informal and not strictly ellipses.

An **ovoid**, on the other hand, is a three-dimensional shape that resembles an egg. It is a surface of revolution generated by rotating an ovals around one of its axes. The ovoid is similar to a sphere but elongated along one axis, giving it a teardrop-like appearance. Ovoids are commonly seen in nature, such as in the shape of some fruits, and are also used in various design and architectural contexts.

### Summary:
- **Oval**: Two-dimensional, symmetric shape resembling a squashed circle, can encompass various forms including ellipses.
- **Ovoid**: Three-dimensional shape resembling an egg, created by rotating an oval around one of its axes.

While both terms are similar, the key distinction lies in their dimensions and the specific shapes they describe.
