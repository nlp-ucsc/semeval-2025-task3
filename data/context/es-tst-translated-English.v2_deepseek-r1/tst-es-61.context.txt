The artistic movement that popularized the use of basic collage art techniques in the 20th century was **Cubism**. 

Cubism, pioneered by artists like **Pablo Picasso** and **Georges Braque** around 1912, introduced collage elements into fine art. They incorporated newspaper clippings, paper, and other materials into their paintings, breaking away from traditional techniques and expanding the definition of art. This innovation paved the way for various avant-garde movements and remains influential in modern art.
