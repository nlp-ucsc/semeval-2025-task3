The Autonomous Province of Korçë, also known as the Republic of Korçë, was established in 1917 during World War I. It existed as an autonomous entity until it was dissolved in 1920. This period was marked by efforts to establish a self-governing region for the local Albanian and Aromanian (Vlach) populations, though its autonomy was short-lived and eventually reincorporated into Albania.
