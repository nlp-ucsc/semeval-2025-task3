The Emergent Church and the Evangelical movements are both Christian movements, but they have distinct differences in their theology, practices, and approaches to faith. Here's a breakdown of the key differences:

### 1. **Origins and Historical Context**
   - **Evangelical Movement**: The modern Evangelical movement has its roots in the 18th-century revivals, such as the Great Awakening, and is closely tied to the Reformation. It emphasizes the authority of the Bible, personal conversion, and the importance of spreading the Gospel.
   - **Emergent Church**: Emerging in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the Emergent Church (often referred to as the Emerging Church) arose as a response to the perceived shortcomings of evangelicalism. It seeks to engage postmodern culture and critique traditional church practices.

### 2. **Theology and Doctrine**
   - **Evangelical Movement**: Evangelicals generally hold to orthodox Christian doctrine, including the authority and inerrancy of the Bible, the Trinity, the virgin birth of Christ, substitutionary atonement, and the bodily resurrection of Christ. They emphasize the importance of personal salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.
   - **Emergent Church**: The Emergent Church tends to be more diverse and less tied to specific doctrinal formulations. It often emphasizes orthopraxy (right living) over orthodoxy (right belief) and encourages dialogue and openness to various theological perspectives, sometimes leading to critiques of traditional evangelical doctrines.

### 3. **Approach to Scripture**
   - **Evangelical Movement**: Evangelicals typically affirm the inerrancy and infallibility of the Bible, viewing it as the authoritative Word of God. They often emphasize the importance of Bible study and the literal interpretation of Scripture.
   - **Emergent Church**: While Emergent leaders affirm the importance of Scripture, they may interpret it in a more narrative and contextual way, often emphasizing the cultural and historical setting of the text. There is a greater willingness to question traditional interpretations and to engage in hermeneutical dialogue.

### 4. **Worship and Practice**
   - **Evangelical Movement**: Evangelical worship is often characterized by contemporary music, expository preaching, and an emphasis on personal conversion experiences. The focus is on the individualâ€™s relationship with Christ and the importance of evangelism.
   - **Emergent Church**: The Emergent Church often engages in more eclectic and creative worship practices, incorporating ancient traditions, liturgical elements, and artistic expressions. There is an emphasis on community and authenticity in worship, and a critique of what is seen as over-individualism in evangelical worship.

### 5. **Engagement with Culture**
   - **Evangelical Movement**: Evangelicals have historically sought to engage culture with the Gospel, often through evangelism and social activism. However, there has sometimes been a tension between cultural engagement and cultural separation, especially in more fundamentalist streams.
   - **Emergent Church**: The Emergent Church emphasizes the importance of incarnational mission, seeking to live out the Gospel within the culture rather than simply trying to convert people. There is a critique of what is seen as a confrontational or adversarial approach to culture in some evangelical circles.

### 6. **Ecclesiology**
   - **Evangelical Movement**: Evangelicals typically affirm a more institutional understanding of the church, with an emphasis on formal structures, denominations, and leadership roles. There is often a strong emphasis on church growth and church planting.
   - **Emergent Church**: The Emergent Church often critiques the institutional church, advocating for a more relational and decentralized understanding of church. There is an emphasis on community, relational networks, and informal gatherings, often under the banner of "house churches" or "simple churches."

### 7. **Missiology and Evangelism**
   - **Evangelical Movement**: Evangelicals place a strong emphasis on personal evangelism and the importance of verbally sharing the Gospel with unbelievers. Missions are often focused on converting individuals to Christianity.
   - **Emergent Church**: The Emergent Church emphasizes a more holistic understanding of mission, which includes social justice, community development, and living out the Gospel in tangible ways. There is a critique of what is seen as a reductionist approach to evangelism in some evangelical circles.

### 8. ** Views on Social Justice**
   - **Evangelical Movement**: While many evangelicals are involved in social justice, there has historically been a tension between personal evangelism and social action. Some sectors of evangelicalism have been criticized for prioritizing individual salvation over social justice.
   - **Emergent Church**: The Emergent Church places a strong emphasis on social justice and caring for the poor, often viewing this as an integral part of the Gospel. There is a critique of what is seen as evangelicalism's neglect of social justice in favor of individualistic religion.

### 9. **Criticisms and Controversies**
   - **Evangelical Movement**: Evangelicalism has faced criticism for its association with political conservatism, its sometimes legalistic approach to Christian living, and its emphasis on propositional truth over lived experience.
   - **Emergent Church**: The Emergent Church has faced criticism for what some see as a lack of doctrinal clarity, an overemphasis on experience at the expense of truth, and a drift towards theological liberalism.

### 10. **Key Figures**
   - **Evangelical Movement**: Key figures include Billy Graham, John Stott, and Tim Keller.
   - **Emergent Church**: Key figures include Brian McLaren, Tony Jones, Doug Pagitt, and Shane Claiborne.

In summary, while both movements share a commitment to following Jesus and spreading the Gospel, the Evangelical movement tends to emphasize doctrinal clarity, personal conversion, and institutional church structures, while the Emergent Church emphasizes cultural engagement, relational community, and a more holistic understanding of mission and social justice.
