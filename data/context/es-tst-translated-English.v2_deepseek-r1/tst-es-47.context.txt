The boiling point of DOT 4 brake fluid varies depending on the specific formulation and whether it's wet or dry. Generally, DOT 4 brake fluid has a minimum boiling point of around 230째C (446째F) when it's new (dry condition). However, when it's been in use and has absorbed some moisture (wet condition), the boiling point can drop significantly, typically to around 140째C (284째F). It's important to note that the actual boiling point can differ slightly between brands, so it's always a good idea to check the specifications provided by the manufacturer. Additionally, DOT 4 brake fluid is hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture over time, which can lower its boiling point and overall performance. Regular maintenance, including fluid changes, is crucial to ensure the safety and efficiency of your braking system.
