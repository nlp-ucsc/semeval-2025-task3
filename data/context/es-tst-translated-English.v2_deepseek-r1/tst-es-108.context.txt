Pierre Dukan, the French dietitian and author of the Dukan Diet, faced professional consequences due to ethical violations. He was expelled from the French medical board in 2014. This action was taken after he was found guilty of violating medical ethics, specifically for marketing his diet products in a way that was deemed inappropriate and unethical by the medical community.
