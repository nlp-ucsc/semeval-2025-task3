Geoffroi de Villehardouin was a medieval French knight and historian, best known for his chronicle of the Fourth Crusade. He originated from Villehardouin, a village in the Champagne region of France. His full name often includes "de Villehardouin," which indicates his place of origin. He was born around 1160 and participated in the Fourth Crusade, which took place from 1202 to 1204. After the crusade, he served as a marshal in the Latin Empire, which was established in Constantinople after the fall of the Byzantine Empire.

Villehardouin's work, *The Conquest of Constantinople*, is one of the most important primary sources for understanding the Fourth Crusade and its aftermath. His account provides detailed insights into the events and motivations of the crusaders, making him a significant figure in medieval historiography.
