A **retronym** is a term coined to describe a phrase created because an existing term has become inadequate due to changes in technology or society. It's used to distinguish the original meaning of a term from a newer concept that has emerged. Retronyms often involve adding an adjective to a noun that was previously unmodified.

### Examples:
1. **Acoustic Guitar** – Before the invention of electric guitars, guitars were simply called "guitars." The term "acoustic guitar" became necessary to differentiate it from electric guitars.
2. **Landline** – With the advent of mobile phones, the term "landline" emerged to distinguish traditional phone lines from mobile phones.
3. **Film Camera** – The rise of digital cameras made it necessary to refer to older cameras as "film cameras."
4. **Manual Transmission** – As automatic transmissions became common, "manual transmission" distinguished the older, non-automatic type.
5. **Wired Internet** – With the introduction of Wi-Fi, "wired internet" became the retronym for internet via cables.

Retronyms highlight how language evolves to accommodate new technologies and cultural shifts.
