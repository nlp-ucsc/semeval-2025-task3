The genus **Abrus** consists of flowering plants in the pea family (**Fabaceae**, previously Leguminosae). Species within this genus are often climbing plants or herbaceous vines, commonly known as "crimson clerodendrum" or "Jewâ€™s marbles," though the latter name might refer more specifically to Abrus precatorius. 

One of the most notable species is **Abrus precatorius**, commonly called **rosary pea** or **crab's eye**. This plant is native to tropical regions and is known for its seeds, which are brightly colored and have been used in jewelry and as percussion instruments. However, the seeds contain **abrin**, an extremely toxic compound similar to ricin, making them highly dangerous.

Other species in the genus include:

- **Abrus balduwinii** (Baldwin's abortion)
- **Abrus canescens**
- **Abrus laevigatus**
- **Abrus longibracteatus**
- **Abrus melanospermus**
- **Abrus parviflorus**
- **Abrus precatorius** (most widely known)
- **Abrus schimperi**
- **Abrus sphaerocarpus**
- **Abrus subfuscus**

These plants are often found in warm, tropical, and subtropical regions around the world. They are known for their twining habit and small, usually purple or pink flowers. However, due to the toxicity of their seeds, plants in this genus should be handled with caution.
