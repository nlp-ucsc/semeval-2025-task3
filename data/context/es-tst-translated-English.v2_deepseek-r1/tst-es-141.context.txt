As of my last update in July 2024, I don't have specific information on Magnar Solberg's participation in the Olympic Games. It's possible that he may have competed in shooting, as several athletes with the name Magnar Solberg are associated with that sport, but I cannot confirm the exact number of times he participated or the events he competed in. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking the latest official Olympic records or reliable sports history sources.
