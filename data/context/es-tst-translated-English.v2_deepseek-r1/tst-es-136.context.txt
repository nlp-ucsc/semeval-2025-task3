The commander of the British forces during the Battle of Long Island, also known as the Battle of Brooklyn, was General William Howe and his brother Admiral Richard Howe. The main strategy employed by the British was to outflank the Continental Army led by General George Washington. They utilized a superior naval presence and executed a strategic maneuver around the American defensive lines, capturing key high ground at Brooklyn Heights and forcing the Continental Army to retreat to Manhattan. This battle marked a significant British victory in the early stages of the American Revolutionary War.
