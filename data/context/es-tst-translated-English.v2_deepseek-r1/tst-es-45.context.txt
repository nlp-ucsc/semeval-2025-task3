Queen's College, Cork, which was established in 1845 as part of the Queen's University of Ireland, played a significant role in Irish education during the 19th century. However, with the establishment of the National University of Ireland (NUI) in 1908, Queen's College, Cork, along with Queen's College, Galway, and Queen's College, Belfast, became constituent colleges of the new federal university. In 1910, Queen's College, Cork, was renamed University College, Cork (UCC), and it has since thrived as one of Ireland's leading universities. UCC maintains its historic campus and continues to contribute significantly to education and research.
