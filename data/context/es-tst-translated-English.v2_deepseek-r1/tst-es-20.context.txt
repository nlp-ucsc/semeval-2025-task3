Observational cosmology is a branch of astronomy focused on understanding the universe through direct observations of its structure, evolution, and composition. It examines phenomena such as the cosmic microwave background radiation, distant galaxies, supernovae, black holes, and large-scale structures to infer the universe's properties, like its age, expansion rate, and matter content. By analyzing data from telescopes and spacecraft, observational cosmologists test theories and models, such as the Big Bang and dark energy, to refine our understanding of cosmic history and dynamics.
