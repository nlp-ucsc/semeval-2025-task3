The Alemanni, also known as the Alamanni, were a confederation of Germanic tribes that lived north of the Alps and east of the Rhine River during the late Roman Empire and the early medieval period. The name "Alemanni" is thought to derive from the Germanic word *al(a)mani, meaning "all men" or "common men," possibly indicating that they were a collective or alliance of various tribes rather than a single, unified group.

The Alemanni first emerged in the 3rd century AD, during the crisis that affected the Roman Empire. They frequently raided and clashed with the Romans, and by the 4th and 5th centuries AD, they had established themselves in the region between the Rhine, Danube, and Alps. They played a significant role in the history of Europe during the Migration Period, contributing to the fall of the Western Roman Empire.

After the fall of the Roman Empire, the Alemanni began to settle in the territories they had once raided. They established their own duchies and kingdoms in what is now modern-day Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and parts of France. The Alemannic culture blended elements of their Germanic heritage with the Roman influences from the areas they had settled in.

In the 6th century, the Alemanni came under the influence of the Frankish Empire, particularly under the Merovingian dynasty. They maintained a degree of autonomy, but their territories eventually became part of the Carolingian Empire in the 8th and 9th centuries. Over time, the distinct identity of the Alemanni became subsumed into the broader medieval constructs of the Holy Roman Empire and the emerging nation-states of Germany and France.

The Alemanni are notable for their contributions to the development of medieval European culture, language, and politics. They also left a lasting legacy in the regions where they settled, particularly in the Alemannic dialects of German still spoken in parts of Switzerland, Germany, and Austria today.
