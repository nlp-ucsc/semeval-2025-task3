Pleiotropy in genetics refers to a single gene that influences multiple, seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits. This means that one gene can affect several different characteristics of an organism. For example, a single gene might influence both eye color and hearing ability, or flower color and plant height. This concept challenges the earlier belief that one gene controls one trait, as it shows that genes can have widespread effects on an organism's phenotype.
