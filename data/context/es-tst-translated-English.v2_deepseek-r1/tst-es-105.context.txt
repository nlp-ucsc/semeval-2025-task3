The so-called "French paradox" in nutritional theory refers to the observation that despite consuming a diet relatively high in saturated fats and cholesterol, the French population tends to have a lower incidence of heart disease compared to other countries, such as the United States. This paradox has been attributed to various factors, including the consumption of red wine, which contains antioxidants like resveratrol; a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; and the practice of eating smaller, more balanced meals. Additionally, the French cultural emphasis on leisurely dining and the enjoyment of food may play a role in better digestion and overall dietary habits.
