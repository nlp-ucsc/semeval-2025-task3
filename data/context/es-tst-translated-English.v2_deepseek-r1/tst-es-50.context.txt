In an adult human, each orbital cavity is formed by seven bones. These bones work together to create the structure that houses and protects the eye. The bones involved are:

1. Frontal bone
2. Maxilla bone
3. Zygoma (or zygomatic bone)
4. Lacrimal bone
5. Palatine bone
6. Sphenoid bone
7. Ethmoid bone

These bones provide the structural framework for the orbit, which supports the eye and its associated tissues.
