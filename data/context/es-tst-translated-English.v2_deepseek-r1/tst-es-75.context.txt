That's interesting! The original title *Tuck Everlasting* could be translated literally as "Los Tuck Eternos" or "La eternidad de los Tuck." The Spanish translation *El misterio de los Tuck* ("The Mystery of the Tucks") shifts the focus from the eternal nature of the Tuck family to the mysterious aspects of their secret and their existence. This highlights the magical and secretive elements of the story, which are central to the plot. It's a clever way to convey the enchanting and intriguing vibe of the film to Spanish-speaking audiences.
