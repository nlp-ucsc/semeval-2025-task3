One of the main causes of type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance, where the body's cells become less responsive to insulin, leading to improper regulation of blood sugar. This is often driven by factors such as obesity, physical inactivity, and a diet high in sugar and unhealthy fats. Over time, the pancreas may also produce less insulin, exacerbating the condition.
