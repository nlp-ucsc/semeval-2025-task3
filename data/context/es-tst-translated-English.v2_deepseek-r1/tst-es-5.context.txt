The Second Council of Nicaea, held in 787, primarily addressed the issue of iconoclasm, affirming the veneration of images. It canonized the use of sacred images and restored them in churches. 

As for disciplinary measures, the council did not primarily focus on punitive actions but rather on doctrinal clarification. However, the council did affirm the validity of previous ecumenical councils and their decisions, including disciplinary measures from the earlier councils like the Council of Chalcedon (451 AD), which had its own set of 30 canons. Therefore, if we consider the reaffirmation of previous councils' decisions, there would be numerous disciplinary measures, but specific new ones from 787 were minimal.

The exact number of new disciplinary measures approved at the Second Council of Nicaea is not well-documented as its primary focus was on restoring images rather than establishing new disciplinary actions. Therefore, while the council reinforced existing regulations, it didn't introduce a significant number of new measures.
