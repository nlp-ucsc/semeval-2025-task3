The spade-toothed whale, also known as Mesoplodon traversii, is an extremely rare and poorly understood species of beaked whale. As of my last update in July 2024, the remains of this whale have been found in the oceans surrounding New Zealand and the Southern Hemisphere. Specifically, there have been a few reported sightings and strandings in regions such as New Zealand, the Chatham Islands, and other parts of the southern Pacific Ocean.

It's important to note that the spade-toothed whale was considered one of the most enigmatic cetaceans due to the scarcity of sightings and specimens. However, in 2010, a complete skeleton was found in a New Zealand forest, providing significant insights into this elusive species. This discovery, along with a few other documented encounters, has helped scientists learn more about its habitat and distribution.

If you're interested in more recent findings, I recommend checking the latest scientific publications or updates from marine biology research institutions.
