Mutoscopes were popular during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Their heyday was from approximately the 1890s through the 1920s. They were a common form of entertainment, particularly in public places like amusement parks, arcades, and train stations, where people would insert a coin to watch short, often humorous or risqu√©, films. The introduction of sound in films during the late 1920s and the rise of home entertainment options like television gradually led to their decline in popularity.
