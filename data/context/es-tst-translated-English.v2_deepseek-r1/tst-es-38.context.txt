International Klein Blue, often abbreviated as IKB, is a shade of blue pigment developed by the French artist Yves Klein in collaboration with the chemist Edouard Adam in the late 1950s. The name "Klein Blue" comes from the artist himself, Yves Klein, who was particularly fascinated by the color blue and its emotional and symbolic significance.

Yves Klein was known for his monochromatic paintings, which he believed could evoke deep emotional and transcendental experiences. To achieve this, he sought a blue that was both rich and vibrant, with a high level of ultramarine pigmentation. He experimented with various pigments until he and Edouard Adam discovered a unique mixture that was both stable and long-lasting, which became known as International Klein Blue.

IKB is characterized by its deep, saturated blue tone, often described as being almost velvety in texture when applied to a surface. It became one of Klein's signature elements and a defining feature of his artistic style, particularly in his famous monochrome blue paintings. The precise formulation of IKB is still protected by the Yves Klein estate, ensuring that only authorized artworks or reproductions use this exact shade, thereby maintaining its exclusivity and artistic integrity.
