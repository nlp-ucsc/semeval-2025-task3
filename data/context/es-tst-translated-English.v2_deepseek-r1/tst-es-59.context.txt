Bahram I was a Sassanid King of Kings of Iran who ruled from 276 to 277 AD. He was the son of Shapur I, one of the most powerful Sassanid emperors, and ascended to the throne after the death of his brother, Hormizd I. Bahram I is notable for his short but significant reign, during which he faced challenges from both external and internal forces.

One of the key events during his reign was the persecution of Manichaeism, a religious movement founded by Mani. Bahram I, under the influence of the Zoroastrian priesthood, saw Manichaeism as a threat to the established religion and ordered the execution of Mani. This marked a turning point in the history of Manichaeism, leading to its spread outside the Sassanid Empire.

Despite his short reign, Bahram I's actions had lasting impacts on the religious landscape of the region. His efforts to strengthen Zoroastrianism and suppress other religions reflected the broader Sassanid policy of promoting a unified religious identity to consolidate power.

Overall, Bahram I's reign, though brief, was significant in the religious and political history of the Sassanid Empire.
