As of the most recent available information, Real Madrid Castilla, which is the reserve team of Real Madrid, has had several presidents throughout its history. However, the specific number of presidents is not widely documented, as this information might not be as publicly emphasized as it is for the first team. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking the latest sources or the official Real Madrid website.
