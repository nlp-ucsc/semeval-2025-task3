The highest hill in Lithuania is Aukštojas Hill, which is approximately 294 meters (965 feet) above sea level. The second highest hill is Dainavos Kalnas (also known as Dainava Hill), which stands at around 276 meters (906 feet) above sea level. Both of these hills are located in the Šeškinė forest, near the village of Aukštojas, in the Utena County of eastern Lithuania. These are part of the Baltic Uplands, which cover a significant part of the country.

In Lithuania, these high points are not mountainous but rather elevated areas of land that rise above the generally low-lying terrain. Despite their relatively modest heights by global standards, they hold geographical significance within the country.
