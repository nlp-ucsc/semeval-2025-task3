The horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) is native to the Balkan Peninsula in southeastern Europe. Its natural range includes countries such as Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, and Serbia. It typically grows in the mountains at moderate to high elevations where the climate is temperate. The species has been widely introduced and cultivated in many other parts of the world, including Europe, North America, and other regions, for its ornamental value and edible seeds (chestnuts).
