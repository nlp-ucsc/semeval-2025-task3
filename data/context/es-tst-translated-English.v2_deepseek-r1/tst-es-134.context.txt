As of the most recent data available up to July 2024, Mileto, a town in Calabria, Italy, has been experiencing a trend of population decline. This is part of a broader pattern observed in many rural areas of Southern Italy, where factors such as aging populations, low birth rates, and migration to larger cities or other countries contribute to the decrease in resident numbers. While specific statistics can vary slightly from year to year, the overall trajectory has been one of gradual population reduction. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, consulting the latest reports from the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) or local administrative sources is recommended.
