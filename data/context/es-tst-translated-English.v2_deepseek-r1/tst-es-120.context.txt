The Pontifical Gregorian University, also known as the Gregorian University, was founded in 1551 by Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). It was originally established as the Collegium Romanum and was later renamed in honor of Pope Gregory XIII, who significantly contributed to its development in 1584. The university is one of the oldest and most prestigious pontifical universities in Rome, Italy, and is known for its academic excellence, particularly in the fields of theology, philosophy, and canon law.
