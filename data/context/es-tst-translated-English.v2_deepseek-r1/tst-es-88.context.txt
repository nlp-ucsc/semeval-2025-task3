As of my last update in July 2024, there is no widely recognized or officially confirmed information suggesting that Choe Ryong-hae is related to North Korea's current leader, Kim Jong Un. Choe Ryong-hae has held various significant positions within the North Korean government and the Workers' Party of Korea, and while his family background might include connections within the broader political elite, a direct familial link to Kim Jong Un is not established in publicly available sources. It's important to note that detailed personal information about North Korean political figures is often limited and sometimes not disclosed to the public.
