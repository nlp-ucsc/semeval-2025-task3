During the Nazi occupation, the government-in-exile of Edvard Beneš was primarily located in **London, United Kingdom**. After the occupation of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany in 1939, Beneš, who was the President of Czechoslovakia at the time, fled to London. There, he established the **Czechoslovak Government-in-Exile**, which was recognized by the United Kingdom and other Allied powers as the legitimate government of Czechoslovakia. From London, Beneš and his government worked to coordinate resistance efforts, maintain international support, and prepare for the post-war restoration of Czechoslovakia. This government-in-exile played a significant role in the eventual liberation of Czechoslovakia from Nazi rule.
