Petr Nečas resigned as the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic in 2013 due to a political scandal involving his chief of staff, Jana Nagyová. Nagyová was charged with corruption and abuse of power, including ordering illegal surveillance. The scandal led to the collapse of the government coalition and Nečas's subsequent resignation on June 17, 2013.
