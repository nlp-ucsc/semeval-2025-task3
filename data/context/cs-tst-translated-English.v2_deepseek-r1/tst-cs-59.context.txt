I'm not familiar with information about the poems titled "Edison" and "The Signal of the Time," including their authorship. My training data includes a wide range of information up until July 2024, but I may not have specific details on every literary work, especially if they are less well-known or were published after my knowledge cutoff. If these poems are from a specific collection or by a particular poet, providing more context might help in identifying the author.
