The girl who was allegedly murdered by Leopold Hilsner in Polná was Anežka Hrůzová. This case, known as the "Hilsner Affair," occurred in 1899 and became notorious in Austria-Hungary, particularly for its antisemitic overtones. Leopold Hilsner was a Jewish man who was accused and convicted of murdering Hrůzová, a young Christian woman. The case drew widespread attention and was later used as a pretext for antisemitic attacks and agitation in the region.
