The city of Chomutov, now known as Chomutov, was conquered by the Hussites in the 15th century. Specifically, this took place during the Hussite Wars, which occurred in the early 15th century. The Hussites, followers of Jan Hus, were involved in a series of conflicts with both the Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire. Chomutov, located in what is now the Czech Republic, was one of the cities affected by these wars. The exact date of its conquest by the Hussites would be around the 1420s, as this was a period of significant Hussite military activity.
