The attack carried out by paratroopers Jozef Gabčík and Jan Kubiš was aimed at Reinhard Heydrich, a high-ranking Nazi official and the Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia. This operation, known as Operation Anthropoid, occurred on May 27, 1942, in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Heydrich was a key figure in the Nazi regime and played a significant role in the implementation of the Holocaust. The assassination was one of the most notable acts of resistance against the Nazis during World War II.
