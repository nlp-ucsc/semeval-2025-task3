The Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was established in March 1939, following the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. During this period, the region was effectively under German control, and there was no president in the traditional sense. Instead, the territory was governed by a Reich Protector appointed by Adolf Hitler.

The first Reich Protector was Konstantin von Neurath, who served from March 1939 until September 1941. He was succeeded by Reinhard Heydrich, who held the position until his assassination in June 1942. After Heydrich's death, Ernst Kaltenbrunner and Karl Hermann Frank served in various capacities related to the administration of the Protectorate until the end of World War II in May 1945.

So, during the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, the head of the government was the Reich Protector, and there was no president as such. The last president of Czechoslovakia before the establishment of the Protectorate was Emil HÃ¡cha, who served from November 1938 until the German occupation in March 1939.
