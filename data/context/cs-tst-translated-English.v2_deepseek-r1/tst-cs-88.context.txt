The oldest Prague railway station located on Hybernská Street is called "Praha hlavní nádraží" or "Prague Main Railway Station." However, it's important to note that the station has been remodelled and extended over the years. The original station on this site, which dates back to the mid-19th century, was known as "Praha státní nádraží" (Prague State Station) and was built when the railway connection between Prague and Vienna was established in 1848. Over time, the station has undergone various transformations, with the current main station being a significant transportation hub in the city.
