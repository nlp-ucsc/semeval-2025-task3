In the Czech Republic, the period from the end of the Second World War to Victorious February is generally referred to as the "Third Resistance" or "Third Republic." However, the specific term " Victorious February " (Czech: "Vítězný únor") carries distinct connotations. It refers to the events of February 1948 when the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, with support from the Soviet Union, seized power in a coup d'état. This marked the end of the post-war democratic period and the beginning of a communist regime in Czechoslovakia. The term highlights the Communist Party's portrayal of the takeover as a "victory" for socialism, despite its undemocratic nature and the subsequent suppression of political opposition.
