Pern≈°tejn Castle in the Czech Republic is primarily built in the Gothic architectural style, with some Romanesque elements, particularly in its earlier structures. However, over the centuries, especially during the Renaissance and Baroque periods, the castle underwent significant alterations and expansions, which introduced elements from these later architectural styles. Despite these changes, the castle retains its strong Gothic character, making it one of the most well-preserved Gothic castles in Central Europe.
