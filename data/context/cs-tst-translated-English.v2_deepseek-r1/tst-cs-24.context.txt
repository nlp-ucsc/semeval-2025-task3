The 2023 FIVB Beach Volleyball World Championships took place in Tlaxcala, Mexico, but as of my knowledge cutoff in July 2024, the event had not yet concluded. Typically, the World Championships are held every two years, and the last one prior to that would have been in 2022. Therefore, I don't have information on the 2023 champions. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking the latest sports news updates or the FIVB's official website.
