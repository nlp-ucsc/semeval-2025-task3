The church in Kutná Hora you're referring to is likely the **St. Barbara's Church** (Chrám svaté Barbory). It is dedicated to **Saint Barbara**, a 3rd-century martyr and the patron saint of miners, which is particularly fitting given Kutná Hora's historical significance as a major silver-mining town. The church is a renowned Gothic landmark in the Czech Republic and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
