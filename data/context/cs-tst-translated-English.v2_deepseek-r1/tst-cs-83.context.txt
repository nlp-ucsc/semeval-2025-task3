The Rožmberks, also known as the Rosenbergs, were a powerful and influential noble family in Bohemia, which is now part of the Czech Republic. They were one of the most prominent families in the Kingdom of Bohemia during the Gothic and Renaissance periods.

### Origins:
The family's history dates back to the 13th century. The name Rožmberk is derived from their castle, Rožmberk nad Vltavou, which is located in South Bohemia along the Vltava River. The castle served as their ancestral seat.

### Rise to Prominence:
The Rožmberks gained significant influence and wealth through strategic marriages, military service, and political alliances. They were known for their vast estates, which included numerous castles and towns across Bohemia. They were also patrons of the arts and architecture, contributing to the cultural development of the region.

### Notable Members:
- **Peter I of Rožmberk**: One of the most notable members of the family, he served as the High Treasurer of Bohemia and played a crucial role in the political and military affairs of the kingdom.
- **Rožmberk Family in the Hussite Wars**: During the 15th-century Hussite Wars, the Rožmberks were generally loyal to the Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Emperor, which sometimes put them at odds with the Hussite movement.
- **Wilhelm of Rožmberk**: A 16th-century member who was a notable military leader and statesman.

### Cultural Contributions:
The Rožmberks were patrons of Gothic architecture and art. They commissioned the construction and renovation of many castles and churches, including their family seat at Rožmberk nad Vltavou, which became a symbol of their power and legacy.

### Decline:
The family's influence began to wane in the late 16th and early 17th centuries due to financial difficulties and political shifts. In 1611, the last male member of the Rožmberk family, Peter Vok of Rožmberk, died without a male heir, leading to the division of their vast estates among other noble families.

### Legacy:
Despite their decline, the Rožmberks left a lasting impact on Bohemia's history, architecture, and culture. Their castles and the towns they founded remain important historical sites, attracting visitors and historians alike.

The story of the Rožmberk family is a testament to the complex and often turbulent history of Bohemia during the medieval and early modern periods.
