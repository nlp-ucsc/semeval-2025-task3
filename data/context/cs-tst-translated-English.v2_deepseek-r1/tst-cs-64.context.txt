The famous battle between France and Russia that took place in 1805 in Moravia is the Battle of Austerlitz. It occurred on December 2, 1805, and is considered one of Napoleon Bonaparte's greatest military victories. Although the battle is named after the nearby village of Austerlitz, it is also sometimes referred to as the Battle of the Three Emperors because the leaders of the opposing forces—Napoleon I of France, Tsar Alexander I of Russia, and Holy Roman Emperor Francis II—were all present on the battlefield. The location is in what is now the Czech Republic, in Central Europe.
