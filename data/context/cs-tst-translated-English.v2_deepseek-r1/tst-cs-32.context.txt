The Czech noblewoman who was the wife of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg. She was born Sophie Chotek on July 1, 1868, in Prague, Bohemia (now the Czech Republic), and married Franz Ferdinand in 1900. Her death alongside her husband in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, is often cited as one of the triggers for the outbreak of World War I.
