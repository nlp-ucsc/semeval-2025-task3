The Sudetenland refers to regions in the Czech Republic that were predominantly inhabited by ethnic Germans before World War II. These areas are located along the borders with Germany and Austria, particularly in the areas now known as the Karlovy Vary, Liberec, Ústí nad Labem, and parts of the Plzeň, South Bohemia, and South Moravia regions. The term gained prominence in the 1930s when the Sudeten German Party sought autonomy and eventually annexation by Nazi Germany, leading to the Munich Agreement in 1938 and the occupation of these territories by Germany. After World War II, the ethnic German population was largely expelled, and the regions were resettled by Czechs and Slovaks.
