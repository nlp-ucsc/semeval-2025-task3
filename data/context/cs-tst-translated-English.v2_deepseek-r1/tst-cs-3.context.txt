In the Czech Republic, uranium mining primarily took place in several locations, most notably:

1. **Jáchymov (Joachimsthal):** Known for its uranium mines, Jáchymov was one of the earliest uranium mining areas in the world. It was a significant source during the Cold War era.

2. **Kovářská:** Located near Jáchymov, this area also had uranium mines contributing to the region's uranium production.

3. **Větrná:** Another uranium mining site in the Czech Republic.

4. **Plasy:** Uranium was mined in the Plasy area, adding to the country's uranium resources.

5. **Brzkov:** This location was also involved in uranium mining activities.

These mining activities were crucial for the country's nuclear energy program and supported other European nations' nuclear energy needs. However, many of these mines have now been decommissioned.
