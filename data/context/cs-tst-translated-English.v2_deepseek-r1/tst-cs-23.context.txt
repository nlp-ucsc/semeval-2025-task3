The city in Bohemia that was built as a fortress of the Hussites in 1420 is **Tábor**. Tábor became one of the key strongholds of the Hussites during the Hussite Wars. It was founded by radical Hussites known as the Taborites, who were led by figures like Jan Žižka. The city was strategically built on a hill and served as a military and religious center for the movement, symbolizing their resistance against the Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire.
