The original Prague University, also known as Charles University, was founded in 1348 by Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia. At its inception, it had four faculties, following the medieval university model:

1. **Faculty of Arts**: This was the largest and most general faculty, providing a foundational education in the liberal arts. It served as the undergraduate faculty and was prerequisite for studies in the higher faculties.

2. **Faculty of Theology**: Specializing in the study of theology and religious doctrine, this faculty prepared students for careers in the church and religious leadership.

3. **Faculty of Law**: Focused on the study of canon law and Roman law, this faculty was essential for the education of future lawyers, judges, and civil servants.

4. **Faculty of Medicine**: Dedicated to the study of medicine and health sciences, this faculty trained physicians and medical practitioners.

These four faculties formed the cornerstone of the university's structure, and this model of organization was typical for universities in medieval Europe. Over time, the university has evolved and expanded, adding new faculties to reflect the changing needs of society and academia.
