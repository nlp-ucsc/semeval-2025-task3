HC Kometa Brno, the hockey club based in Brno, Czech Republic, was originally founded under the name "SK Židenice" in 1920. The name "Kometa" was adopted later, in 1953, when the team was renamed to "Rudá hvězda Brno" (Red Star Brno). The "Kometa" nickname emerged from the sponsor and became the official name over time. Since 1999, the club has been officially known as HC Kometa Brno.
