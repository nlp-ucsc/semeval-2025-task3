The funeral that preceded the closure of Czech universities on November 17, 1939, was that of Jan Opletal, a Czech student who was shot and killed by German soldiers during a anti-Nazi demonstration in Prague on October 28, 1939. His funeral became a symbol of resistance against the Nazi occupation and led to a wave of repression by the German authorities, including the closure of all Czech universities and the execution of nine student leaders. This event is commemorated as International Students' Day.
