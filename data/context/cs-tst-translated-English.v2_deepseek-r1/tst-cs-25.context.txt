You're likely thinking of **Václav Klement**, a Czech entrepreneur and industrialist. However, he is more famously associated with the founding of **Škoda Auto**, not directly with gasoline production. 

For the production and sale of gasoline in the Czech Republic, you might consider individuals associated with petroleum companies. One notable figure is **Jan Antonín Baťa**, though he was primarily known for his role in the Baťa shoe company and related industrial activities. If you have more specific details or context about the company, I might be able to provide more precise information.
