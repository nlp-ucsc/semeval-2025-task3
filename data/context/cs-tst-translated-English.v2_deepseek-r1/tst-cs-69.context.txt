I cannot verify the name of the feature film directed by Jiří Menzel in 1980 based on Bohumil Hrabal's book about a brewery and its manager's family during the First Republic. However, it's possible you might be referring to "Cutting It Short" or "Postřižiny," another film by Menzel based on Hrabal's work. For accurate information, I recommend checking filmographies or reliable sources on Czech cinema.
