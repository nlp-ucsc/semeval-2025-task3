The Elbe River originates in the Krkono≈°e (Giant Mountains) of the Czech Republic. Specifically, it starts near the border with Poland at an elevation of about 1,386 meters (4,547 feet) above sea level. The river then flows northward through the Czech Republic and Germany before emptying into the North Sea near the German city of Cuxhaven.
