Rudé právo was the official daily newspaper of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. It was founded in 1920 and served as the primary propaganda tool for the party, promoting its ideologies and policies. The newspaper played a significant role in disseminating Marxist-Leninist ideas and was a key outlet for the party's political agenda. After the fall of the communist regime in Czechoslovakia in 1989, Rudé právo ceased to be the party's official mouthpiece and eventually ceased publication. Its legacy remains as a symbolic representation of the communist era in Czechoslovakia.
