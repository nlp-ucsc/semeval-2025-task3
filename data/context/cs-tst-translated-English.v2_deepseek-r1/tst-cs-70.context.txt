The future King of Bohemia who was imprisoned at Bezděz Castle in the 13th century was Ottokar II, also known as Ottokar the Great. He was held captive there by his father, King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia, over an inheritance dispute regarding the Duchy of Austria.

Bezděz Castle, located in the Č eskolipsko region (now part of the Liberec Region of the Czech Republic), served as a strategic fortress during the 13th century. Ottokar II faced opposition from his father due to his ambitions and territorial claims, which led to his imprisonment. Despite this, Ottokar later became one of the most powerful rulers of Bohemia, known for his military prowess and extensive territorial acquisitions, earning the nickname "the Great".
