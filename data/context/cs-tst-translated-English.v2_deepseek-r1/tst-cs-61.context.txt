I'm not familiar with the specific name of a Czech leftist artistic association that operated between 1920 and 1930. It's possible that the group in question is not widely known, or it might be referred to by a name that is less commonly used in historical records. If you have any more details or context about this association, such as its focus, key members, or significant works, it might help in identifying the correct group.
