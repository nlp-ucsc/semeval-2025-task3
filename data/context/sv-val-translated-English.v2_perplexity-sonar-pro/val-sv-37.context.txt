The motto of the toy company Takara was 「遊びは文化」(asobi wa bunka), which translates to "playing is culture" in English[3][4]. This motto encapsulated Takara's philosophy and approach to toy-making, emphasizing the cultural significance of play and toys in society.

Takara Co., Ltd. was a prominent Japanese toy company founded in 1955[4]. The company focused on creating traditional toys and board games, and was responsible for developing several globally recognized toy lines and franchises, including:

1. Licca-chan dolls (often referred to as "Japan's Barbie" in Western media)
2. Transformers
3. Beyblade
4. Microman (which formed the basis for the Micronauts toy line)
5. Choro-Q (known as "Penny Racers" internationally)
6. Battle Beasts
7. B-Daman

Takara's commitment to its motto was evident in its diverse range of products that not only provided entertainment but also contributed to children's development and cultural experiences. The company's focus on play as a cultural element likely influenced its approach to toy design and marketing strategies.

In March 2006, Takara merged with another major Japanese toy company, Tomy Company, Ltd., to form Takara Tomy (known as TOMY Company Ltd. in English)[4][10]. While the original Takara company no longer exists as a separate entity, its legacy and influence continue through the merged company's products and philosophy.
