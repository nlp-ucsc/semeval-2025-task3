Gianrico Carofiglio's debut novel is titled "Testimone inconsapevole" in the original Italian language[1][4]. In Swedish, the novel is called "På sannolika skäl"[8].

The novel was first published in Italy in 2002 and was later translated into English with the title "Involuntary Witness" in 2005[1][4][7]. It introduced readers to the character of Guido Guerrieri, a defense lawyer in Bari, Italy, who becomes involved in a case defending a Senegalese immigrant accused of murdering a young boy[1].

This book launched Carofiglio's career as a novelist and became the first in a series featuring Guido Guerrieri. It was well-received and has been adapted into a popular television series in Italy[4]. The novel deals with themes of racism, the Italian judicial system, and personal struggles, drawing on Carofiglio's own experience as an anti-Mafia prosecutor[1][4].
