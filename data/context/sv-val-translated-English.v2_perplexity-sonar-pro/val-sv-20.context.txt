Ningbo cuisine, a distinct part of Zhejiang culinary tradition, is characterized by several key features:

1. Emphasis on seafood: Ningbo's coastal location provides an abundance of fresh seafood, which forms the cornerstone of its cuisine[1][2]. Popular seafood dishes include steamed fish, shrimps in honey sauce, and yellow croaker with pickled mustard greens[2].

2. Cooking techniques: Ningbo cuisine favors methods like steaming, braising, and stewing to preserve the natural flavors of ingredients[1][10]. Quick-frying, stir-frying, and deep-frying are also used[3].

3. Flavor profile: The cuisine is known for being slightly salty while retaining the original freshness and tenderness of ingredients[1][3]. It emphasizes light and delicate flavors, with a subtle use of seasonings[2].

4. Use of local ingredients: Besides seafood, Ningbo cuisine incorporates unique local ingredients like lichen, turtle, and river eel[1][3].

5. Shaoxing wine: This yellow rice wine is a staple ingredient in many Ningbo dishes, used to enhance flavors and add depth[7][9].

6. Preservation techniques: Ningbo is famous for its preserved foods, especially seafood. Qiangxie (preserved crab) is a notable example[5].

7. Seasonal focus: There's a strong emphasis on using seasonal and locally sourced produce[7].

8. Unique dishes: Ningbo is known for its savory tangyuan (dumplings), which differs from the sweet versions found elsewhere in China[2]. Other specialties include Ningbo-style smoked fish fillet, Ningbo wontons, and the "Ningbo 18 Cuts" crab dish[4].

9. Street food culture: Ningbo has a vibrant street food scene, with popular items like stinky tofu, fried noodles, and savory pancakes available at night markets[2].

10. Fusion of tradition and innovation: While preserving traditional flavors, Ningbo cuisine also embraces innovation, sometimes incorporating Western culinary techniques to create unique dishes[5].

This combination of fresh ingredients, delicate flavors, and a mix of traditional and innovative cooking techniques makes Ningbo cuisine a distinctive and cherished part of Chinese culinary culture.
