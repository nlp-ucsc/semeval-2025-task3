The average length of human pregnancy is typically considered to be about 40 weeks or 280 days, measured from the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP)[1][2]. However, recent research suggests that the actual duration of pregnancy can vary significantly, and the traditional 40-week estimate may not be as accurate as once thought.

Here are some key points about the length of human pregnancy:

1. Variation in pregnancy length:
   - A study published in 2013 found that the median time from ovulation to birth was 268 days (38 weeks and 2 days)[3].
   - Even after excluding preterm births, the range of pregnancy length spanned 37 days[3].

2. Factors affecting pregnancy duration:
   - Genetics play a significant role in determining pregnancy length[1].
   - Maternal factors such as age and weight can influence gestational duration[3].
   - Early hormonal events, including implantation timing and corpus luteum rescue patterns, are predictive of pregnancy length[3].

3. Calculation methods:
   - Pregnancy is typically counted from the first day of the last menstrual period, which occurs about 2 weeks before conception[2][5].
   - This method adds approximately 2 weeks to the actual time the fetus spends developing in the uterus[5].

4. Full-term definition:
   - A pregnancy is considered full-term if birth occurs between 37 and 42 weeks after the estimated last menstrual period date[2].
   - Babies born before 37 weeks are considered premature, while those born after 42 weeks are considered post-term[2].

5. Recent trends:
   - Studies have shown that the average length of pregnancies in the United States has been decreasing over time[6][7].
   - Between 1990 and 2020, the average pregnancy length in the US declined from 39.1 weeks to 38.5 weeks[6][7].

6. International comparisons:
   - US pregnancies tend to be shorter on average compared to some European countries like England and the Netherlands[6][7].

It's important to note that while 40 weeks is often cited as the average pregnancy length, individual pregnancies can vary considerably. The actual duration can be influenced by various factors, and healthcare providers use multiple methods to estimate due dates and monitor fetal development throughout pregnancy.
