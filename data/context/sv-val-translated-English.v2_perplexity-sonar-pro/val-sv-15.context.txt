Donny Chavez is a minor character who appears in the first episode of "The Punisher" TV series. He plays a significant role in reintroducing Frank Castle's vigilante persona. Here are the key details about Donny Chavez's character and role:

1. Background: Donny Chavez is a newly hired construction worker in New York City[1][3]. He lives at 862 Linden Boulevard in Queens[5].

2. Interaction with Frank Castle: Chavez attempts to befriend Castle, who is working at the same construction site under an assumed identity[1]. Castle is initially distant, focusing on his work and keeping to himself.

3. Involvement in criminal activity: Eager to please his coworkers, Chavez agrees to help them steal money from a local gang[1]. This decision proves to be a critical mistake.

4. Consequences: During the robbery, Chavez accidentally reveals his identity to the gangsters[1]. This puts him in grave danger, as the gang now knows who he is and can potentially retaliate.

5. Rescue by Frank Castle: When Chavez's coworkers attempt to kill him at the construction site to cover their tracks, Castle intervenes[1]. He kills the coworkers and then eliminates the gangsters who were hunting Chavez[1].

6. Catalyst for Castle's return to vigilantism: This incident serves as a turning point for Frank Castle. It draws him back into the world of violence and conspiracy, reigniting his role as the Punisher[8].

7. Aftermath: After the incident, it's likely that Chavez fled Queens due to the danger posed by the Gnucci crime family, who were the targets of the botched robbery[5].

Donny Chavez's character, played by Lucca De Oliveira[2][7][9], essentially serves as a plot device to pull Frank Castle back into his role as the Punisher. His naivety and the dangerous situation he finds himself in force Castle to take action, setting the stage for the rest of the series.
