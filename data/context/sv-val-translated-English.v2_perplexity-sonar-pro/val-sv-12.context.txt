Coastal artillery, as it existed in the first half of the 20th century, is no longer actively used for defense purposes. The Coast Artillery Corps, which was responsible for operating these fixed gun emplacements, was officially abolished in 1950[1][4]. However, remnants of coastal artillery installations can still be found in various locations, often repurposed or preserved as historical sites. Here's a detailed overview of the current status of coastal artillery:

## Obsolescence and Disbandment

The Coast Artillery Corps became increasingly obsolete after World War II due to several factors:

1. Technological advancements: The development of air power and long-range missiles made fixed coastal defenses vulnerable and less effective[2].

2. Strategic shifts: The focus of military strategy moved away from static coastal defense to more mobile and flexible defense systems[2].

3. Naval supremacy: The overwhelming might of the US Navy reduced the perceived need for extensive coastal fortifications[2].

By the end of World War II, most coastal artillery installations were deactivated. In 1950, the Coast Artillery Corps was officially disbanded, marking the end of an era in U.S. military history[1][4].

## Current Status of Coastal Artillery Sites

While active coastal artillery is no longer in use, many former sites have been repurposed or preserved:

1. National and state parks: Many former coast artillery sites are now administered by national or state agencies as parks and recreation areas[1].

2. Historical preservation: Some sites have been preserved for their historical significance, offering visitors a glimpse into past military strategies and technologies.

3. Repurposed installations: Some former artillery sites have been converted for other military or civilian uses.

4. Abandoned sites: In some cases, particularly in remote areas, coastal artillery installations have been left abandoned, slowly decaying over time.

## Modern Equivalents

While traditional coastal artillery no longer exists, its function has evolved into more modern forms of coastal defense:

1. Mobile missile systems: Surface-to-ship missiles have largely replaced the role of fixed coastal guns[5].

2. Naval assets: Much of the coastal defense role has been transferred to naval forces[1].

3. Air defense systems: Anti-aircraft and missile defense systems now play a crucial role in coastal protection.

In conclusion, while the coastal artillery of the early to mid-20th century is no longer actively used, its legacy remains in the form of historical sites and more advanced, mobile defense systems. The strategic concepts behind coastal defense have evolved to meet modern military challenges, but the physical remnants of the old coastal artillery installations continue to serve as reminders of an important chapter in military history.
