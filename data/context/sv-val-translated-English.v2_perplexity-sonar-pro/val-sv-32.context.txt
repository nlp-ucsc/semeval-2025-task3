Al-Khobar has developed into a significant urban center in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province. It serves as a commercial hub for the region, with a strategic location that has contributed to its growth as a leading business and residential area[8]. The city is known for its well-planned layout, dating back to a city plan from 1942, with neatly divided residential squares intersected by roads[6][8].
