The newton (symbol: N) is the SI unit of force. It is defined as the force required to accelerate a mass of one kilogram at a rate of one meter per second squared[1][3]. 

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

1 N = 1 kg⋅m/s²

This definition is derived from Newton's second law of motion, which states that force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma)[3]. When using SI base units:

- Mass (m) is measured in kilograms (kg)
- Acceleration (a) is measured in meters per second squared (m/s²)

Therefore, the units of force (F) become kg⋅m/s², which is defined as one newton.

Some key points about the newton:

1. It is named after Sir Isaac Newton in recognition of his work on classical mechanics[1][3].

2. The newton was officially adopted as the SI unit of force in 1948 by the 9th General Conference on Weights and Measures[3].

3. One newton is approximately equal to:
   - The force of Earth's gravity on a mass of about 102 grams[1]
   - 0.224809 pound-force (lbf) in imperial units[1][3]
   - 100,000 dynes in the CGS system[3][5]

4. The newton is used in various calculations related to force, including weight (which is the force of gravity on an object's mass)[2].

5. In everyday terms, 1 N is roughly equivalent to the weight of a small apple on Earth[4].

The newton provides a standardized and precise way to measure and express force in scientific and engineering applications worldwide.
