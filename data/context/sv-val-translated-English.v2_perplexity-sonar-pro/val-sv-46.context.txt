Based on the information provided in the search results, the largest district in Nizhny Tagil appears to be Dzerzhinsky district. The city of Nizhny Tagil is divided into three city districts[1][2]:

1. Leninsky district, which encompasses the city center and Nizhnetagilsky Pond
2. Tagilstroyevsky district, described as a comparatively small section in the north part of town
3. Dzerzhinsky district, characterized as "a sizable section to the east of the city center principally consisting of apartment buildings and other residences"

Among these three districts, Dzerzhinsky is specifically described as a "sizable section," suggesting it is likely the largest of the three districts in Nizhny Tagil. However, it's important to note that the search results do not provide exact area measurements for each district, so this conclusion is based on the descriptive information available.
