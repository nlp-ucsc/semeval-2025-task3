The Red Bull Arena in Salzburg, Austria was previously known by several different names:

1. Stadion Wals-Siezenheim: This was the stadium's original name when it opened in March 2003[1][3]. It was named after its location in the municipality of Wals-Siezenheim on the outskirts of Salzburg.

2. EM-Stadion Wals-Siezenheim: The stadium was temporarily renamed to this during the UEFA Euro 2008 tournament, which was co-hosted by Austria and Switzerland[1][3].

3. Stadion Salzburg: This name is used during UEFA club football events[1].

The stadium received its current name, Red Bull Arena, in 2005 when the Red Bull company took over the football club[4]. The name change was part of a comprehensive rebranding that included the club, stadium, and all related facilities.

It's worth noting that before moving to this stadium in 2003, the club (then known as SV WÃ¼stenrot Salzburg) played at Stadion Lehen from 1971 to 2002[1].
