Lugdunum, the Roman city that later became modern-day Lyon in France, was founded in 43 BC[1][3][4][5]. The city was established by Lucius Munatius Plancus, a Roman senator and consul, under orders from the Roman Senate[1][4].

The founding of Lugdunum occurred during a tumultuous period in Roman history. It took place nine years after Julius Caesar had conquered Gaul and just one year before his assassination in Rome[3]. The city was initially created as a Roman colony, named Colonia Copia Felix Munatia, though it quickly became known as Lugdunum[1].

The foundation of Lugdunum was part of a broader Roman policy of establishing settlements in newly conquered areas. This strategy served multiple purposes:

1. Ensuring stability in recently acquired territories
2. Rewarding retired veteran soldiers with land and rights
3. Establishing Roman presence and control in strategic locations[7]

Interestingly, Lugdunum was not built on entirely new ground. Archaeological evidence suggests that the site had been occupied since the Neolithic era and had been a Gallic settlement with continuous occupation from the 4th century BC[1]. The Roman city was established on the Fourvière heights, above the Saône river, and gradually expanded to the river neighborhoods, the peninsula, and the right bank of the Saône[3].

The strategic location of Lugdunum at the confluence of the Saône and Rhône rivers contributed to its rapid growth and importance. Within a few decades of its founding, during the reign of Emperor Augustus, Lugdunum became the capital of the Roman province of Gallia Lugdunensis and a crucial administrative, commercial, and cultural center in the western part of the Roman Empire[1][3][5].
