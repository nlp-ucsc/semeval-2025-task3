The name "Galicia" has ancient origins dating back to Roman times. It derives from the Latin toponym Callaecia, later Gallaecia, which was related to the name of an ancient Celtic tribe that resided north of the Douro river[1][3][5]. This tribe was known as the Gallaeci or Callaeci in Latin, or Καλλαϊκoί (Kallaïkoí) in Greek.

The etymology of the name has been studied since the 7th century. Early attempts to explain its origin, such as that by Isidore of Seville, related the name to the Greek word γάλα (gala), meaning "milk," suggesting it referred to the fair skin of the Galicians[1]. However, modern scholars propose different theories:

1. Some relate the name to the Proto-Indo-European root *kal-n-eH2 meaning "hill," combined with a local relational suffix -aik-, thus meaning "the hill people"[1].

2. Others connect it to the Proto-Celtic *kallī- meaning "forest," suggesting it meant "the forest people"[1].

The Callaeci were the first tribe in the area to assist the Lusitanians against the invading Romans. Their name was eventually applied to the broader region and its inhabitants. The Roman general Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus, who defeated them in 137 BC, took their name as part of his title[1].

Over time, the Latin Gallaecia evolved into various forms:

- Gallicia in the early medieval period
- Galiza in the 13th century (with the emergence of the Galician language)
- Eventually settling on the current form, Galicia, which coincides with the Castilian Spanish name[1]

It's worth noting that the name Galicia is not unique to the region in Spain. There is also a historical region called Galicia in Central Europe, now divided between Poland and Ukraine. This name has a different etymology, likely derived from the Old East Slavic Галичь (Galičĭ), referring to Halych, a city in present-day Ukraine[7].

The persistence of the name Galicia through various historical periods and linguistic changes demonstrates its deep roots in the cultural and geographical identity of the region.
