Bruce Sterling's debut novel, "Involution Ocean," published in 1977, is set on a world called Nullaqua[3][5][9]. 

Nullaqua is a unique and vividly imagined planet where all the atmosphere is contained within a single, miles-deep crater[3]. The story takes place on an ocean of dust at the bottom of this enormous crater, where ships sail and hunt creatures known as dustwhales[3][5].

This world serves as a striking backdrop for Sterling's first foray into novel-length science fiction. The setting is both alien and familiar, drawing inspiration from classic literature. Specifically, "Involution Ocean" is partially a science-fictional pastiche of Herman Melville's "Moby-Dick"[3], transposing the nautical adventure to a dusty, alien environment.

The novel follows the adventures and moral education of a young man who joins the crew of a dustwhaler[5]. This premise allows Sterling to explore themes of exploration, human adaptation to extreme environments, and the pursuit of the unknown, all set against the backdrop of Nullaqua's bizarre ecology.

Sterling's creation of Nullaqua in his debut novel showcases his early talent for world-building and his ability to craft unique, thought-provoking science fiction settings. This imaginative approach to planetary environments would continue to be a hallmark of his later works in the cyberpunk and post-cyberpunk genres.
