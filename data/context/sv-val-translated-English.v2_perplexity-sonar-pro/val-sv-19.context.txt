Border Ruffians were pro-slavery activists from Missouri who crossed into Kansas Territory in the mid-1850s to influence Kansas's status as a free or slave state[1][2]. They played a significant role during the violent conflicts known as "Bleeding Kansas," which occurred between 1854 and 1859[2][5].

These pro-slavery activists engaged in various activities to sway Kansas towards becoming a slave state:

1. Electoral fraud: In November 1854, thousands of armed Border Ruffians poured into Kansas Territory and manipulated the election for a nonvoting delegate to Congress, favoring the pro-slavery Democratic candidate[2].

2. Intimidation and violence: Border Ruffians used threats, assaults, and even murders to intimidate anti-slavery settlers[2]. One notable incident was the "Sack of Lawrence" in May 1856, where they set fire to buildings and destroyed an abolitionist newspaper's printing press[5].

3. Illegal voting: During territorial elections, Border Ruffians exploited loopholes in residency requirements to cast illegal ballots and stuff ballot boxes with fictitious votes[5].

The actions of Border Ruffians contributed to the breakdown of compromise between the North and South, escalating tensions over the slavery issue[1]. Their activities were part of a larger struggle that included:

- Pro-slavery factions creating a territorial government in Lecompton, which implemented harsh laws against anti-slavery activities[6].
- Anti-slavery settlers forming a rival territorial government in Topeka[6].
- Violent clashes between pro-slavery and anti-slavery groups, including incidents like John Brown's Pottawatomie Massacre[5][7].

The term "Border Ruffian" was initially used as an insult by Northern abolitionists but was later embraced by some Missourians as a badge of honor[9]. The conflict in Kansas served as a prelude to the American Civil War, with the violence and political turmoil foreshadowing the larger national conflict to come[2][7].
