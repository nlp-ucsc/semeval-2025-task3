Cerebral palsy typically occurs before or around birth, but it can develop in early childhood as well. Specifically:

Cerebral palsy most commonly develops due to brain damage that occurs:

1. Before birth (during pregnancy)[5][9]
2. During birth or delivery[5][9]
3. Shortly after birth[5][9]
4. In early childhood, typically within the first 2-3 years of life[4][5]

The majority of cerebral palsy cases are congenital, meaning the brain damage occurs before or during birth[4]. However, a small percentage of cases are acquired after birth, usually due to brain infections, head injuries, or other factors affecting brain development in early childhood[4].

While the brain damage that causes cerebral palsy occurs early in life, diagnosis often doesn't happen immediately. Most children with cerebral palsy are diagnosed:

- Between 1 and 2 years of age for more severe cases[1][4]
- By age 2 or 3 for many cases[6][8]
- Sometimes not until age 4 or 5 for milder cases[4][9]

Early signs may be noticeable in the first few months of life, but a definitive diagnosis can take time as doctors monitor the child's development[3]. Some key timeframes for identifying potential cerebral palsy include:

- 6-9 months: When developmental delays or abnormal muscle tone may become apparent[5]
- 9, 18, and 24 months: Recommended screening ages for developmental delays[9]
- Before age 3: When most children with cerebral palsy are diagnosed[7]

It's important to note that while the underlying brain damage doesn't worsen over time, symptoms may change as a child grows and develops[4][5]. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for managing symptoms and improving outcomes for children with cerebral palsy.
