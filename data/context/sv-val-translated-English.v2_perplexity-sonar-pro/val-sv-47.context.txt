Toruń was admitted into the Hanseatic League approximately 47 years after its founding.

The city of Toruń was founded in 1233 when the Teutonic Knights Hermann von Salza and Hermann Balk signed the foundation charters for Toruń (Thorn) and Chełmno on December 28, 1233[1]. In 1236, due to frequent flooding, the city was relocated to its present site[1].

Toruń became a member of the Hanseatic League in 1280[1][2]. This means that approximately 47 years passed between the city's founding in 1233 and its admission to the Hanseatic League in 1280.

The rapid admission of Toruń into the Hanseatic League demonstrates the city's quick rise to prominence as a trading center. Within less than five decades of its establishment, Toruń had become an important enough commercial hub to join this influential merchant association[2]. This swift development highlights Toruń's strategic location on the Vistula River and its growing economic significance in the region during the 13th century.
