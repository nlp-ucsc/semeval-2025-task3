I apologize, but I don't have enough information from the given search results to determine when Hamilton Academical FC played their first match or what the result was. The search results don't provide historical information about the club's very first match.

What we do know from the search results is that Hamilton Academical FC was formed in late 1874 by the rector and pupils of Hamilton Academy[1][6]. They joined the Scottish Football League in November 1897[1][6]. However, the specific details about their first-ever match are not provided in the given information.

If you're interested in the club's early history, I can share some other relevant facts:

1. Hamilton Academical is the only professional club in British football to have originated from a school team[1][6].

2. The club initially competed in the Scottish Cup and Qualifying Cup before joining the Scottish Football League[1][6].

3. In the 1905-06 season, they were promoted to the First Division, despite finishing in 4th place[3].

4. The club reached the Scottish Cup Final twice, in 1911 and 1935, losing to Celtic and Rangers respectively[1][6].

To get information about Hamilton Academical's first match, we would need to consult more detailed historical records or archives specific to the club's early years, which are not provided in the current search results.
