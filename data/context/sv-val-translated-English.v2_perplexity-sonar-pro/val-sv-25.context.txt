Gregory III Laham was elected as the Patriarch of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church on November 29, 2000[1]. He succeeded Patriarch Maximos V Hakim in this role as the spiritual leader of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church[1]. 

After his election by the episcopal synod of the Melkite Church, which met at the patriarchal residence in Raboueh, Gregory III Laham chose the name Gregory in honor of Patriarch Gregory II Youssef, who was the last member of his religious order (the Basilian Salvatorian Order) to be elected Patriarch[1]. On December 5, 2000, Pope John Paul II accepted Patriarch Laham's request for ecclesiastical communion, formally recognizing him as the head of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church[1].

Gregory III Laham served as the Patriarch for nearly 17 years before retiring on May 6, 2017, at the age of 83[3][9]. During his tenure, he was an advocate for Christian communities in the Near and Middle East and worked on various social and religious projects[1][3].
