The Portuguese republican revolts primarily broke out in Lisbon, the capital city of Portugal. However, Porto (also known as Oporto), the country's second-largest city, also played a significant role in some of the revolutionary attempts. Here are the key details:

1. Lisbon:
Lisbon was the main center of republican activity and the site of several major revolts:

- The 5 October 1910 revolution, which successfully overthrew the monarchy and established the First Portuguese Republic, took place primarily in Lisbon[9]. The republic was proclaimed from the balcony of Lisbon's City Hall on October 5, 1910.

- Lisbon was crucial to the republican cause. As one source states, "Lisbon is republican. Without it there would have been no republic and without it the republic would disappear like morning mist"[5].

- The assassination of King Carlos I, which was a pivotal event leading to the eventual fall of the monarchy, occurred in Lisbon on February 1, 1908[9].

- In January 1919, there was a monarchist insurrection in Lisbon, which was part of the ongoing political instability following the establishment of the republic[2].

2. Porto:
While Lisbon was the primary focus, Porto also saw significant revolutionary activity:

- The 31 January 1891 revolt, which was the first major attempt by republicans to overthrow the monarchy, took place in Porto[1]. This revolt, although unsuccessful, is considered a precursor to the eventual establishment of the republic.

- In January 1919, there was also an attempt to restore the monarchy in northern Portugal, which likely involved activity in Porto[2].

The importance of these two cities in the republican movement can be attributed to their size, political significance, and concentration of republican sympathizers. Lisbon, as the capital and largest city, was particularly crucial. As one source notes, "Lisbon plays a role in this revolution similar to that of London in the Puritan revolution and Paris in the French revolutions"[5].

It's worth noting that while these two cities were the main centers of revolutionary activity, the republican movement and its effects were felt throughout Portugal, leading to significant changes in the country's political landscape in the early 20th century.
