The oldest kremlin in Russia is the Novgorod Kremlin, also known as Novgorod Detinets, located in Veliky Novgorod. Recent archaeological evidence suggests that it is even older than previously thought.

Traditionally, historical records indicated that the Novgorod Kremlin was founded in 1044 by Prince Vladimir Yaroslavovich[5]. However, recent radiocarbon dating of wooden fortification fragments found under one of the former towers has revealed that the fortress likely existed much earlier[6]. The dating results suggest that the Novgorod Kremlin could have been established as early as the middle of the 10th century, potentially predating even the Christianization of Kievan Rus' in 988.

Specifically, the radiocarbon dating of two wooden fragments yielded the following results:
1. One fragment was dated to be around 951 years old (with a margin of error of 27 years)
2. Another fragment was dated to be about 918 years old (with a margin of error of 41 years)

These findings push back the estimated age of the Novgorod Kremlin by nearly a century from its previously assumed founding date. This makes the Novgorod Kremlin not only the oldest kremlin in Russia but also one of the oldest fortifications in the country.

The Novgorod Kremlin has played a significant role in Russian history, serving as a center of political and religious life during the era of the Novgorod Republic (12th-15th centuries)[5]. Today, it stands as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, showcasing remarkable examples of medieval Russian architecture and containing important historical structures such as the St. Sofia Cathedral, which dates back to 1052[5].
