The spiritual leader of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism holds the title of "Sakya Trizin"[1][4][5]. Some key points about this title and role:

1. "Sakya Trizin" translates to "the holder of the Sakya throne"[5][8].

2. This position is always held by a male member of the Khön family, which founded the Sakya order in the 11th-12th centuries[4][5].

3. Historically, the Sakya Trizin was a lifetime position that rotated between two branches of the Khön lineage - the Phuntsok Potrang and the Dolma Potrang[8].

4. In 2017, a significant change occurred in the Sakya leadership structure:

   - His Holiness Kyabgon Gongma Trichen Rinpoche (also known as Ngawang Kunga) served as the 41st Sakya Trizin from 1959 to 2017[3][4][7].
   
   - On March 9, 2017, he passed the throne holder duties to his elder son, His Holiness Ratna Vajra Rinpoche, who became the 42nd Sakya Trizin[3][4].

5. After this transition, the role of Sakya Trizin changed from a lifetime position to a three-year term that rotates between qualified male descendants of the two Khön family branches[8].

6. The former 41st Sakya Trizin is now known as Kyabgon Gongma Trichen Rinpoche and is still regarded as the supreme head of the Sakya Order[3][7].

This change in leadership structure represents a significant evolution in the governance of the Sakya school, aiming to provide opportunities for different qualified members of the Khön lineage to lead the tradition.
