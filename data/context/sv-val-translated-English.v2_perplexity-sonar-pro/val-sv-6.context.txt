I apologize, but I don't have any specific information about a "jungle oriole" or its beak color in the provided search results. The search results mainly contain information about other oriole species like the Baltimore oriole, orange oriole, and golden oriole, but do not mention a "jungle oriole."

To provide a more helpful response:

1. There may be some confusion with the name "jungle oriole." This specific term doesn't appear to be a commonly recognized species name.

2. If you're referring to a different oriole species that lives in jungle habitats, it would be helpful to clarify which specific species you're interested in.

3. For reference, here's some information about beak colors of other oriole species mentioned in the search results:

   - The Baltimore oriole has a "conical and pointy bluish-dusky" bill with a paler mandible[1].
   - The orange oriole has a "pointed beak"[3], but the specific color isn't mentioned.
   - The golden oriole found in Bengaluru has a "broad pink beak"[4].

If you could provide more details about the specific oriole species you're inquiring about, or if you meant to ask about a different bird, I'd be happy to help further or research additional information for you.
