Erysiphaceae belongs to the order Erysiphales[1][4]. The Erysiphaceae is the only family within the order Erysiphales[1]. 

Some key points about the classification of Erysiphaceae:

1. Kingdom: Fungi
2. Phylum: Ascomycota 
3. Class: Leotiomycetes
4. Order: Erysiphales
5. Family: Erysiphaceae

The Erysiphaceae family contains around 28 genera and approximately 1000 species of fungi[1]. These fungi are commonly known as powdery mildews, as many of them cause plant diseases characterized by a powdery mildew appearance on infected plants[1][10].

Some notable characteristics of the Erysiphaceae family include:

- They are obligate biotrophic fungi, meaning they require living plant tissue to survive and reproduce[6].
- They have a superficial mycelium that extracts nutrients from host plants using specialized structures called haustoria[1].
- Their asexual spores (conidia) are typically produced singly on conidiophores[4].
- The sexual fruiting bodies (chasmothecia) often have distinctive appendages that can be used for taxonomic identification[1][3].

The Erysiphaceae family is of significant economic and ecological importance due to the plant diseases caused by many of its members, affecting crops, ornamental plants, and wild plant species worldwide[10].
