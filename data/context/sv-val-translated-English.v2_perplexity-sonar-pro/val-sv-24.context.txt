To determine the population density of General Pinedo, we need to find its population and area, then divide the population by the area.

According to the search results, General Pinedo is located in the Doce de Octubre Department of Chaco Province, Argentina. The most recent population figure provided for General Pinedo is 15,741 inhabitants[3][10].

However, the search results do not provide a specific area for General Pinedo itself. Instead, we have information about the Doce de Octubre Department, which includes General Pinedo:

Area of Doce de Octubre Department: 2,576 km²[2][4]

Since we don't have the exact area of General Pinedo, we cannot calculate its precise population density. However, we can calculate the population density of the entire Doce de Octubre Department as an approximation:

Population of Doce de Octubre Department (2010 census): 22,281[4]
Area: 2,576 km²

Population density = 22,281 / 2,576 ≈ 8.65 inhabitants per km²

This aligns with the density figure provided in the search results for the Doce de Octubre Department[4].

It's important to note that this figure represents the average density for the entire department, not specifically for General Pinedo. The town itself likely has a higher population density, as urban areas tend to be more densely populated than rural areas within the same department.

For a more accurate figure specific to General Pinedo, we would need data on the town's exact area, which is not provided in the search results.
