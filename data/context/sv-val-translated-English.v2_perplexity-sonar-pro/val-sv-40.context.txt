The Emirate of Córdoba existed from 756 to 929 CE[2][4]. It was established as an independent Muslim state in al-Andalus (present-day Spain and Portugal) by Abd al-Rahman I, a surviving prince of the Umayyad dynasty[2].

Key events and details about the Emirate of Córdoba:

1. Foundation: The emirate was founded on May 15, 756 CE, when Abd al-Rahman I proclaimed himself emir of Córdoba[4]. This came after he fled from Damascus following the Abbasid overthrow of the Umayyad Caliphate in 750 CE[1][2].

2. Capital: Córdoba served as the capital of the emirate[2][4]. Under Umayyad rule, it grew to become one of the largest and most cultured cities in Europe[3].

3. Territory: The emirate's territory included much of the Iberian Peninsula, though its exact borders fluctuated over time[1][2].

4. Governance: The state was ruled by a series of emirs from the Umayyad dynasty[4]. There were eight emirs who ruled between 756 and 929 CE[6].

5. Culture and achievements: The emirate period saw significant cultural and intellectual development. Córdoba became a center of learning, with celebrated libraries and schools[5].

6. End of the emirate: The Emirate of Córdoba came to an end on January 16, 929 CE, when Abd al-Rahman III proclaimed himself caliph[4][9]. This marked the transition from the Emirate to the Caliphate of Córdoba, which lasted until 1031 CE[9].

The Emirate of Córdoba played a crucial role in the history of Islamic Spain, laying the foundation for the subsequent Caliphate period and contributing significantly to the cultural and intellectual landscape of medieval Europe.
