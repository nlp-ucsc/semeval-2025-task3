Dave Franco has two older brothers:

1. James Franco, born in 1978, is the eldest of the Franco brothers[1][5]. He is a well-known actor, director, and writer who gained fame for his roles in films like "Spider-Man," "127 Hours," and "The Disaster Artist"[1][5].

2. Tom Franco, born in 1980, is the middle brother[1][3]. While not as famous as James and Dave in the acting world, Tom is an accomplished artist and entrepreneur. He is the founder and co-director of Berkeley's Firehouse Art Collective[3][4].

Dave Franco, born in 1985, is the youngest of the three Franco brothers[1][2]. All three brothers were raised in Palo Alto, California, in what Dave described as a "weird and artsy" household[1]. Their parents encouraged their artistic pursuits, with their mother, Betsy Franco, being a writer and their father having studied painting[1][5].

The Franco brothers have occasionally collaborated professionally. For example, James and Dave starred together in "The Disaster Artist" (2017), which James also directed[1]. Tom had a small role in this film as well[1][3]. Despite their family connections, Dave initially sought to distance himself from James in his professional work to establish his own identity in the entertainment industry[5].
