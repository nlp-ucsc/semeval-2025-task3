There are typically three main classes of diplomatic missions within the foreign service:

1. Embassies: These are the primary diplomatic missions located in the capital cities of host countries. Embassies are headed by ambassadors and offer a full range of diplomatic and consular services[1][4]. In Commonwealth countries, the equivalent of an embassy is called a high commission[1].

2. Consulates: These are smaller diplomatic missions usually located in major cities outside the capital. There are three subtypes of consulates[4]:

   - Consulates-general: Located in major cities, providing a full range of consular services[1].
   - Regular consulates: Similar to consulates-general but may offer a more limited range of services[1][4].
   - Honorary consulates: Headed by honorary consuls who are often citizens of the host country, providing limited services[4].

3. Permanent missions: These are diplomatic missions to major international organizations, such as the United Nations, rather than to specific countries[1][4].

Additionally, there are some other types of diplomatic representation that are less common or no longer in use:

- Legations: These were lower-ranking diplomatic missions headed by ministers rather than ambassadors. However, legations have fallen out of favor since World War II and are no longer used[1].

- Interest sections: These operate under the protection of a third country when two nations do not have formal diplomatic relations. They function similarly to embassies but under the formal auspices of another country's embassy[10].

It's worth noting that the specific terminology and structure can vary somewhat between countries, but these are the main classes of diplomatic missions recognized in international diplomacy.
