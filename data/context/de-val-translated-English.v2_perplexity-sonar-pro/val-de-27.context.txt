The national anthem of Portugal, titled "A Portuguesa" (meaning "The Portuguese"), was composed by Alfredo Keil with lyrics written by Henrique Lopes de Mendonça in 1890[1][2]. 

Alfredo Cristiano Keil (1850-1907) was a Portuguese composer, painter, poet, archaeologist, and art collector[2]. He composed the music for "A Portuguesa" in response to the 1890 British Ultimatum to Portugal regarding its African colonies[1]. This ultimatum demanded that Portugal refrain from colonizing land between its colonies of Angola and Mozambique, which sparked a resurgent nationalist movement in Portugal[1].

Henrique Lopes de Mendonça, a poet and playwright, wrote the lyrics to accompany Keil's melody[1]. Together, they created "A Portuguesa" as a patriotic protest march, expressing the outrage felt by the Portuguese people at the time[1].

The song quickly gained popularity and was disseminated widely, with thousands of copies of the sheet music being freely distributed along with fliers and posters[1]. It was used as the marching song during the failed republican revolt of January 31, 1891, in Porto[1].

"A Portuguesa" was officially adopted as the national anthem of Portugal on October 5, 1910, following the establishment of the Portuguese Republic[1]. It replaced the previous anthem "Hino da Carta," which had been associated with the deposed constitutional monarchy[1].
