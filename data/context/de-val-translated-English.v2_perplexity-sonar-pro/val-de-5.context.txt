FC Astana-1964 (formerly known as Zhenis Astana) defeated Irtysh Pavlodar to win their second Kazakhstan Cup in 2002[3]. The final score was 1-0, with the match taking place at the Central Stadium in Almaty[3].

This victory came after their first cup win in the 2000-01 season, where they (then known as Astana-64) also defeated Irtysh Pavlodar in the final, winning on penalties after a 1-1 draw in extra time[3].

It's worth noting that FC Astana-1964 is a different club from the current FC Astana. FC Astana-1964 was founded in 1964 as Dinamo Tselinograd and went through several name changes before folding in 2014[7][8]. The current FC Astana was founded in 2009 as Lokomotiv Astana and is a separate entity[5][8].
