Based on the available search results, I don't have specific information about Eduardo Ant√¥nio dos Santos' (commonly known as Edu Manga) goal tally for his first season at Real Valladolid. The search results provide limited details about his time at Real Valladolid, only mentioning that he played for the club during the 1996-1997 season[1].

However, I can provide some related information:

1. Edu Manga played for Real Valladolid during the 1996-1997 season[1].

2. In the 1997-1998 season, which appears to be his second season with the club, Real Valladolid finished 11th in LaLiga[3].

3. There is a record of Edu Manga scoring one goal for Real Valladolid in a UEFA Cup match against Skonto FC, but this was during the 1997-1998 season[10].

Unfortunately, the search results do not provide specific goal statistics for Edu Manga's first season at Real Valladolid. To get accurate information about his goal tally for that particular season, we would need to consult more detailed club records or season statistics that are not available in the given search results.
