Chance the Rapper's album "Coloring Book" won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 2017 Grammy Awards[1][2]. This was a significant achievement for several reasons:

1. It was the first streaming-only album to win a Grammy Award[2][5]. "Coloring Book" was released exclusively on Apple Music before being made available on other streaming platforms, and it never had a physical release or digital download option.

2. The win marked a historic moment in Grammy history, as it prompted the Grammy Awards to change their rules to allow streaming-only titles to be eligible for nomination[2].

3. "Coloring Book" debuted at number eight on the US Billboard 200 chart based solely on streaming numbers, becoming the first release to chart on the Billboard 200 exclusively through streams[5].

4. The album received widespread critical acclaim for its fusion of hip hop and gospel sounds[5].

5. In addition to Best Rap Album, Chance the Rapper also won the Grammy for Best New Artist and Best Rap Performance for his song "No Problem" featuring Lil Wayne and 2 Chainz[2][4].

This Grammy win was part of a successful awards season for "Coloring Book," which also included:

- Winning Best Mixtape at the BET Hip Hop Awards[3]
- Nominations for Outstanding Album and Outstanding Male Artist at the NAACP Image Awards[4]

The success of "Coloring Book" and its Grammy win represented a significant shift in the music industry, acknowledging the growing importance of streaming platforms and validating alternative distribution methods for artists.
