Bischofsheim was a district of Mainz from 1930 to 1945, a period of 15 years[2][4].

In 1930, Bischofsheim was incorporated into the city of Mainz[4]. This incorporation was likely due to financial difficulties faced by Bischofsheim in the late 1920s, as mentioned in source [1], which states that "An international trade crisis, years of inflation, a high rate of unemployment, as well as the necessity for the laying of water and gas pipes at the end of the 1920s exceeded the financial capabilities of the community and resulted in Bischofsheim being incorporated as a part of the city of Mainz on January 1, 1930."

This arrangement lasted until the end of World War II in 1945. At that time, the American and French occupying authorities separated Bischofsheim from Mainz[2][4]. This separation occurred because the Rhine River became the boundary between the American and French occupation zones after the war. As a result, Bischofsheim, which is located on the right bank of the Rhine, was placed under American administration and subsequently became part of the newly formed state of Hesse[2][4].

It's worth noting that although Bischofsheim regained its status as an independent municipality after 1945, some remnants of its connection to Mainz remain. For example, the local train station is still called "Mainz-Bischofsheim" despite the administrative separation[2].
