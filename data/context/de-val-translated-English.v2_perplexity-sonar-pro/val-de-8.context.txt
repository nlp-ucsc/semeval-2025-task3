Hüffelsheim is a very old settlement with a long history dating back over 1,200 years. The village had its first documentary mention around 766 AD[1]. However, its origins likely go back even further, as it is believed to have grown out of a Roman country estate that existed prior to the Frankish conquest under King Clovis around 500 AD[1].

Some key points about Hüffelsheim's age and early history:

- It likely originated as a Roman estate before 500 AD[1]
- After the Frankish conquest around 500 AD, it came under Frankish ownership[1]
- The first written record of the village dates to approximately 766 AD[1]
- By 800 AD, the first Christian church was built in the village[1]

So while the exact founding date is unknown, Hüffelsheim has existed as a settlement for well over 1,200 years, with roots potentially going back around 1,500 years or more to the Roman era. The village has a rich history spanning the Roman period, Frankish rule, the Middle Ages, and into the modern era.
