Posey County, Indiana was formed in November 1814 from parts of Gibson and Warrick counties[1][3][4][5]. Specifically:

1. The county was officially established on November 11, 1814[3][5].

2. It was created from portions of Gibson County and Warrick County[1][3][4][5].

3. Prior to this, the area that became Posey County was part of Knox County, which was one of the original counties in the Indiana Territory[10].

4. The county was named after Revolutionary War General Thomas Posey, who was serving as the Governor of the Indiana Territory at the time[1][3].

5. Initially, Posey County had slightly different boundaries than it does today. In December 1818, Vanderburgh County was formed from parts of Gibson, Warrick, and Posey counties, which reduced Posey County to its present boundaries[5].

6. After this adjustment, Posey County reached its current area of approximately 409.57 square miles[3].

It's worth noting that the formation of Posey County occurred while Indiana was still a territory. Indiana would not become a state until December 11, 1816, about two years after Posey County was established[1].
