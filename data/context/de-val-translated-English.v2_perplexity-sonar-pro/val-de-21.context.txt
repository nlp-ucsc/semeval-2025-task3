The Red Bull Arena in Wals-Siezenheim underwent significant remodeling and expansion for the UEFA Euro 2008 football championship. Here are the key changes made to the stadium:

1. Increased capacity: The stadium's original capacity of 18,250 was expanded to over 30,000 to accommodate more spectators for the Euro 2008 matches[1][5]. The current seating capacity is 30,188[1].

2. Addition of an upper tier: A second balcony or upper tier was constructed to increase the seating capacity. This involved adding 13,500 new seats[9].

3. Structural changes: The existing stadium roof was raised by 10.5 meters to allow for the installation of the new upper tier. This was done by hydraulically lifting the entire stadium roof in one piece[9].

4. New steel construction: The new upper tier was executed as a steel construction, featuring V-pillars and truss beams as the supporting structure for light aluminum stands[9].

5. Additional facilities: A new upper distribution tier was added to house infrastructure such as kiosks, sanitary facilities, and steward rooms[9].

6. Improved access: Exterior stair towers and access bridges were built to lead to the new circumferential distributor area[9].

7. Media accommodations: 900 additional media seats were installed to cater to the increased press coverage during the tournament[9].

8. Playing surface: While the stadium initially had artificial turf, it was converted to natural grass for the Euro 2008. However, after the tournament, it reverted to artificial turf before switching back to natural grass in 2010[1][5].

9. Modernization: All areas of the stadium were adapted and brought up to international standards[7].

10. Renaming: For the duration of the Euro 2008, the stadium was officially known as the "EM Stadion Wals-Siezenheim"[1][5].

These extensive renovations, which began in 2006 and were completed by 2007, transformed the Red Bull Arena into a modern, high-capacity venue capable of hosting major international football events[3][7]. The total cost of these renovations was reported to be around 25 million euros[2].
