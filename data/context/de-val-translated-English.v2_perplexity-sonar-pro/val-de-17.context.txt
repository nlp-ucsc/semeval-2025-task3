The coast of Galicia is approximately 1,500 to 1,660 kilometers (930 to 1,030 miles) long, making it one of the longest coastlines in Spain[2][4][6]. This extensive coastline accounts for almost 20% of Spain's total coastline[6].

Galicia's coast is characterized by its diverse and dramatic landscapes, including:

1. Rugged cliffs and steep rock formations
2. Long sandy beaches
3. Hidden coves and inlets
4. Numerous islands and islets

A unique feature of the Galician coast is the presence of rias, which are long, fjord-like inlets created by drowned river valleys[2][4]. These rias are divided into two main groups:

1. Rías Altas (Upper Rias): Located in the northern part of Galicia
2. Rías Baixas (Lower Rias): Found in the southern part of the region

The coastline is home to several notable geographical features:

- Cape Finisterre (Fisterra): Once considered the westernmost point of Europe
- Estaca de Bares: The northernmost point of Spain
- Atlantic Islands of Galicia National Park: Including the Cíes Islands, Ons, Sálvora, and Cortegada Island[4]

This extensive and varied coastline contributes significantly to Galicia's appeal as a tourist destination, offering visitors:

- Beautiful beaches for relaxation and water activities
- Excellent conditions for surfing and other water sports
- Picturesque fishing villages to explore
- Rich marine ecosystems supporting a thriving seafood industry

The length and diversity of Galicia's coast make it a unique and important feature of the region, playing a crucial role in its culture, economy, and natural beauty.
