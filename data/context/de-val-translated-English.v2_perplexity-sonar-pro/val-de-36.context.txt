A typical human pregnancy lasts approximately 40 weeks or 280 days from the first day of the last menstrual period to the birth of the baby[1][2][3]. However, it's important to understand that this duration can vary, and not all pregnancies follow this exact timeline.

Here are some key points about pregnancy duration:

1. Full-term pregnancy: A full-term pregnancy is defined as lasting between 39 weeks, 0 days and 40 weeks, 6 days[1]. Babies born during this period have the best chance of being healthy.

2. Calculation method: Pregnancy is typically calculated from the first day of the last menstrual period, which means it includes about two weeks before actual conception occurs[3][4]. This is why pregnancy is often referred to as lasting 40 weeks, even though the fetus only develops for about 38 weeks.

3. Trimesters: Pregnancy is divided into three trimesters, each lasting approximately 13 weeks[4].

4. Variation in delivery timing: Only about 4% of women give birth on their exact due date[2]. It's common for babies to be born within a week before or after the estimated due date.

5. Preterm and post-term pregnancies: 
   - Preterm babies are those born before 37 weeks of pregnancy[5].
   - Post-term pregnancies are those that last beyond 42 weeks[7].

6. Medical perspective: Healthcare providers typically measure pregnancy in weeks and days, rather than months[3]. This allows for more precise tracking of fetal development and maternal health.

7. Induction considerations: If a pregnancy extends beyond 41-42 weeks, healthcare providers may recommend inducing labor due to increased risks associated with post-term pregnancies[8][9].

It's crucial to remember that while 40 weeks is considered the average length of pregnancy, every pregnancy is unique. Regular prenatal care and communication with healthcare providers are essential for monitoring the health of both the mother and the developing baby throughout the pregnancy journey.
