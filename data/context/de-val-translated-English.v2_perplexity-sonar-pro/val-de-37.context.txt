In 1975, Jef Raskin founded a company called Bannister & Crun[9]. This company focused on writing software and manuals for the emerging microcomputer industry. Raskin started Bannister & Crun as the personal computer industry was just beginning to take shape in the mid-1970s.

Some key points about Bannister & Crun:

1. It was founded in 1975, predating Raskin's involvement with Apple Computer.

2. The company's primary activities were developing software and creating documentation for early microcomputers.

3. This venture reflected Raskin's early involvement in the nascent personal computing field, combining his technical knowledge with his skills in writing and documentation.

4. The company's work in 1975-1976 coincided with the very early days of the microcomputer industry, positioning Raskin at the forefront of this technological revolution.

5. Raskin's experience with Bannister & Crun likely contributed to his later roles at Apple, where he initially joined as Manager of Publications in 1978[1].

This early entrepreneurial effort by Raskin demonstrates his longstanding interest in making computers more accessible through better software and documentation, a philosophy that would later influence his work on the Macintosh project at Apple.
