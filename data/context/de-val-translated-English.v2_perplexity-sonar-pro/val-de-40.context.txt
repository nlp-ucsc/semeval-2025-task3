Haustoria are specialized structures formed by powdery mildew fungi that play a crucial role in their parasitic relationship with host plants. Here are the key features and functions of haustoria in powdery mildew fungi:

## Structure and Formation

Haustoria are unicellular structures that develop inside the epidermal cells of the host plant[1]. They typically consist of a globular central body with projecting filamentous lobes[1]. The formation of haustoria occurs after the fungus penetrates the plant cell wall, but they remain separated from the host cell cytoplasm by a specialized membrane called the extrahaustorial membrane (EHM)[1][3].

## Function

1. Nutrient Acquisition: Haustoria are primarily responsible for absorbing nutrients from the host plant cells[1][2].

2. Effector Delivery: They serve as a conduit for delivering effector proteins into host cells, which help manipulate host defense responses and other cellular functions[1].

3. Pathogen-Host Interaction: Haustoria are the primary interface for molecular communication between the fungus and the host plant[3].

## Unique Characteristics

- Surface Growth: Unlike many other fungal pathogens, most of the powdery mildew fungus remains on the outside of the plant surface, with only the haustoria penetrating the plant cells[2][4].

- No Free Water Requirement: Powdery mildew conidia (spores) can germinate and form haustoria without the need for free water on the plant surface, which is unusual among fungal pathogens[4][6].

- Host Specificity: The structure and function of haustoria can vary depending on the specific powdery mildew species and its host plant[3][8].

## Microscopic Features

- Extrahaustorial Membrane: The haustorium is surrounded by the plant-derived EHM, which has a highly irregular outline as seen under transmission electron microscopy[3].

- Vesicles and Plaques: Electron-dense plaques and vesicles are often observed surrounding the haustoria, indicating active cellular processes[3].

- Callose Deposition: As haustoria develop, there is often an associated deposition of callose (a plant polysaccharide) around the haustorial complex[3].

Understanding the structure and function of haustoria is crucial for developing strategies to control powdery mildew diseases, as these structures are essential for the pathogen's survival and virulence.
