I apologize, but I don't have specific information about a "jungle oriole" in the provided search results or in my existing knowledge. However, I can provide some general information about oriole diets based on the search results for other oriole species:

Orioles generally have a diverse diet that includes:

1. Insects: Orioles feed heavily on insects, especially during the breeding season[1][5]. They particularly enjoy:
   - Caterpillars (including hairy types that other birds avoid)
   - Beetles
   - Grasshoppers
   - Wasps
   - Spiders

2. Fruits: Orioles are known for their love of fruits[1][2][4]. Some favorites include:
   - Oranges (especially orange halves)
   - Berries (raspberries, elderberries, mulberries)
   - Grapes
   - Cherries
   - Peaches
   - Apples
   - Bananas

3. Nectar: Orioles are attracted to sweet liquids[1][2][5]. They consume:
   - Natural flower nectar (e.g., from trumpet vines)
   - Sugar water solutions (similar to what's offered to hummingbirds)

4. Jelly: Many oriole enthusiasts offer grape jelly as a treat for these birds[3][4].

5. Mealworms: These are particularly important during nesting season for added protein[4].

While I don't have specific information about jungle orioles, it's likely that their diet would be similar to other oriole species, with potential variations based on the available food sources in their specific habitat. They would likely consume a mix of insects, fruits, and nectar found in their jungle environment.

If you're trying to attract orioles or provide food for them, offering a variety of these food types would be most effective[2][4]. Remember to place feeders about seven feet off the ground and start offering food early in the season to establish your yard as a reliable food source[4].
