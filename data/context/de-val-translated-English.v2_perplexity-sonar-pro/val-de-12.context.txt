The three novels in the Shadow Trilogy by Chris Claremont are:

1. Shadow Moon (1995)
2. Shadow Dawn (1996)
3. Shadow Star (1999)

These novels were co-written by Chris Claremont and George Lucas, continuing the story from the 1988 film Willow. The trilogy is also known as the Chronicles of the Shadow War[1][2][5].

Shadow Moon is the first book, introducing the story 13 years after the events of the Willow film. It follows Willow Ufgood, now known as Thorn Drumheller, as he investigates a cataclysmic event and protects a teenage Elora Danan[5].

Shadow Dawn is the second book, continuing the adventure as Elora Danan and Thorn Drumheller face new challenges and confront the evil force known as the Deceiver[2].

Shadow Star concludes the trilogy, bringing the epic tale to its climax as Elora and her companions struggle against powerful enemies and confront the darkness within[4].

These fantasy novels expand the world of Willow, introducing new characters and delving deeper into the realms of magic and adventure established in the original film[1][2][5].
