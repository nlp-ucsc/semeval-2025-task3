In 1951, Sir Richard Doll and his colleague Sir Austin Bradford Hill conducted a groundbreaking case-control study that demonstrated a strong link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer[1][5]. 

Specifically, the study showed:

1. There was a clear association between smoking and increased risk of lung cancer[1][5].

2. The risk of developing lung cancer was significantly higher in smokers compared to non-smokers[1].

3. There was a dose-response relationship - the more cigarettes smoked daily, the higher the risk of lung cancer[2].

4. The study provided some of the first convincing statistical evidence that tobacco smoking increases the risk of lung cancer[5].

This case-control study was pivotal in establishing the causal relationship between smoking and lung cancer. It compared the smoking habits of lung cancer patients (cases) with those of control subjects without lung cancer[1]. The results were so striking that Doll himself, who had been a smoker for 19 years, quit smoking in 1949 as he began to realize the harmful effects[8].

The findings from this initial case-control study were considered so important that Doll and Hill were advised to confirm the results in other parts of the country beyond London[4]. This led them to initiate the larger prospective cohort study known as the British Doctors' Study in October 1951, which would go on to provide even more conclusive evidence over the following decades[3][5].
