Jackdaws typically weigh between 220-240 grams (7.8-8.5 ounces), though there is some variation in weight across different sources and populations[1][2][3][5].

More specifically:

- The average weight of adult jackdaws is reported as 232 grams, with a range of 196-265 grams based on a sample of 764 birds[5].
- Male jackdaws tend to be slightly heavier, averaging 242 grams (range 210-270 grams)[5].
- Females average 226 grams (range 198-251 grams)[5].
- Juveniles are typically lighter, with an average weight of 210 grams (range 151-259 grams)[5].

Some sources provide slightly different figures:

- The RSPB lists the typical weight as 220 grams[6].
- Another source mentions a wider range of 136-265 grams (4.8-9.3 oz)[7].

It's worth noting that weights can vary based on factors such as season, food availability, and geographic location. The jackdaw is considered the smallest member of the crow family in the UK, which is reflected in its relatively light weight compared to other corvids[3][4].
