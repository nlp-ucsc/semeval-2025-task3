Petra van Staveren of the Netherlands won the gold medal in the women's 100m breaststroke at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles[1][3][6]. She set a new Olympic record with a time of 1:09.88[1][3].

The medal results for this event were:

1. Gold: Petra van Staveren (Netherlands) - 1:09.88 (Olympic Record)
2. Silver: Anne Ottenbrite (Canada) - 1:10.69
3. Bronze: Catherine Poirot (France) - 1:10.70[1][3][6]

The final was held on August 2, 1984, at the McDonald's Olympic Swim Stadium[1]. This victory marked the first time a Dutch swimmer had won gold in this event at the Olympics[5].

The competition was notable for the absence of swimmers from the Eastern Bloc countries due to their boycott of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics[6]. This allowed for a more open field and potentially impacted the final results and times.
