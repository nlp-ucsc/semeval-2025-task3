Before it was renamed Valrico, the region was known as Long Pond[1][3][5]. This name originated from the pre-Civil War era when the area consisted of several cotton plantations[2][5]. 

The area surrounding what is now Valrico Lake was first called "Long Pond," and consequently, the entire region adopted this name[1]. Long Pond, also referred to as Lake Hunter by some, is a 55-acre gourd-shaped lake located north of State Road 60, south of Wheeler Road, and west of Valrico Road[3].

The transition from Long Pond to Valrico occurred in the 1880s when William G. Tousey, a philosophy professor from Tufts College in Boston, purchased property in the area[2][3][5]. Impressed by the landscape, which at the time featured orange groves and pine forests, Tousey renamed the area Valrico, a Spanish term meaning "rich valley"[3][5].

It's worth noting that some sources mention the area was also known as "Valle de Oro" (Valley of Gold) in Spanish, which may have influenced Tousey's choice of the name Valrico[4][7]. However, the most consistently reported previous name across multiple sources is Long Pond.
