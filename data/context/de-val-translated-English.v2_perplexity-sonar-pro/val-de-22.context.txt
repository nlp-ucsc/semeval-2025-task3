Diageo, a British multinational alcoholic beverages company, produces the Captain Morgan rum brand[1][2]. The brand has an interesting history:

1. Origins: The Captain Morgan brand was originally created by Seagram Company, a Canadian multinational, in 1944[1][2][3].

2. Acquisition: In 2001, Diageo acquired the Captain Morgan brand as part of its purchase of several Seagram's assets[4].

3. Production locations: While initially produced in Jamaica, production has moved over the years:
   - 1950s: Shifted to Puerto Rico[3][4]
   - 2010: Diageo opened a new distillery in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands[3]

4. Global presence: Under Diageo's ownership, Captain Morgan has become one of the most popular rum brands worldwide, sold in over 100 countries and selling approximately 12 million cases annually[4][5].

5. Product range: Diageo has expanded the Captain Morgan line to include various rum expressions, including the flagship Original Spiced Rum, Black Spiced Rum, White Rum, and several flavored variants[2][4].

Captain Morgan's success under Diageo is evident in its market position. As of 2007, it was the second-largest brand of spirits by volume in the United States and the seventh-largest worldwide[1][2]. The brand continues to be a significant part of Diageo's portfolio, with ongoing product innovations and marketing efforts.
