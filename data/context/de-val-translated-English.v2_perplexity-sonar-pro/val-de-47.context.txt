Johnny Cash's first single to reach number 1 on the American country charts was "I Walk the Line"[1][3]. This iconic song was recorded on April 2, 1956, and released on May 1, 1956[3]. It quickly climbed to the top of the country charts, spending six weeks at number 1 during the summer of that year[5]. 

"I Walk the Line" was not only Cash's first chart-topper but also his first crossover hit, reaching No. 17 on the pop charts[3]. The song was included on Cash's debut album "With His Hot and Blue Guitar" and was released as the third single from that album, backed with "Get Rhythm" on the B-side[1].

This breakthrough hit came after Cash had moderate success with his previous singles. His debut single "Cry! Cry! Cry!" reached No. 14 on the country charts, while his follow-up "So Doggone Lonesome" peaked at No. 4[1][3]. However, it was "I Walk the Line" that truly established Cash as a rising star in the country music scene[2].

The success of "I Walk the Line" marked the beginning of Cash's illustrious career, paving the way for numerous other hits and solidifying his place as one of the most influential American musicians of the 20th century[4].
