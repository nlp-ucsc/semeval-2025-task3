Ludhiana was founded in 1480 by members of the Lodhi dynasty, which ruled the Delhi Sultanate from 1451 to 1526[1][2][3]. Specifically, two Lodhi chiefs named Yusuf Khan and Nihang Khan (also spelled Nihand Khan) were sent by Sultan Sikandar Lodhi to restore order in the region[1][2].

According to the legend:

1. Yusuf Khan and Nihang Khan camped at a village called Mir Hota, which was the site of present-day Ludhiana[1][2].

2. Yusuf Khan crossed the Sutlej River to establish Sultanpur and deal with plunderers in the Jalandhar Doab[1][2][4].

3. Nihang Khan remained at Mir Hota and founded the new town on that site[1][2][4].

The city was originally named "Lodhi-ana," meaning "town of the Lodhis," which later evolved into the current name Ludhiana[1][2]. Some sources specifically credit Nihang Khan as the founder of Ludhiana[4][7].

It's worth noting that the area has a rich history predating the Lodhi foundation:

- The region was ruled by various dynasties, including the Yodhas (1st to 4th century) and Rajputs[4].
- During the Tughlaq dynasty's rule, a fort was built at the site of modern Ludhiana[1].
- The original settlers, known as Ludhianavis, are said to have arrived in the 9th century[4].

The Lodhi Fort (Purana Qila) is the only surviving structure from the Lodhi period and was declared a state-protected monument in 2013[1].
