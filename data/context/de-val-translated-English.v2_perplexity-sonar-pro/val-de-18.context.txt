The space station Mir was in orbit for 15 years and 32 days, from February 20, 1986 to March 23, 2001[1][3]. During its time in space, Mir completed 86,331 orbits around the Earth[1].

Some key details about Mir's time in orbit:

1. Orbital characteristics:
   - Average perigee: 354 km (220 mi)
   - Average apogee: 374 km (232 mi)
   - Average orbital speed: 27,700 km/h (17,200 mph)
   - Orbital period: 91.9 minutes
   - Orbits per day: 15.7[1]

2. Longevity records:
   - Mir was the first continuously inhabited long-term research station in orbit.
   - It held the record for the longest continuous human presence in space at 3,644 days, until surpassed by the International Space Station on October 23, 2010[1].

3. Occupancy:
   - Mir was occupied for a total of 4,592 days out of its 5,511 days in orbit[1].
   - It was continuously occupied for almost 10 years, from September 1989 to August 1999[3].

4. Distance traveled:
   - Over its lifetime, Mir traveled approximately 2.2 billion miles in orbit[6].

5. Visitors:
   - More than 100 people from 12 countries visited Mir during its operational lifetime[4].

Mir significantly exceeded its planned lifespan. It was initially designed for only a five-year mission but remained in service for three times that long[3][4]. This extended operation allowed for numerous scientific experiments and invaluable data on long-duration spaceflight, paving the way for future space stations like the International Space Station.
