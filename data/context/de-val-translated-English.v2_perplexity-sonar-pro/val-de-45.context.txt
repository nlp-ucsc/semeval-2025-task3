Based on the search results provided, the Duke of the Alemanni until 695 was Gotfrid (also known as Gotefrid, Gottfried, or Gottfried).

Gotfrid ruled as the Duke of Alemannia (Alamannia) in the late 7th century until his death in 709[1][2]. He was from the house of Agilolfing, which was the dominant ruling family in Bavaria at the time[2].

Key points about Gotfrid's rule:

1. He was active as Duke of Alamannia from approximately 679 to 708[2].

2. In the year 700, Gotfrid donated the castle of Biberburg to the monastery of Saint Gall, as documented in Cannstatt[1][2].

3. Gotfrid fought a war to maintain his de facto independence against Pepin of Heristal, the Mayor of the Palace[2].

4. When Gotfrid died in 709, his sons Lantfrid and Theudebald succeeded him as co-rulers, with the support of Pepin[1][2].

5. Gotfrid was married to a daughter of Theodo of Bavaria, and they had several children, including Odilo (who later ruled Bavaria), Huoching, and a daughter named Regarde[2].

It's worth noting that after Gotfrid's death, the political landscape changed. His son Theudebald became the sole Duke of Alamannia in 730, but was later deposed by Charles Martel in 732[1]. The Alemanni were eventually fully incorporated into the Frankish empire, losing their independence[6].
