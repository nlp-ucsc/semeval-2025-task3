Dinah Madani's superior in the American TV series "The Punisher" is Carson Wolf. Wolf is introduced as Madani's superior at Homeland Security when she returns to the United States after serving in Afghanistan[5]. However, it's important to note that Wolf is not simply a straightforward authority figure:

1. Wolf's role is more complex than just being Madani's boss. He is involved in covering up certain events and forbids Madani from pursuing certain lines of investigation[1][4].

2. As the series progresses, it's revealed that Wolf has connections to the conspiracy that Frank Castle is investigating. This puts him at odds with both Madani and Castle[4].

3. Wolf's true nature is eventually exposed when Castle tortures and kills him, learning that the death of Castle's family was part of a larger attempt to eliminate Castle[4].

4. After Wolf's death, Rafael Hernandez becomes Madani's new superior. Madani informs Hernandez about the ongoing investigation and the connections she has uncovered[4].

It's worth noting that Madani's relationship with her superiors is a significant aspect of her character development throughout the series. Her determination to uncover the truth often puts her at odds with the official stance of her department, leading to tension with figures like Wolf and later interactions with higher-ups in the government[4][7].
