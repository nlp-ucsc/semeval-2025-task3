Ted Lange played the role of Isaac Washington, the bartender, on the popular TV series "The Love Boat"[1][2][3]. He portrayed this character for 250 episodes throughout the show's run from 1977 to 1986[1][3].

As Isaac Washington, Lange was a key member of the main cast, serving drinks and often lending a sympathetic ear to passengers aboard the Pacific Princess cruise ship. His character was known for his friendly demeanor and signature smile, becoming one of the most recognizable faces of the series[1].

Lange's portrayal of Isaac was significant not only for its popularity but also because he was the only Black member of the main cast[2]. This role helped establish Lange as a well-known television actor and became his most iconic character throughout his career.

Interestingly, although Lange played a bartender on screen, he had never professionally tended bar before taking on the role. After the first year of the series' success, he actually attended bartending school to learn the proper techniques and skills of the trade, bringing more authenticity to his performance[7].
