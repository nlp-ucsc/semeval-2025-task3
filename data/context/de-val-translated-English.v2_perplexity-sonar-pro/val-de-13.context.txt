Gianrico Carofiglio was elected to the Italian Senate, which is the upper house or second chamber of the Italian Parliament, in 2008 and served as a senator for 5 years until 2013[1][2][3]. 

Specifically:

- He was elected as a senator in 2008[1][2][3][4].
- He served one full term in the Senate from 2008 to 2013[1][2][3][4][7].
- During this period, he was a member of the Democratic Party[4].

Prior to his election to the Senate, Carofiglio had already been involved in anti-Mafia efforts in the Italian government. In 2007, he was appointed as an advisor to the anti-Mafia committee in the Italian Parliament[1][7]. This appointment likely contributed to his subsequent election to the Senate the following year.

After completing his 5-year term as senator in 2013, Carofiglio did not seek re-election. He instead returned to his work as a magistrate and continued his successful career as a novelist[4].
