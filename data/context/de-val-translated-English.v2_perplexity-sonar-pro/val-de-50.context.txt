Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, has a seating capacity of 64,628 for football games[1][3]. This includes 5,876 club seats and 92 luxury suites[1][3]. 

However, the stadium's capacity can vary depending on the event:

1. For soccer matches, the capacity is typically around 20,000 but can be expanded as needed[4].

2. During concerts, the capacity can be even higher. For example, an Ed Sheeran concert in July 2023 set the record for attendance at Gillette Stadium with 71,723 fans[4][7].

3. Before renovations in 2014, the stadium's capacity was slightly higher at 68,756[4].

It's worth noting that Gillette Stadium replaced the older Foxboro Stadium, which had a smaller capacity of just over 60,000[6]. The current stadium, opened in 2002, represents a significant upgrade in terms of both capacity and amenities.

Gillette Stadium is known for its consistent sell-out crowds, particularly for New England Patriots games. Every Patriots home game has sold out since the team moved to this venue[5]. The stadium also serves as the home for the New England Revolution soccer team and has hosted various other events, including concerts and college football games.
