A Soviet submarine ran aground off Karlskrona, Sweden on October 27, 1981[1][2]. This incident became known as "Whiskey on the Rocks" due to the submarine being a Whiskey-class vessel[2].

The submarine, designated S-363 (also known as U137), was discovered on the morning of October 28, 1981, by a local fisherman in the Karlskrona archipelago[1][2]. It had run aground approximately 10 km (6.2 miles) from Karlskrona, which was the location of one of Sweden's largest naval bases[2].

The incident was particularly significant because:

1. The submarine had entered Swedish waters without permission[1].
2. It had run aground in a restricted military zone, very close to an important Swedish naval base[1].
3. The area where the submarine ran aground was one of only two routes that could be used to move large ships from the Karlskrona naval base to open water[2].

The Swedish government decided to keep the submarine on the rocks until they could establish its country of origin and the reason for its presence in Swedish territory[1]. This led to a tense diplomatic situation between Sweden and the Soviet Union, with the Swedish government demanding explanations and the right to inspect the vessel[1][4].

The Soviet submarine's commanding officer claimed that all their navigation aids had failed simultaneously and that they believed they were near Bornholm, not in Swedish waters[1]. However, this explanation was met with skepticism given the submarine's location deep within Swedish territory[4].

This incident had significant implications for Sweden's perception of its neutrality and security during the Cold War, serving as an "eye-opener" that Sweden could not remain isolated from the tensions between the superpowers[1].
