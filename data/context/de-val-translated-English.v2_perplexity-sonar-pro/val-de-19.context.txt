Dave Franco has two brothers: James Franco and Tom Franco.

James Franco is the eldest of the three brothers, born in 1978. He is a well-known actor, director, and artist who gained widespread recognition for his roles in films like "Spider-Man," "127 Hours," and "The Disaster Artist"[1][2].

Tom Franco is the middle brother, born in 1980. While not as famous as his siblings in the acting world, Tom is an accomplished artist and entrepreneur. He runs the Firehouse Art Collective and is known for his work in visual arts, particularly sculpture[1][2].

Dave Franco is the youngest of the three, born in 1985. He has established himself as a successful actor in his own right, starring in films such as "21 Jump Street," "Now You See Me," and "The Disaster Artist"[1][4].

The Franco brothers grew up in Palo Alto, California, in what Dave described as a "weird and artsy" household. Their parents were both painting majors in college, and their mother, Betsy Franco, is a writer[1]. This creative upbringing likely influenced all three brothers to pursue careers in the arts.

While James and Dave have collaborated on films like "The Disaster Artist," Dave initially wanted to distance himself from his older brother professionally to establish his own identity in the industry[1]. Despite this, the brothers speak positively about each other and have a close relationship[1].
