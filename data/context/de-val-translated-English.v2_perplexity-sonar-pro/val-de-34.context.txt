The Polish city of Toruń was relocated a few kilometers to the east in the 13th century primarily due to the risk of flooding at its original location. Here are the key details:

1. Original founding: The Teutonic Knights first established Toruń in 1231 at a ford through the Vistula River, building a castle and an urban settlement[1][2].

2. Relocation reason: The original site was at risk of recurrent flooding from the Vistula River[1][4][5].

3. New location: In 1236, just a few years after its initial founding, the town was moved approximately 10 kilometers east to its present location[1][2].

4. Geographical advantages: The new site was situated on a knoll about 18 meters above the level of the Vistula, providing better protection against flooding[2].

5. Development: After relocation, Toruń developed rapidly. The Old Town was granted an urban charter in 1233, and the New Town developed from 1264[3].

6. Strategic importance: The new location allowed Toruń to become an important commercial center, benefiting from its position at the intersection of major trade routes[2][3].

This relocation proved to be a wise decision, as it allowed Toruń to grow into a significant medieval European trading and administrative center, eventually becoming a leading member of the Hanseatic League in the territories ruled by the Teutonic Order[3].
