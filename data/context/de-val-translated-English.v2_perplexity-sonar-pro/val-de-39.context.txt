Proturans (members of the class Protura) are the hexapods that do not have antennae[1][4][5]. These small, primitive arthropods have several unique characteristics:

1. Lack of antennae: Unlike most other hexapods, proturans completely lack antennae[1][4].

2. Size and habitat: Proturans are tiny (0.5 - 2.0 mm) and live in moist environments, typically in humus and leaf mold of temperate deciduous forests[1][4].

3. Sensory adaptation: Instead of antennae, proturans use their front pair of legs as sensory organs. These legs are usually held in front of the body[1][4].

4. Other distinctive features:
   - No eyes[1][4]
   - Unpigmented bodies[4]
   - Anamorphic development (they add abdominal segments as they molt)[1][4]

5. Classification: Proturans belong to the subphylum Hexapoda but are not considered true insects. They are part of the group Entognatha, along with Collembola (springtails) and Diplura[5].

6. Ecological role: Proturans are decomposers, feeding on organic matter released by decay. They play a role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems[4].

7. Distribution: There are approximately 3 families and 20 species of proturans in North America, and 4 families with about 500 species worldwide[4].

It's worth noting that while proturans are the only hexapods completely lacking antennae, they have evolved alternative sensory mechanisms to interact with their environment, primarily using their modified front legs.
