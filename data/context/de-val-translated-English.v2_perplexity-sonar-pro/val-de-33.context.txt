The title of the head of the Sakya school in Tibetan Buddhism is "Sakya Trizin" (Tibetan: ས་སྐྱ་ཁྲི་འཛིན།, Wylie: sa skya khri 'dzin)[10]. This title literally means "Sakya Throne-Holder" and is traditionally given to the leader of the Sakya lineage, one of the four main schools of Tibetan Buddhism[1][2].

The Sakya Trizin is considered a highly respected figure in Tibetan Buddhism, second only to the Dalai Lama in the spiritual hierarchy[3]. This position has been passed down within the Khön family since the founding of the Sakya school in 1073 by Khön Könchok Gyalpo[10].

Some key points about the Sakya Trizin:

1. Succession: The leadership alternates between the Drolma and Phuntsok Podrangs (palaces) of the Khön family[1][2].

2. Current leadership: As of 2024, the 43rd Sakya Trizin is Gyana Vajra Rinpoche, officially known as Kyabgon Gongma Trizin Rinpoche[10].

3. Recent changes: In 2017, the 41st Sakya Trizin, who had the longest reign of over 50 years, passed the throne to his son, who became the 42nd Sakya Trizin[6].

4. Responsibilities: The Sakya Trizin is responsible for preserving and propagating the teachings of the Sakya school, particularly the Lamdré ("Path with Its Fruit") teachings[1][2].

The Sakya Trizin plays a crucial role in maintaining the rich traditions and profound philosophical teachings of the Sakya lineage, ensuring its continuity and relevance in the modern world.
