Hamilton Academical lost to Airdrieonians in the decisive playoff final in 2023, resulting in their relegation to Scottish League One (the third tier of Scottish football)[1][4].

The playoff final was a two-legged affair:

1. In the first leg on May 17, 2023, Airdrieonians won 1-0 at home[4].

2. The second leg on May 20, 2023, at Hamilton's New Douglas Park, ended 2-1 to Hamilton after extra time, making the aggregate score 2-2[4].

3. The tie then went to a penalty shootout, which Airdrieonians won 6-5[4].

This result meant Hamilton Academical were relegated to League One, marking their first appearance in the third tier of Scottish football since 2005[1]. It was a significant decline for the club, as they had been relegated twice in the space of three seasons, falling from the Scottish Premiership in 2021 to League One by 2023[2].

The relegation was particularly painful as it came against their Lanarkshire derby rivals Airdrieonians, adding a local dimension to the playoff final[1][4].
