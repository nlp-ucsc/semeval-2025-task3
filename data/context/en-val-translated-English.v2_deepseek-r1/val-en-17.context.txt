Yes, that's correct! The previous name of Gillette Stadium was indeed Foxboro Stadium. Gillette Stadium, located in Foxborough, Massachusetts, is the home stadium of the New England Patriots (NFL) and the New England Revolution (MLS). It opened in 2002, replacing the old Foxboro Stadium, which was their home from 1971 to 2001. The name change occurred when Gillette acquired the naming rights as part of a sponsorship deal.
