Yes, the Bleeding Kansas confrontations occurred between 1854 and 1859. They were a series of violent events in the Kansas territory, primarily driven by the debate over whether Kansas would enter the Union as a free or slave state. This period was marked by clashes between pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions, earning it the name "Bleeding Kansas."

Key events included the sack of Lawrence by pro-slavery forces in 1856 and the Pottawatomie massacre, where abolitionist John Brown and his followers killed five pro-slavery settlers. These events were part of the larger tensions leading up to the American Civil War.

The Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which allowed the territories to decide on slavery through popular sovereignty, exacerbated the conflict. The violence subsided with the admission of Kansas as a free state in 1861, but the underlying issues contributed significantly to the start of the Civil War.
