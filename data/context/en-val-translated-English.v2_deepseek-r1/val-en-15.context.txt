It seems like you're referring to a bird species known as the white-winged chough. However, there appears to be some confusion because the white-winged chough, *Corcorax melanoramphos*, is a species of bird in the family Corvidae, native to Australia. It was indeed described by John Gould, a prominent English ornithologist, in 1837. Gould made significant contributions to the field of ornithology and described many Australian bird species during his career. If you have any more specific questions about the white-winged chough or John Gould's work, feel free to ask!
