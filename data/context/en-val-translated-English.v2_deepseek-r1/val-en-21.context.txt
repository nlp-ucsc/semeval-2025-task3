A Kremlin is indeed a fortified complex typically found in historic Russian cities, often serving as the administrative and defensive heart of the city. The term "detinets" is an old Russian word that refers to a similar structure, essentially a citadel or fortress. Both structures were crucial for the protection and governance of their respective cities, reflecting the historical and architectural significance of these fortified complexes in Russian history.
