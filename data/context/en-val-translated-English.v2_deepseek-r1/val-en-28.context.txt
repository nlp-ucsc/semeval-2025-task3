Your statement is accurate in that William John Little is often recognized for his contributions to the understanding and treatment of cerebral palsy. However, it's important to note that his work laid the groundwork, but the term "cerebral palsy" itself was not used during his time.

1. **William John Little**: In 1861, Little published a paper titled "On the Deformities of the Human Frame," where he described a condition he called "cerebral paralysis," which is now recognized as a form of cerebral palsy. Little studied and treated children with motor disabilities and emphasized the importance of early intervention and physical therapy.

2. **Modern Understanding**: The term "cerebral palsy" was introduced later by Sir William Osler in 1887, combining Little's work with other neurological observations. Modern medicine has expanded our understanding, classifying cerebral palsy into various types and associating it with brain development issues, often occurring during pregnancy, birth, or early childhood.

In summary, while Little was a pioneer, the term and comprehensive understanding of cerebral palsy evolved over time through contributions from multiple medical professionals.
