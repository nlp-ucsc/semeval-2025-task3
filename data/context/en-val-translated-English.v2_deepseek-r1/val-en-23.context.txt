The municipality of Delley-Portalban in Switzerland was established on January 1, 2005, following the merger of the former municipalities of Delley and Portalban. This merger aimed to streamline administrative processes and enhance local governance by combining the resources and services of the two previously separate municipalities. The union has likely contributed to improved infrastructure development and a stronger sense of community within the region.
