That's correct! Captain Morgan is a popular brand of spiced rum that was indeed introduced by the Seagram Company in 1944. The brand is named after Sir Henry Morgan, a Welsh pirate, privateer, and cidade (governor of Jamaica in the late 17th century). The original recipe for Captain Morgan comes from a distillery in Kingston, Jamaica, and the brand has since become widely recognized for its distinctive flavor profile, which typically includes a blend of Caribbean rum, spices, and other ingredients like vanilla and cinnamon. Over the years, the brand has expanded to include various flavored rums and extensions, solidifying its place in the spirits industry. üëç
