Windows Neptune was a canceled operating system project by Microsoft that was intended to be a successor to Windows 98. It was designed to be a consumer-oriented version based on the Windows NT kernel, which would have made it more stable and secure than the previous consumer editions of Windows. Neptune was part of the Windows NT family, aiming to bring the reliability of the NT kernel to home users.

The development of Neptune began in 1999, and it was expected to include enhanced multimedia features, a refreshed user interface, and better hardware support. However, the project faced several challenges, including the ambition of unifying the consumer and business operating systems. This led Microsoft to shift its strategy, merging the Neptune project with the Windows Odyssey project, which was intended to be the next major release after Windows 2000.

The result of this merger was Windows XP, which was released in October 2001. Windows XP combined the consumer-friendly features of Neptune with the stability of the Windows NT kernel, creating an operating system that could cater to both home users and business environments. Neptune itself remained an unreleased prototype, marking a significant step in Microsoft's transition towards a unified Windows platform.
