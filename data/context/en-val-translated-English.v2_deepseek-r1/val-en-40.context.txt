That's correct! The Swedish Navy, known as the **Marinen**, was indeed founded on **June 7, 1522**, by King **Gustav Vasa**. This marked a significant step in establishing Sweden as a major maritime power, especially during the era of the **Kalmar Union** and the subsequent conflicts in the region.

The founding was largely a response to the need for a stronger naval presence to protect Sweden's coastline and trade routes from external threats. Initially, the navy was focused on defending the coastlines, but over time, it grew into a formidable force, playing a crucial role in many conflicts, such as the **Great Northern War** and the **Swedish Empire's** expansion.

In modern times, the Swedish Navy continues to play an important role in defending the country's sovereignty, participating in international peacekeeping missions, and contributing to NATO operations through partnerships.
