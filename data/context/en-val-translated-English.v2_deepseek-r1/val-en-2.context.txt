It seems like you're referring to the Erysiphales, which is an order of fungi commonly known as powdery mildews. This order is indeed part of the class Leotiomycetes in the Ascomycota phylum. However, the number of genera within the Erysiphales has been subject to revision and may differ depending on the source.

Currently, the Erysiphales order is believed to contain about 19-20 genera, including well-known genera like Erysiphe, Sphaerotheca, Oidium, and Podosphaera, among others. These fungi are obligate parasites that infect a wide range of plants, causing the characteristic powdery mildew symptoms. They are economically significant, particularly in agriculture, as they can cause substantial damage to crops like grapes, grains, roses, and cucurbits.

Taxonomic studies within this group often involve molecular phylogenetic analyses because morphological differences among species can be subtle. Researchers continue to refine the classification of these fungi to better reflect their evolutionary relationships.
