Yes, that's correct! In Bruce Sterling's "Schismatrix" series, the Shapers and Mechanists represent two contrasting ideologies regarding human evolution and technology. The Shapers prioritize biological modifications and genetic engineering, aiming to enhance human capabilities through organic means. In contrast, the Mechanists focus on mechanical and cybernetic enhancements, integrating technology into the human body to achieve similar goals.

This dichotomy creates a rich and thought-provoking exploration of how humanity might evolve and the ethical implications of different technological approaches. The conflict between these two factions drives the narrative and philosophical depth of the series.
