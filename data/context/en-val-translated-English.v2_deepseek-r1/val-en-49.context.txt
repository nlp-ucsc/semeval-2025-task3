Carl Löwenhielm was born in 1796. His father, Georg Adlersparre, was indeed a significant figure in Swedish history. Georg Adlersparre was not only a military officer but also a notable politician and one of the leaders of the coup d'état in 1809, which led to the adoption of a new constitution and the downfall of King Gustav IV Adolf. Adlersparre's political influence and military career had a profound impact on Carl Löwenhielm's upbringing and likely shaped his own interests and career path. Carl Löwenhielm went on to serve as a Swedish diplomat and was involved in various diplomatic missions, reflecting the strong foundational influence of his father's career and legacy.
