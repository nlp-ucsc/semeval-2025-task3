Yes, I'm familiar with that. The municipalities of Gampel and Bratsch in Switzerland were indeed merged in 2013 to form the new municipality of Gampel-Bratsch. This merger is part of a broader trend in Switzerland where smaller municipalities combine to streamline administrative tasks, reduce costs, and enhance regional cooperation. The merger aimed to improve the delivery of public services and strengthen the local economy while preserving the unique characteristics of each former municipality. If you have any specific questions about this merger or its impacts, feel free to ask!
