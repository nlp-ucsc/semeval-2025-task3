That's correct! Toruń, a city in northern Poland, became a member of the Hanseatic League around the late 13th century, specifically joining the league circa 1280. The Hanseatic League was a powerful mercantile and cultural organization that dominated trade in Northern Europe, particularly in the Baltic region, during the Middle Ages. Membership in the league brought significant economic benefits to Toruń, as it gained access to extensive trade networks, privileges, and a robust system of commercial cooperation.

The league's trade network stretched from the Baltic to the North Sea and included major trading hubs like Lübeck, Danzig (Gdańsk), and Bruges. Toruń's strategic location on the Vistula River made it an important center for trade, especially in goods such as grain, timber, and textiles. The city's merchants enjoyed privileges like tax exemptions, preferential treatment in legal matters, and the ability to trade freely within the league's network, which greatly boosted its economy and influence.

Toruń's association with the Hanseatic League played a crucial role in its development, transforming it into a prosperous medieval city. It was also a time of cultural and architectural flourishing, as evidenced by the city's well-preserved medieval architecture, including the famous Toruń Old Town, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
