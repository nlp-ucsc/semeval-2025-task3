It seems there's a bit of confusion in your statement. Let me clarify:

FC Zhenis was a football club based in Astana (now known as Nur-Sultan), Kazakhstan. The club was renamed to FC Astana in 2009. FC Astana does indeed play its home games at the Astana Arena (also known as the Nur-Sultan Arena) in Nur-Sultan, which is the capital of Kazakhstan.

FC Astana has been quite successful, winning multiple Kazakhstan Premier League titles and competing in European competitions like the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League. The club's success has helped raise the profile of football in Kazakhstan both domestically and internationally.
