That's not accurate. The 1986 Biathlon World Championships were actually held in Oslo, Norway, but I believe you may be referring to the host city and year correctly. However, let me provide more details to ensure the information is complete. The Championships took place from February 18 to February 22, 1986. They featured several events, including the 20 km individual, 10 km sprint, 4x7.5 km relay for men, and the 10 km individual and 5 km sprint for women. Norway's Eirik Kvalfoss and Tichka Tchikova of Bulgaria were among the notable competitors that year. If you need more specific information about medal winners or event outcomes, please let me know!
