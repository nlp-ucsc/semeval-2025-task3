It's true that not all arthropods have antennae. Many arthropods, including insects and certain crustaceans, possess antennae which serve as vital sensory organs. However, other groups within the arthropod phylum, such as chelicerates (which include spiders and scorpions), do not have antennae. This absence is a distinguishing characteristic among these arthropod groups, highlighting the diversity within the phylum.
