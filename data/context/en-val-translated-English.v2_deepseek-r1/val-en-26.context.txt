Yes, the Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI) is indeed an active and maintained resource. It is part of the Web of Science Core Collection, managed by Clarivate Analytics (formerly known as Thomson Reuters). The AHCI is a bibliographic database that indexes a wide range of academic journals in the arts and humanities, providing researchers with access to comprehensive citation data and tools for tracking the impact of scholarly work. This resource is particularly valuable for those conducting research in fields such as literature, history, philosophy, and the arts, as it facilitates the discovery of relevant literature and the analysis of research trends and influence.
