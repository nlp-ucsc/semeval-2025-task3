When you cut an onion, you release enzymes that break down into irritating gases. These gases react with the water in your eyes to form sulfuric acid, which causes a burning sensation and leads to tearing. Your eyes produce tears to flush out the irritant and protect themselves. 

This process is a natural defense mechanism of the onion to deter predators, using chemical compounds that are irritating to animals, including humans. While some people are more sensitive than others, the tearing is a universal response to the chemical irritation caused by the onion's defense compounds.
