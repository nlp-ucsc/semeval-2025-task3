The connection between Nahavand and Laodicea lies in their historical significance during the Crusades. In 1118, the Crusader king Baldwin II of Jerusalem was captured by the Artuqid Turks near Lahlore. He was held captive in several locations, including Nahavand and Laodicea ad Lycum. The term "Laodicea" might refer to this city, known for its Christian history, where Baldwin was imprisoned before his eventual escape or release. This event highlights the broader context of conflicts and alliances during the medieval period in the Middle East.
