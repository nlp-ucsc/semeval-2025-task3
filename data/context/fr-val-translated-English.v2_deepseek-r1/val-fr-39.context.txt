Booker T. Washington's invitation to the White House in 1901 by President Theodore Roosevelt was significant for several reasons:

1. **Historical Precedent**: It marked the first time an African American was invited to the White House for a social visit, symbolizing a breakthrough in race relations during a time of heightened racial segregation and discrimination.

2. **Symbol of Progress**: The invitation was seen as a nod to Washington's prominence as a leader in the African American community and his advocacy for gradual, accommodationist approaches to racial equality.

3. **Controversy and Backlash**: The visit sparked controversy, particularly among Southern politicians and newspapers, who saw it as an inappropriate breach of racial etiquette. This backlash highlighted the deep-seated racial tensions of the era.

4. **Roosevelt's Stance**: President Roosevelt's action demonstrated his willingness to challenge social norms, even as he faced criticism for it. It showed a degree of progressive sentiment towards racial issues, though his overall record on race was complex and sometimes contradictory.

5. **Impact on Civil Rights Movement**: While Washington's visit was symbolic, it contributed to ongoing conversations about race and equality. However, it also drew criticism from more radical civil rights activists like W.E.B. Du Bois, who preferred more direct challenges to segregation and discrimination.

In summary, Booker T. Washington's invitation to the White House was a pivotal moment that highlighted both the possibilities and limitations of racial progress during the early 20th century.
