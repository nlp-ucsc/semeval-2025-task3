Captain Morgan is a brand of rum that was created in 1944 by Seagram. The brand is named after Sir Henry Morgan, a famous Welsh pirate who raided Spanish colonies in the Caribbean during the late 17th century. The rum was originally produced in Jamaica and was introduced to the United States in the early 20th century.

The original Captain Morgan rum was a dark rum with a distinctive flavor profile that included notes of vanilla, caramel, and spices. Over the years, the brand has expanded to include a variety of flavored rums, such as spiced rum, coconut rum, and pineapple rum, among others.

The most well-known drink made with Captain Morgan rum is likely the "Captain Morgan and Cola," which is a simple mix of Captain Morgan Original Spiced Rum and cola, often garnished with a lime wedge. This is a popular cocktail that has been promoted extensively by the brand.

It's worth noting that while the Captain Morgan rum was created in 1944, the specific cocktail of mixing it with cola may have become popular later, particularly in the latter half of the 20th century. The exact date for when the "Captain Morgan and Cola" became a standard cocktail isn't as clear, but it's safe to say that it gained widespread popularity during the 20th century.
