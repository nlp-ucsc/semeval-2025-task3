The Ingenuity helicopter, which is part of NASA's Mars 2020 mission, weighs approximately **1.8 kilograms** (about 4 pounds). This makes it the lightest helicopter ever built for such a mission. Its lightweight design is crucial for its operation on Mars, where the atmosphere is much thinner than Earth's, requiring the helicopter to generate lift with much less air.
