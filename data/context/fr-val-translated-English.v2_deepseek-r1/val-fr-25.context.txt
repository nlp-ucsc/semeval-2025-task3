The city of Khobar (also spelled Khubr or Khobar) is not actually located in Bahrain. It seems there might be some confusion. If you're referring to Bahrain, it's important to note that Bahrain is an island nation in the Persian Gulf, and while it has several important cities like Manama (the capital), Muharraq, and Riffa, Khobar is not among them. Khobar is actually a city in Saudi Arabia, located near the border with Bahrain.

If you meant Khobar in Saudi Arabia, it is significant for Bahrain as well because of the close proximity and the King Fahd Causeway, which connects Khobar with Bahrain. This causeway is a vital transportation link, facilitating trade, tourism, and commuting between the two countries. It also underscores the strong economic and cultural ties between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.
