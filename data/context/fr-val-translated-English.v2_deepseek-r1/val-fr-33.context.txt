In Zoroastrianism, the Towers of Silence, also known as Dakhmas, play a significant role in the funeral rites of the community. They are open-air structures where the dead are placed to be exposed to scavenging birds, typically vultures, which consume the flesh. This practice is rooted in the belief that earth, fire, and water are sacred elements that must not be defiled. By using the Towers of Silence, Zoroastrians ensure that the corpse does not pollute these elements. After the birds have stripped the flesh from the bones, the remaining skeletal remains are typically collected and buried or disposed of in a manner that avoids contamination of the natural elements. This method of disposal is considered both environmentally respectful and in accordance with Zoroastrian religious principles.
