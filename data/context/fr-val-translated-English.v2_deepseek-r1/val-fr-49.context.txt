The historical figure sometimes associated with the legend of La Llorona (The Weeping Woman) is **Malinche** (also known as Malintzin or Doña Marina), an indigenous woman who served as a translator and advisor to the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés during the conquest of Mexico in the early 16th century.

### Connection to La Llorona:
1. **Tragic Love Story**: Like La Llorona, Malinche is often portrayed in stories as a woman caught between two cultures. She became romantically involved with Cortés and had a child with him, but their relationship was fraught with tragedy. Some accounts suggest that Cortés eventually rejected her in favor of a Spanish woman, leading to her heartbreak.
   
2. **Loss of a Child**: In some versions of the La Llorona legend, the ghost is doomed to wander rivers and lakes weeping for her drowned children. Similarly, Malinche’s son with Cortés was sent to Spain, and she was separated from him. This separation adds to the tragic narrative often linked to La Llorona.

3. **Cultural Symbolism**: Both figures symbolize the clash of cultures during the conquest of Mexico. La Llorona is often seen as a symbol of the suffering of indigenous peoples, and Malinche, as a translator and mediator, became a controversial figure in Mexican history.

While Malinche is not universally identified as La Llorona, the parallels in their stories have led some to link the two in folklore and literature. However, it's important to note that La Llorona is a broader legend with many variations, and not all stories directly tie her to Malinche.
