In Homer's *Odyssey*, the tales told at the palace of King Alcinous are found in **Books 9 through 12**. These books are part of Odysseus' recounting of his adventures after he is welcomed by Alcinous and the Phaeacians.

Here's a breakdown of what happens in each of these books:

- **Book 9**: Odysseus tells the story of his encounter with the **Cyclops Polyphemus**, including how he and his men escaped by blinding the giant.

- **Book 10**: He recounts his journey to the **land of the Lotus-Eaters** and his time with **Aeolus**, the king of the winds, who provided him with a bag of winds to aid his journey but was later betrayed by his crew.

- **Book 11**: Odysseus describes his visit to the **Underworld**, where he spoke with the prophet **Tiresias** and saw the shades of various heroes, including his mother and the tragic figure of **Odysseus' mother**.

- **Book 12**: He tells of his encounters with the **Sirens**, **Scylla**, **Charybdis**, and the **cattle of the Sun**, which his men irresponsibly slaughtered, leading to their downfall.

These stories showcase Odysseus' cunning, bravery, and the various challenges he faced on his journey home to Ithaca. His tale ends in Book 12, after which the Phaeacians, moved by his story, decide to help him return home.
