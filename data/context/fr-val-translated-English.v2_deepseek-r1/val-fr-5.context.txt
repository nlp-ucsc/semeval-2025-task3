During childbirth, various positions can be adopted to make the process more comfortable and efficient. Here are some common positions:

1. **Lithotomy Position**: This is the most common position, where the woman lies on her back with legs raised and supported by stirrups. It allows easy access for medical interventions.

2. **Semi-Seated Position**: The woman sits up at a 30-40 degree angle, supported by pillows. This can help with breathing and may ease discomfort.

3. **Side-Lying Position**: Lying on one side with the other leg bent and supported by a pillow. This can improve blood flow and reduce pressure on the lower back.

4. **Kneeling Position**: Kneeling on the bed or floor, leaning forward, can create space in the pelvis and make pushing easier.

5. **Standing Position**: Standing and swaying or rocking can help with contractions and positioning of the baby.

6. **Squatting Position**: Squatting during pushing can open the pelvis and assist in moving the baby down the birth canal.

Each position has its benefits, and the choice depends on the individual's comfort and medical guidance.
