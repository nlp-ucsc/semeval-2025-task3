The Bandundu Province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was divided as part of a broader administrative reform in the country. The reform, which was enacted in 2015, aimed to split the existing 11 provinces into 26 new provinces, largely following the lines of the provinces that existed prior to a 2005 constitutional amendment.

Specifically, the division of Bandundu Province occurred in 2015 when it was split into three smaller provinces:

1. **Kwilu Province**
2. **Maisons-Namur Province** (though this name was later changed to **Kongo Central**)
3. **LÃ©opoldville Province** (which was later renamed to **Kinshasa** and is now a separate city-province)

These changes were part of an effort to decentralize governance and improve administrative efficiency by creating smaller, more manageable provinces that better reflect the country's linguistic and cultural diversity.
