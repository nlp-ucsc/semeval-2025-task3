The first Sakya Trizin was Khon Kagyudpa Chenpo, also known as Khon KÃ¶nchok Kyab. He was a prominent figure in Tibetan Buddhism and the first holder of the Sakya Trizin title, which signifies the throne holder of the Sakya lineage. Khon Kagyudpa Chenpo lived in the 11th century and was instrumental in establishing the Sakya Monastery, one of the most important institutions of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism. The Sakya Trizin lineage has continued through his descendants, making it unique among Tibetan Buddhist lineages as it combines both spiritual and familial succession.
