Yes, the European Union promotes the concept of sustainable cities through several institutions, initiatives, and programs. Among the key institutions and efforts are:

1. **European Commission**: The European Commission, particularly through its Directorate-General for Environment and Directorate-General for Energy, actively supports sustainable urban development. It has launched various initiatives to encourage cities to adopt sustainable practices, such as the European Green Capital Award and the European Green Leaf Award, which recognize cities for their environmental achievements.

2. **Covenant of Mayors**: The Covenant of Mayors is a European initiative that brings together mayors and local authorities committed to implementing the EU's climate and energy goals. It helps cities develop and implement sustainable energy and climate action plans.

3. **European Investment Bank (EIB)**: The EIB provides financing for sustainable urban projects, such as green infrastructure, renewable energy, and sustainable transport, supporting cities in their transition to sustainability.

4. **Urban Agenda for the EU**: This is a framework aimed at strengthening the role of cities in EU policy-making. It includes partnerships focused on various urban challenges, including sustainable use of land, urban mobility, and green cities.

5. **Horizon Europe and EU Research Programs**: The EU funds research and innovation programs that address urban sustainability, such as smart cities, sustainable transportation, and energy efficiency in buildings.

6. **European Environment Agency (EEA)**: The EEA provides support to cities by offering data, indicators, and assessments on environmental issues, helping them to monitor progress and implement sustainable policies.

These institutions and initiatives reflect the EU's comprehensive approach to promoting sustainable cities across its member states.
