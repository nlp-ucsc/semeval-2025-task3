The term "molecular biology" was coined by **Warren Weaver**, an American scientist and administrator, in the 1930s. Weaver, who was the director of the natural sciences program at the Rockefeller Foundation at the time, used the term to describe the emerging field that focused on understanding biological phenomena at the molecular level. He sought to emphasize the intersection of biology, chemistry, and physics in this new area of research. This term gained popularity and eventually became the widely recognized name for the discipline that studies the structure, function, and processes of biological molecules.
