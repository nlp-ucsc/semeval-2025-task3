Yes, capacity-based suffrage can be seen as a restriction on the right to vote. Suffrage refers to the right to vote in elections, and when it is capacity-based, it means that only individuals who meet certain criteria related to their abilities, knowledge, or social standing are granted this right. This can effectively exclude large portions of the population from participating in the democratic process. Here are some ways in which capacity-based suffrage restricts the right to vote:

1. **Exclusion of Marginalized Groups**: Historically, capacity-based suffrage has been used to disenfranchise marginalized groups such as racial minorities, women, and the poor. For example, literacy tests and property ownership requirements were often used in the past to prevent certain groups from voting, effectively limiting suffrage to the privileged classes.

2. **Limitations Based on Education or Intelligence**: Capacity-based suffrage often implies that only those deemed 'competent' or 'educated' enough can participate. This can be problematic because assessments of competence can be subjective and biased, potentially excluding individuals who may not have had equal access to education but are still capable of making informed decisions.

3. **Restriction of Universal Suffrage**: Universal suffrage, which grants the right to vote to all citizens above a certain age, is a cornerstone of modern democracy. Capacity-based suffrage deviates from this principle by imposing additional barriers, thereby restricting the universality of the right to vote.

4. **Potential for Abuse**: Capacity-based suffrage can be abused by those in power to maintain their control over the political process. By setting specific and potentially arbitrary criteria, ruling elites can limit the electorate to those who support their policies, undermining the fairness and representativeness of elections.

5. **Contradiction with Democratic Principles**: Modern democratic principles emphasize inclusivity and equality. Restricting the right to vote based on capacity can be seen as a contradiction to these principles, as it denies many citizens a voice in the governance of their country.

In contrast to capacity-based suffrage, many modern democracies have moved towards universal suffrage, recognizing the importance of equal participation in shaping a representative government. However, debates about the role of capacity and competence in voting continue, especially in discussions about issues like voter ignorance and the quality of political decision-making.
