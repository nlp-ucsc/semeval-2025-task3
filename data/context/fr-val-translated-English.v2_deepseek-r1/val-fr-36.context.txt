No, palmitoleic acid is not only of plant origin. While it can be found in various plant-based sources, it is also present in animal-derived products. For instance, it is found in macadamia nuts, olive oil, and other plant sources, as well as in fish like mackerel and in human tissues. However, the amounts and sources may vary.
