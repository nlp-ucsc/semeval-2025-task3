The U.S. Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) oversees several Regional Health Commands and Direct Reporting Units. Based on the search results provided, here's a detailed breakdown:

Regional Health Commands (RHCs):

MEDCOM is divided into Regional Health Commands that oversee day-to-day operations and exercise command and control over Medical Treatment Facilities in their regions. Currently, there are four Regional Health Commands:

1. Regional Health Command-Europe
   - Includes Landstuhl Army Medical Center in Germany and other hospitals and installations[1]

2. Regional Health Command-Central[1]

3. Regional Health Command-Pacific
   - U.S. Army Public Health Command-Pacific is a direct-reporting unit of Regional Health Command-Pacific[10]

4. Regional Health Command-Atlantic (inferred, as it's not explicitly mentioned in the search results but is typically part of the MEDCOM structure)

Direct Reporting Units (DRUs):

As of 2017, MEDCOM itself was listed as a Direct Reporting Unit to the Department of the Army[2]. However, MEDCOM has its own subordinate units:

1. U.S. Army Public Health Center (USAPHC)
   - Previously known as the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion & Preventive Medicine (USACHPPM)[1]

2. U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC)
   - Formerly known as the Medical Research, Development, Acquisition and Logistics Command (MRDALC)[1][3]

3. U.S. Army Medical Department Center & School (AMEDDC&S)
   - Now renamed as the Army Medical Center of Excellence[1]

It's important to note that as of October 1, 2019, significant changes occurred in the structure of Army medicine:

- Operational and administrative control of all military medical facilities transitioned to the Defense Health Agency[1]
- Logistics and materiel research and supply have been assigned to United States Army Materiel Command[1]
- Medical training is now the responsibility of Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC)[1]
- Walter Reed National Military Medical Center was transferred to the direct control of the Defense Health Agency[1]

Additionally, the U.S. Army Medical Command manages a budget of more than $12.8 billion and provides medical care to Army personnel[8]. It is one of 11 direct reporting units in the Army[8], emphasizing its importance in the overall Army structure.
