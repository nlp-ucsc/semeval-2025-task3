Galicia, located in northwestern Spain, has distinct geographical and climatic characteristics:

## Geography

Galicia's terrain is characterized by a contrast between coastal areas and inland regions[1]:

- The coast features low-altitude relief with 1,500 kilometers (930 mi) of coastline[1].
- Inland areas have higher altitudes, forming the Galician Massif[1].
- The region covers 29,574 km² (11,419 sq mi)[4].

Key geographical features include:

- Numerous rivers and tributaries draining seaward[3].
- Firth-like inlets along the coast called "rías", divided into Rías Altas and Rías Baixas[4].
- Several mountain ranges, including Serra do Eixe, Serra da Lastra, and Serra do Courel in the east[1].
- Over 316 islands, islets, and rocks along the coast, including the Cíes Islands[1].

## Climate

Galicia has a mild climate influenced by its Atlantic location[2][4]:

- Average temperatures range from 7°C (45°F) in January to 18°C (64°F) in August[2].
- Coastal areas have more moderate temperatures compared to inland regions[2].
- Annual precipitation is high, exceeding 1,000 mm (40 inches) in most places[3].

The climate is classified into two main types[4]:

1. Warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb) in the south (Ourense and Pontevedra provinces).
2. Oceanic climate (Cfb) in the western and northern coastal regions (Lugo and A Coruña provinces).

Key climate characteristics:

- Mild winters with consistent rainfall[4].
- Snow is rare at sea level but common in eastern mountains from November to May[4].
- Summers are relatively cool on the coast, with average daily maximums around 25°C (77°F) in Vigo[4].
- Inland areas like Ourense experience hotter summers[4].

Climate data for major cities (1981-2010 average)[4]:

| City | July Avg. Temp | January Avg. Temp | Annual Rainfall | Sunny Hours |
|------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| A Coruña | 19.0°C (66.2°F) | 10.8°C (51.4°F) | 1,014 mm (39.9 in) | 2,010 |
| Lugo | 18.2°C (64.8°F) | 6.2°C (43.2°F) | 1,052 mm (41.4 in) | 1,821 |
| Ourense | 22.5°C (72.5°F) | 8.0°C (46.4°F) | 811 mm (31.9 in) | 2,054 |
| Pontevedra | 20.4°C (68.7°F) | 9.6°C (49.3°F) | 1,613 mm (63.5 in) | 2,247 |

The combination of Atlantic influence, varied topography, and abundant rainfall contributes to Galicia's lush, green landscape, earning it the nickname "Green Spain"[10].
