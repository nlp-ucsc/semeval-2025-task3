The World Chess Federation, officially known as FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs), has several key responsibilities as the governing body of international chess:

1. Organizing Major Tournaments: FIDE is responsible for organizing and overseeing major international chess competitions, including the World Chess Championship, Chess Olympiad, and other prestigious events[1][4]. These tournaments are crucial for determining world champions and promoting chess at the highest level.

2. Establishing and Maintaining Rules: FIDE sets and standardizes the rules of chess for international play. This includes regulations for game play, tournament formats, and equipment standards[2][3].

3. Rating System: FIDE manages the international chess rating system, known as the Elo rating system. This system provides a standardized method for assessing players' skill levels globally[2][4].

4. Awarding Titles: The federation awards international chess titles such as Grandmaster (GM), International Master (IM), FIDE Master (FM), and others. These titles recognize players' achievements and skill levels[2][3][4].

5. Promoting Chess Education: FIDE supports educational initiatives to teach chess at various levels, from schools to community programs. This effort aims to spread awareness about the cognitive benefits of chess and inspire new generations of players[1].

6. Ensuring Fair Play: FIDE implements measures to prevent cheating and promote ethical behavior in chess competitions. This includes the use of anti-cheating technology and establishing ethical guidelines for players[1].

7. Arbitration and Dispute Resolution: The federation acts as an arbiter in chess-related disputes and has an Ethics Commission to investigate allegations of misconduct or rule violations[7].

8. Cooperation with National Federations: FIDE works with nearly 200 national chess federations worldwide, coordinating efforts to promote and develop chess globally[4].

9. Olympic Recognition: As the body recognized by the International Olympic Committee for chess, FIDE works to maintain chess's status as a sport and promote its inclusion in multi-sport events[3][4].

10. Development Programs: FIDE runs various development programs aimed at increasing chess participation and improving the level of play worldwide[10].

By fulfilling these responsibilities, FIDE aims to promote chess as a sport, art, and science while fostering a global community of chess players and enthusiasts.
