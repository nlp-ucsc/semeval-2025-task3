Zhejiang cuisine, one of China's eight major culinary traditions, is renowned for its fresh, light flavors and emphasis on seafood. Some of the most famous dishes of Zhejiang cuisine include:

## West Lake Fish in Vinegar Gravy (西湖醋鱼)

This iconic dish features grass carp cooked in a sweet and sour vinegar sauce[1][3]. The fish is typically kept alive in clear water for two days before preparation to ensure freshness[4]. It's then delicately poached and served with a sharp, vinegar-based sauce that perfectly complements the tender fish[4].

## Dongpo Pork (东坡肉)

Named after the famous Song Dynasty poet Su Dongpo, this dish consists of succulent, slow-cooked pork belly braised in Shaoxing rice wine and soy sauce[1][3]. The pork is incredibly tender and flavorful, with a perfect balance of lean and fatty meat[4].

## Longjing Shrimp (龙井虾仁)

This elegant dish combines river shrimp with the famous Longjing (Dragon Well) tea leaves[1][3]. The shrimp are stir-fried quickly to maintain their fresh, delicate flavor, while the tea leaves impart a subtle, aromatic taste[7].

## Beggar's Chicken (叫花鸡)

This legendary dish involves wrapping a whole chicken in lotus leaves and clay, then slow-roasting it to achieve a tender and aromatic result[1][3]. According to folklore, it was invented by a hungry thief who had to cook a stolen chicken secretly[1].

## Other Notable Dishes

- Fried Eel Slices (生爆鳝片): Swamp eel coated in paste, stir-fried, and served with garlic, sugar, and vinegar[5].
- Steamed Grass Carp in Vinegar (西湖醋鱼): Similar to West Lake Fish, but specifically using grass carp[4].
- Sister Song's Fish Soup (宋嫂鱼羹): A soup made with Chinese perch, ham, bamboo shoots, shiitake mushrooms, egg, and chicken stock[5].

Zhejiang cuisine is characterized by its use of fresh ingredients, particularly seafood, and cooking methods that preserve the natural flavors of the food. The cuisine emphasizes healthful cooking approaches, using less oil and salt while maintaining nutritional value[3]. With its delicate flavors and artistic presentation, Zhejiang cuisine has become a favorite among food connoisseurs both in China and around the world.
