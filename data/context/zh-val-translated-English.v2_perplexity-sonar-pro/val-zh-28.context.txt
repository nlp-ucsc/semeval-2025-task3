Fungi of the order Erysiphales, commonly known as powdery mildew fungi, have developed several strategies to survive and propagate:

1. Asexual reproduction: Powdery mildew fungi primarily reproduce asexually through conidia (asexual spores)[1][6]. These conidia are produced on conidiophores and can be easily dispersed by air currents, allowing for rapid spread and infection of new host plants[5].

2. Sexual reproduction: Erysiphales also reproduce sexually through the formation of chasmothecia (formerly called cleistothecia)[1][5]. These structures contain asci with ascospores, which are important for overwintering and initiating new infections in the spring[1][6].

3. Overwintering strategies:
   - Chasmothecia: These sexual structures are dark, round, and thick-walled, protecting the fungus from UV radiation and freezing temperatures during winter[1].
   - Dormant mycelium: Some powdery mildew fungi can survive as dormant mycelium within plant buds[6].
   - Living hosts: In greenhouse environments, these fungi often survive between crop cycles on living plants or weedy hosts[5].

4. Host-pathogen interactions:
   - Superficial mycelium: Erysiphales typically grow on the surface of host plants, developing specialized structures called haustoria to penetrate epidermal cells and extract nutrients[3][6].
   - Effector proteins: These fungi secrete effector proteins that manipulate plant physiology and suppress host defense responses, allowing them to establish and maintain infections[7].

5. Adaptive mechanisms:
   - Rapid evolution: Powdery mildew fungi can quickly overcome plant immunity, develop fungicide resistance, and expand their host range[8].
   - Genomic plasticity: Their genomes are highly adaptable, with transposable elements playing a key role in shaping genomic architecture and potentially encoding novel virulence factors[8].

6. Environmental adaptations:
   - Low moisture requirement: Unlike many fungi, powdery mildew conidia do not require free moisture on plant surfaces to germinate and infect[5].
   - Optimal greenhouse conditions: These fungi thrive in greenhouse environments, which often provide ideal temperature, humidity, and light conditions for their growth and reproduction[5].

7. Host range: Erysiphales have a wide host range, with over 10,000 plant species susceptible to infection, allowing them to persist across diverse ecosystems[8].

By employing these various survival strategies, Erysiphales fungi can persist between growing seasons, rapidly spread during favorable conditions, and adapt to changing environments and host defenses.
