The Portuguese national anthem, "A Portuguesa," was born out of a period of intense national sentiment and political upheaval in Portugal at the end of the 19th century. Its creation and adoption are closely tied to significant historical events and the rise of republican sentiment in the country[1][2][3].

The anthem's origins can be traced back to the British Ultimatum of 1890. On January 11, 1890, the United Kingdom issued an ultimatum to Portugal, demanding that it withdraw from territories between the Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozambique in Africa[1]. This area was part of Portugal's ambition to create a contiguous African empire, as depicted in the "Pink Map"[5]. The Portuguese government's acquiescence to British demands caused widespread outrage and humiliation among the Portuguese people[2][3].

In response to this national crisis, composer Alfredo Keil and lyricist Henrique Lopes de Mendonça collaborated to create "A Portuguesa" as a patriotic protest march[1][2]. The song was composed and written in a remarkably short time, reflecting the urgency of the moment and the intense emotions stirred by the ultimatum[6].

Key aspects of the anthem's background include:

1. Patriotic Response: The song was intended to express the Portuguese people's yearning for national vindication and their wounded pride in the face of British imperialism[1].

2. Republican Symbolism: Although initially created as a patriotic song, "A Portuguesa" quickly became associated with the growing republican movement in Portugal[1][2].

3. Initial Ban: The song's popularity and its adoption by republican sympathizers led to its being banned by the monarchist government in 1891, following a failed republican revolt in Porto where it was used as a marching song[1][3].

4. Revolution and Adoption: Despite the ban, the song remained popular. When the Portuguese monarchy was overthrown in the 5 October 1910 revolution, "A Portuguesa" played a significant role[1]. It was officially adopted as the national anthem of the new Portuguese Republic in 1911, replacing the monarchist "Hino da Carta"[2][3].

5. Original Lyrics: The original lyrics were more explicitly anti-British, with the chorus ending "Contra os bretões marchar, marchar!" (Against the British we march, we march!)[2][4]. This line was later changed to "Contra os canhões marchar, marchar!" (Against the cannons, march on, march on!)[3].

6. Standardization: In 1956, due to the emergence of melodic variants, the Portuguese government established a committee to define an official version. The current standardized version was approved on July 16, 1957[1][2].

The anthem's lyrics and rousing chorus continue to reflect its origins as a call to arms and a symbol of Portuguese resilience and pride[3][5]. Today, "A Portuguesa" remains a powerful expression of national identity, often passionately sung at sporting events and official ceremonies[5].
