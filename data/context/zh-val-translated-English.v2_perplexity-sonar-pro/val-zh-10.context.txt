The clouded Apollo (Parnassius mnemosyne) is not a spider, but a butterfly species. It has a wide distribution across Europe and parts of Asia. Here are the key regions and countries where the clouded Apollo butterfly can be found:

1. Europe:
- The butterfly's range extends from the Pyrenees in the west to central Asia in the east[1][7].
- It is present in many European countries, including:
  - Spain
  - France
  - Italy
  - Norway
  - Sweden
  - Finland
  - Estonia
  - Czech Republic
  - Countries in the Balkans up to northern Greece[1][7]

2. Mountain ranges:
- The species is typically found in mountainous areas, including:
  - The Alps (between Italy and France)
  - The Carpathians
  - The Central Massif[1]

3. Specific regions:
- In Sweden, it is found in three small, geographically isolated regions: Blekinge, Roslagen, and Västernorrland[4].
- In Finland, the best places to look for it are in the Åland Islands[6].
- In Estonia, it occupies three separate areas: west, northeast, and southeast[3].

4. Asia:
- The distribution extends into central Asia[1].
- It is present in some areas of central Asia, such as Sakha (in Russia)[7].

5. Altitude range:
- The clouded Apollo typically inhabits areas from 400 meters up to 2,300 meters above sea level, though it is more common above 1,000 meters[7].

6. Habitat preferences:
- It prefers meadows, woodland clearings, and semi-natural grasslands with plenty of flowering plants[1][3].
- The butterfly favors a mosaic of meadows or semi-natural grassland and pastureland that is managed by grazing or mowing[4].

It's important to note that while the clouded Apollo has a wide distribution, its populations have been declining in many areas. For example, it has gone extinct in Denmark since the early 1960s[4], and its range has contracted in several other countries. Conservation efforts are ongoing in various regions to protect this species.
