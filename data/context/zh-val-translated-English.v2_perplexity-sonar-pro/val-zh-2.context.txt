White Collar is an American crime drama television series that originally aired from 2009 to 2014 on the USA Network. The show follows the intriguing partnership between Neal Caffrey, a charming and highly skilled con artist, forger, and thief, and FBI Special Agent Peter Burke[1][2][3].

The premise of the series begins with Neal Caffrey, portrayed by Matt Bomer, being captured by FBI agent Peter Burke (Tim DeKay) after a three-year game of cat and mouse[3]. Caffrey is convicted and sentenced to four years in prison. However, with only four months left in his sentence, Neal escapes to search for his girlfriend, Kate[3].

After Burke recaptures Caffrey, Neal proposes an unconventional deal: he offers to help the FBI catch dangerous white-collar criminals in exchange for his early release from prison as part of a work-release program[1][3]. Despite initial hesitation, Burke agrees, leading to Neal's release and the beginning of their unique partnership[3].

Throughout the series, Neal works as an FBI consultant and Burke's criminal informant, using his expertise in art, history, and the criminal underworld to solve complex cases[1][2]. The show explores the dynamic between Neal and Peter, as they navigate trust issues, moral dilemmas, and the constant temptation for Neal to return to his criminal ways[1][3].
