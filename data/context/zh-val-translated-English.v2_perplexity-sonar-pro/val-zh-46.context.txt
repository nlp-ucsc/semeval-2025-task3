The protests in Peru from March to April 2022 were caused by several interconnected factors:

1. Rising inflation and economic pressures: The protests occurred amid increasing fertilizer and fuel prices, which were exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent international sanctions imposed on Russia[1]. Peru, being more reliant on imported oil products compared to other nations in the region, was particularly affected by these price increases[1].

2. Dissatisfaction with President Pedro Castillo's government: The protests were partly directed against President Castillo's administration, with demonstrators calling for his resignation[1]. This dissatisfaction was reflected in Castillo's approval rating dropping to 24% by March 2022[1].

3. Transportation sector grievances: The Union of Multimodal Transport Guilds of Peru (UGTRANM), led by Geovani Rafael Diez Villegas, organized some of the larger protests[1]. Their demands included:
   - Removal of passenger restrictions on buses
   - Pardons for transportation workers charged with crimes
   - Negotiations for forgiving debt owed by transportation businessmen to the government[1]

4. Political instability: The protests occurred against a backdrop of ongoing political turmoil, including a failed impeachment attempt against President Castillo on March 28, 2022[1][2].

5. Rural discontent: Inflation of basic goods, alongside increasing fertilizer and fuel prices, angered rural Peruvians, shifting them from their position of supporting Castillo to protesting against his government[1].

6. Allegations of organized opposition: President Castillo initially claimed that the protests were organized by "paid leaders" and had malicious intent, though he later apologized for these statements[1].

7. Ineffective government response: The Castillo government's initial attempts to address the protests, such as suspending a 30% fuel tax, were ineffective as fuel companies refused to lower their prices[1].

These factors combined to create a volatile situation, leading to widespread protests, roadblocks, and in some cases, violent confrontations between demonstrators and security forces[1][3]. The protests escalated to the point where the government declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew in Lima, which was met with further defiance and demonstrations[1][3].
