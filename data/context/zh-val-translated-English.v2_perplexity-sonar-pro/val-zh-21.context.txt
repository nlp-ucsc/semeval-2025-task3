The etymology of rhetoric in Chinese can be traced back to several key terms and concepts that emerged in ancient China:

1. The term "xiūcí" (修辞) is often used as the modern Chinese equivalent of "rhetoric"[1][2]. This term first appeared in the Commentary on I Ching during the Eastern Zhou period, where it referred to a means for a virtuous person (jūnzǐ) to establish sincerity in their morality[2].

2. In classical Chinese texts, several terms were used to describe different aspects of rhetorical practice[3][5]:

   - Yan (言): speech, talks, and the use of language
   - Ci (辞): modes of speech, types of discourse, eloquence, style
   - Jian (谏): giving advice, persuasion
   - Shui/shuo (说): persuasion, explanation, idea, thought
   - Ming (名): naming, symbol using, rationality, epistemology
   - Bian (辩): distinction, change, justice-eloquence, arguments, persuasion, debate, disputation, discussion

3. The compound term "ming bian xue" (名辩学) has been suggested as comparable to the Western study of rhetoric, with "ming" aiming to seek truth and justice, and "bian" concerning the art of persuasion[5].

4. The origins of Chinese rhetoric are generally traced back to the late Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period (770–221 BCE)[2][3]. However, recent research suggests that rhetorical ideas may have existed as early as the Shang dynasty (1600–1046 BCE) or even the Xia dynasty (2070–1600 BCE)[2].

5. Unlike in Western tradition, where rhetoric emerged as a distinct discipline early on, Chinese rhetoric did not gain status as a separate field of study until the early twentieth century[5]. Instead, rhetorical concepts and practices were integrated into various schools of thought, including Confucianism, Mohism, Daoism, and Legalism[5].

It's important to note that the concept of rhetoric in Chinese tradition differs from its Western counterpart. While Western rhetoric often focused on civic oratory and persuasion, Chinese rhetoric was more closely tied to moral cultivation, social harmony, and effective governance[2][3]. This difference in emphasis reflects the distinct cultural and philosophical contexts in which these rhetorical traditions developed.
