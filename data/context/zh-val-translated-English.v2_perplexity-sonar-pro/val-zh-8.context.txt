4. White Rock: Situated to the southeast of Delta[5].

Delta is uniquely positioned with water on three sides:

- Boundary Bay to the south[3]

This geographic location makes Delta a crucial part of the Fraser River delta ecosystem, which includes Burns Bog, the Fraser River Estuary, Boundary Bay, and Roberts Bank[4].
