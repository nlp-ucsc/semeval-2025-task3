Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of disorders that affect movement, balance, and posture. It is caused by damage to or abnormal development of the brain, typically occurring before, during, or shortly after birth. The causes of cerebral palsy are varied and complex, often involving multiple factors. Here's a detailed overview of the main causes:

## Prenatal Causes (Before Birth)

### Brain Development Issues
Damage to the white matter of the brain or abnormal brain development during pregnancy can lead to cerebral palsy[1][4]. This can be caused by:

- Genetic factors (although rare, accounting for about 14% of cases)[10]
- Maternal infections such as toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes[2]
- Exposure to toxic substances during pregnancy[2]
- Maternal medical conditions like thyroid problems or seizures[2][9]

### Vascular Problems
- Stroke in the fetus[4]
- Bleeding in the brain (intracranial hemorrhage)[1][4]

### Other Factors
- Lack of oxygen to the fetal brain due to placental problems or maternal low blood pressure[4]
- Multiple gestations (twins, triplets, etc.)[2]
- Infertility treatments[2]

## Perinatal Causes (During Birth)

### Complications During Labor and Delivery
- Asphyxia (lack of oxygen) during a difficult birth[1][8]
- Premature birth or low birth weight[2][3]
- Abnormal delivery position (e.g., breech)[9]
- Placental complications, such as placental detachment[9]

### Medical Negligence
In some cases, cerebral palsy can result from medical malpractice during delivery, such as:
- Improper use of delivery tools (forceps, vacuum extractors)[1][9]
- Failure to detect fetal distress or perform necessary C-sections[1]

## Postnatal Causes (After Birth)

### Infections
- Meningitis or encephalitis in early infancy[4][8]

### Injuries
- Head trauma from accidents, falls, or abuse[3][4]
- Near-drowning experiences[3]

### Other Factors
- Severe jaundice that goes untreated (kernicterus)[1][7]
- Vascular problems leading to stroke[4]
- Very low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)[8]

It's important to note that in many cases (up to 75% in some estimates), the exact cause of cerebral palsy cannot be determined[6]. Additionally, the presence of risk factors doesn't necessarily mean a child will develop cerebral palsy, and conversely, a child with no known risk factors may still develop the condition[7].

Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for managing cerebral palsy effectively. If you suspect your child may have cerebral palsy or if they have any of the risk factors mentioned, it's essential to consult with healthcare professionals for proper evaluation and care.
