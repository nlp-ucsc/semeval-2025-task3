The three stages of labor are:

## First Stage: Labor and Cervical Dilation

The first stage is the longest and consists of early labor and active labor[1][2]. 

During early labor:
- Contractions begin, starting mild and irregular
- The cervix starts to dilate and efface (thin out)
- This phase can last 6-12 hours for first-time mothers[5]

Active labor then follows:
- Contractions become stronger, longer, and more frequent  
- The cervix dilates from 6 cm to 10 cm (fully dilated)[1][4]
- This typically lasts 4-8 hours[2]

## Second Stage: Pushing and Birth

The second stage begins when the cervix is fully dilated and ends with the birth of the baby[1][3]. Key aspects include:

- Strong urge to push with contractions
- The baby descends through the birth canal
- This stage usually lasts 20 minutes to 2 hours[3]
- Ends when the baby is born

## Third Stage: Delivery of the Placenta

The final stage involves delivering the placenta[1][2]:

- Mild contractions continue after the baby's birth
- The placenta separates from the uterine wall
- It's then pushed out through the vagina
- This stage typically lasts 5-30 minutes[4]

Each stage is crucial for a successful labor and delivery. The duration of each stage can vary significantly between individuals and may be influenced by factors like whether it's a first pregnancy or if pain medication is used[3][4].
