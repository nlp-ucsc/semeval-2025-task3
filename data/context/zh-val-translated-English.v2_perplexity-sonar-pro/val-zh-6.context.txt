The Moscow Kremlin, a symbol of Russian power and history, has roots dating back to the 12th century. The first written record of Moscow itself appears in 1147, marking the beginning of the city's documented history[1][2]. It was around this time that the initial fortifications began to take shape on the site of the present-day Kremlin[1].

In 1156, Prince Yuri Dolgorukiy ordered the construction of the first wooden fortress on the site, establishing what would become the Moscow Kremlin[6][8]. This early structure was likely a simple wooden fence with guard towers, designed to protect the newly founded settlement[9].

The Kremlin's development continued through the centuries, with significant changes and reconstructions:

1. In the 13th century, the Kremlin became the official residence of supreme power, serving as the center of temporal and spiritual life of the state[7].

2. The 14th century saw major upgrades. In 1339-1340, Prince Ivan Kalita rebuilt the fortress with massive oak walls[9]. Later, in the 1360s, Prince Dmitry Donskoy reconstructed the walls using limestone, giving Moscow its famous "White-Walled" appearance[6].

3. The late 15th to early 16th centuries marked a crucial period in the Kremlin's history. Under Ivan III (Ivan the Great), the Kremlin underwent extensive reconstruction. Italian architects were invited to redesign the fortress, resulting in the basic layout we see today[4][8].

4. The stone walls and towers of the present-day Kremlin were erected between 1485 and 1516, establishing it as one of Europe's major fortifications of that time[7].

Throughout its history, the Kremlin has endured invasions, fires, and political upheavals. It has served various roles - from a fortress to a royal residence, and later as the seat of Soviet power and the modern Russian government[2][4]. The Kremlin's evolution from a wooden outpost to a stone citadel reflects the growth of Moscow and the Russian state, making it a living record of Russian history spanning over eight centuries.
