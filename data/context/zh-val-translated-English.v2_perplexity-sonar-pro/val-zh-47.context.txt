Species of the genus Eobania, particularly Eobania vermiculata (the chocolate-band snail), are primarily distributed in the Mediterranean region and have been introduced to various other parts of the world[1][2]. Here's a detailed breakdown of their distribution:

## Native Distribution

Eobania vermiculata is common throughout the Mediterranean area, with its native range extending from:

- Eastern Spain
- Southern Greece
- Eastern Bulgaria
- Crimea in Ukraine
- Israel
- Egypt[1][2]

## Introduced Distribution

The species has been introduced to several regions outside its native range:

1. Europe:
   - Belgium
   - Germany
   - Hungary
   - The Netherlands
   - One individual was found in Lewisham, London, England in 2006[1]

2. North America:
   - United States (established populations in Texas, California, and Louisiana)[1][6]

3. Australia:
   - Southeastern Australia, where it's known as the chocolate-band snail[1][2]

4. Asia:
   - Japan
   - Iran

5. Middle East:
   - Saudi Arabia
   - Jordan

6. Africa:
   - South Africa

7. Other regions:
   - It has also been introduced to suitable habitats in many other parts of the world[4]

## Ecological Significance

It's worth noting that Eobania vermiculata is considered a potentially serious threat as an invasive species in some areas, particularly in the United States. It could negatively affect agriculture, natural ecosystems, human health, or commerce. As a result, it has been suggested that this species be given top national quarantine significance in the USA[1].

The species has shown adaptability to various climates, being able to survive winters in the North-West European temperate zone, including Belgium and The Netherlands[1]. This adaptability contributes to its success as an invasive species in many regions outside its native Mediterranean habitat.
