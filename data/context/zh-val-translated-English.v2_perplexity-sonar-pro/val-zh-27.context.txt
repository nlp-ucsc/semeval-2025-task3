Forces can be classified into several types based on their effects and nature. Here's a comprehensive overview of the main types of forces:

## Contact Forces

Contact forces occur when two objects physically touch each other. These include:

1. **Normal Force**: The perpendicular force exerted by a surface on an object in contact with it[3].

2. **Friction Force**: The force that resists the relative motion of objects in contact[3][7]. It can be further divided into:
   - Static friction: Prevents objects from starting to move
   - Kinetic friction: Acts on objects already in motion

3. **Tension Force**: The force transmitted through a string, rope, cable, or wire when it is pulled tight by forces acting from opposite ends[3].

4. **Applied Force**: Any force that is applied to an object by another object or person[1].

5. **Spring Force**: The force exerted by a compressed or stretched spring[1][5]. It follows Hooke's Law: F = -kx, where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement from equilibrium.

## Non-Contact Forces

These forces act between objects without physical contact:

1. **Gravitational Force**: The attractive force between all objects with mass[1][2][4]. It's described by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation: F = G(m₁m₂)/r², where G is the gravitational constant, m₁ and m₂ are the masses of the objects, and r is the distance between their centers.

2. **Electromagnetic Force**: This force acts between electrically charged particles[2][4][6]. It includes both electric and magnetic forces.

3. **Nuclear Forces**:
   - **Strong Nuclear Force**: The force that binds quarks together to form protons and neutrons, and holds the atomic nucleus together[4][6].
   - **Weak Nuclear Force**: Responsible for certain types of radioactive decay[4][6].

## Fundamental Forces of Nature

Physicists have identified four fundamental forces that govern all interactions in the universe[4][6][8]:

1. Strong Nuclear Force
2. Electromagnetic Force
3. Weak Nuclear Force
4. Gravitational Force

These forces are listed in order of decreasing strength. Despite being the weakest, gravity is the most noticeable in everyday life due to its infinite range and the fact that it always attracts and never repels.

## Other Classifications

Forces can also be categorized based on other criteria:

- **Conservative vs. Non-conservative Forces**: Conservative forces, like gravity and spring force, conserve mechanical energy, while non-conservative forces, like friction, do not.

- **Fundamental vs. Derived Forces**: Fundamental forces are the basic forces of nature, while derived forces (like the normal force or tension) result from these fundamental forces.

Understanding these various types of forces is crucial in physics for analyzing and predicting the behavior of objects and systems under different conditions.
