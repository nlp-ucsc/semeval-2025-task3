Lugdunum, the ancient Gallic city that is now modern-day Lyon, France, was founded in 43 BC[1][4][7]. The city was established by Lucius Munatius Plancus, a Roman general and governor of Gaul, under orders from the Roman Senate[1][4].

The purpose of founding Lugdunum was multifaceted:

1. Roman colonization: It was part of the broader Roman policy of establishing settlements in newly conquered areas to ensure stability and control[8].

2. Resettlement of refugees: The city was founded to provide a new home for a group of Roman refugees who had been expelled from Vienne, a town about 30 km to the south[4][7].

3. Strategic location: Lugdunum was situated at the confluence of two major rivers, the Rhône and the Saône, making it an important center for trade and administration within the Roman Empire[2][4].

4. Political maneuvering: According to the historian Cassius Dio, the Senate's order to found the city was partly motivated by a desire to prevent these refugees from joining Mark Antony's forces during the political conflicts following Julius Caesar's assassination[4].

5. Administrative center: Within 50 years of its founding, Lugdunum grew significantly in size and importance, becoming the administrative center of Roman Gaul and Germany[7].

The establishment of Lugdunum played a crucial role in the Roman expansion and control of Gaul, eventually becoming a vital hub for commerce, politics, and culture in the western part of the Roman Empire[4].
