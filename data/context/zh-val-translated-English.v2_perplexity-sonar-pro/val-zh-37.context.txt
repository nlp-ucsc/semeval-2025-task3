Diplomatic missions are classified into several types based on their functions, the level of representation, and the nature of the relationship between the sending and receiving countries. Here are the main classifications of diplomatic missions:

## Embassies

Embassies are the primary and most common type of diplomatic mission. They are typically located in the capital city of the host country and offer a full range of diplomatic services[1][7]. Embassies are headed by ambassadors, who are accredited to the head of state of the host country[5]. Their main functions include:

- Representing the sending state in the receiving state
- Protecting the interests of the sending state and its nationals
- Negotiating with the government of the receiving state
- Promoting friendly relations between the two countries
- Developing economic, cultural, and scientific relations

## High Commissions

High Commissions are essentially embassies between Commonwealth countries[1][7]. They function similarly to embassies but are headed by High Commissioners rather than ambassadors.

## Permanent Missions

Permanent Missions are diplomatic missions to international organizations such as the United Nations, World Trade Organization, or European Union[1][7]. They represent their country's interests within these multilateral bodies.

## Consulates

Consulates are diplomatic missions usually located in major cities other than the capital. They focus primarily on providing consular services to citizens and handling visa applications[1][3]. There are several types of consulates:

1. Consulates General: Located in major cities, providing a full range of consular services[7].
2. Consulates: Similar to Consulates General but may offer a more limited range of services[7].
3. Honorary Consulates: Headed by Honorary Consuls, typically providing very limited services[3][7].

## Special Missions

Special bilateral or multilateral missions are established for specific diplomatic purposes with a defined endpoint, such as negotiating an agreement[4].

## Other Classifications

1. Legations: Diplomatic establishments headed by ministers rather than ambassadors. These are no longer common[4].

2. Interest Sections: Operate under the protection of a third country when two nations don't have formal diplomatic relations[4].

3. Apostolic Nunciatures: Diplomatic missions from the Vatican to other countries[5].

## Diplomatic Ranks

Within these missions, diplomats are classified into different ranks[8]:

1. Lower ranks: Attaché, Third Secretary
2. Mid-level ranks: Second Secretary, First Secretary
3. Higher ranks: Counsellor, Minister Counsellor, Ambassador

The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 officially recognizes three classes of heads of mission[9]:

1. Ambassadors or nuncios accredited to heads of state
2. Envoys, ministers, and internuncios accredited to heads of state
3. Chargés d'affaires accredited to ministers of foreign affairs

These classifications ensure a structured approach to international diplomacy, allowing countries to maintain various levels of representation and services abroad based on their needs and relationships with host countries.
