The Mir space station was a modular structure consisting of several interconnected components. Here's a detailed overview of its main structural elements:

## Core Module

The Mir Core Module (DOS-7) formed the backbone of the station[1][2][5]:

- Launched on February 19, 1986
- Dimensions: 13.13 m long, 4.15 m diameter, weighing 20.9 tonnes
- Contained living quarters, including a galley, individual crew cabins, and personal hygiene area
- Featured a working compartment for monitoring and commanding core systems
- Equipped with six docking ports for attaching other modules and spacecraft
- Housed main computer, communications equipment, and life support systems
- Provided 90 cubic meters of habitable volume

## Additional Modules

Several modules were added to expand Mir's capabilities[1][3][4]:

1. Kvant-1 (1987):
   - Astrophysics module
   - Primary docking port for Progress vehicles

2. Kvant-2 (1989):
   - Airlock for spacewalks
   - Life support systems

3. Kristall (1990):
   - Materials processing laboratory
   - Docking ports for Buran shuttle (later used for Space Shuttle)

4. Spektr (1995):
   - Geophysical and atmospheric research

5. Docking Module (1995):
   - Brought by Space Shuttle Atlantis
   - Facilitated docking of Space Shuttles

6. Priroda (1996):
   - Earth observation and remote sensing

## External Components

Mir also featured several unpressurized external elements[4]:

- Sofora girder: 14-meter scaffolding structure on Kvant-1
- VDU thruster block: Mounted on Sofora for attitude control
- Rapana girder: 5-meter prototype structure on Kvant-1
- Two Strela cargo cranes: Used for moving objects during spacewalks

## Power and Control Systems

- Solar arrays on various modules for power generation[1][5]
- Control moment gyroscopes for attitude control[4]
- Two main engines (300 kg thrust each) on the Core Module for orbital maneuvers (unusable after Kvant-1 docking)[5]

## Docking Systems

- Multiple docking ports for attaching modules and spacecraft[5]
- APAS-89 docking ports on Kristall module for Space Shuttle docking[4]

The modular design of Mir allowed for flexibility in its construction and expansion, enabling the station to evolve and accommodate various scientific experiments and international collaborations throughout its operational life[3][6].
