Jef Raskin had the following educational background:

- BA in mathematics and BS in physics with minors in philosophy and music from Stony Brook University[1].

- Master's degree in computer science from Pennsylvania State University in 1967[1]. 

- He later enrolled in a graduate music program at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), but quit to teach art, photography, and computer science there instead[1].

- He worked as an assistant professor in the Visual Arts department at UCSD from 1968 until 1974[1].

Jef Raskin received his formal education in mathematics, physics, and computer science, which provided a strong technical foundation for his later work in human-computer interaction and interface design. His interdisciplinary background spanning technical fields as well as arts and humanities likely contributed to his innovative approach to computing and user interfaces. Although he did not complete the music graduate program at UCSD, his time there as both a student and professor exposed him to a range of disciplines that informed his later work.
