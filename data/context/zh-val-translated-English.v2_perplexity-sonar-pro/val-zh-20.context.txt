Ludhiana, a major city in the Indian state of Punjab, has several notable geographical features:

## Location and Elevation

Ludhiana is centrally located in Punjab, situated at 30°54′N 75°51′E[4][6]. The city has an average elevation of 244 meters (801 feet) above sea level[4][6]. It lies between north latitude 30°34' and 31°01' and east longitude 75°18' and 76°20'[1].

## Topography

The topography of Ludhiana is characteristic of an alluvial plain[1][8]. This landscape owes its origin to the depositional work of the Sutlej River[1][8]. The alluvium deposited by the river has been shaped by wind action, resulting in:

1. Small sand dunes and mounds
2. A generally flat terrain with subtle variations

The land gently slopes from east to west, with a gradient of about 2 feet per mile[7][8]. The elevation ranges from approximately 268 meters in the east to 216 meters in the west[7][8].

## River System

The Sutlej River plays a significant role in Ludhiana's geography:

- It forms the northern boundary of the district, separating it from Jalandhar and Hoshiarpur districts[1][10].
- Before 1785, the Sutlej River ran closer to the city, near where the Old Fort now stands[4].
- The river's flood plain is an important geographical division of the district[8].

## Soil and Geology

The soil in Ludhiana is primarily:
- Sandy loam to clayey
- pH ranging from 7.8 to 8.5
- Developed under semi-arid conditions[5]

The ground is composed of yellow sandstone and granite, forming small hillocks, plateaus, and dips[4].

## Vegetation

While the old city has limited vegetation, the newer parts, especially Civil Lines, feature:
- Eucalyptus trees (introduced in the 1950s)
- Gulmohars and jacarandas along avenues
- Some pipal trees in the Old City[4]

## Climate

Ludhiana has a semi-arid climate characterized by:
- Hot summers
- Cold winters
- A brief monsoon season[1]

In conclusion, Ludhiana's geography is defined by its alluvial plain topography, the influence of the Sutlej River, subtle elevation changes, and a mix of natural and introduced vegetation, all contributing to its unique landscape in the heart of Punjab.
