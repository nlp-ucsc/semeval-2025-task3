I apologize, but I don't have enough information from the given search results to answer what books Erdeni Pandita Luvsan-Danzin composed. The search results do not contain any specific mention of this individual or their literary works. To provide an accurate answer, I would need additional sources that discuss Erdeni Pandita Luvsan-Danzin's writings or contributions to Mongolian Buddhist literature.
