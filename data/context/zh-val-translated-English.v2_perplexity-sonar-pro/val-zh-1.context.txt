Petra van Staveren was 18 years old when she participated in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles[1][4].

Born on June 2, 1966 in Kampen, Netherlands[1][4], van Staveren was just over 18 years and 2 months old when she competed in the Olympic Games, which took place from July 28 to August 12, 1984.

At these Olympics, van Staveren achieved remarkable success, winning the gold medal in the women's 100-meter breaststroke event[1][2][3]. Her winning time was 1:09.88, which set a new Olympic record at the time[3][8].

In addition to her gold medal performance in the 100-meter breaststroke, van Staveren also competed in the 200-meter breaststroke event, where she finished 10th overall[1]. She was also part of the Dutch 4x100-meter medley relay team, though they were disqualified in the preliminary round[3].

Van Staveren's Olympic victory at such a young age was a significant achievement in her swimming career and for Dutch swimming in general. Her performance contributed to the Netherlands' overall medal count at the 1984 Olympics, where the country won a total of 13 medals, including 5 gold medals[3].
