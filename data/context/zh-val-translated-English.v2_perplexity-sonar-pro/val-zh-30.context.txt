The largest Buddha statue in Cave 96 of the Mogao Caves, built in 695, is 35.5 meters (116 feet) tall[1][3][4]. This colossal statue was constructed under the orders of Empress Wu Zetian during the Tang Dynasty to strengthen her reign and align herself with Buddhist clergy[3][5]. 

Cave 96, also known as the Great Buddha Cave, is one of the earliest large Buddha caves at Mogao[1]. The statue inside is the largest Buddha figure in the Mogao Caves complex[4]. It was originally housed in a wooden building that was four stories high, but over the centuries, the structure has been repaired and expanded multiple times[2]. Currently, the modern facade of the cave is nine stories tall[3].

This impressive Buddha statue is not only notable for its size but also for its historical and cultural significance. It represents the patronage of Buddhism by the imperial court during the Tang Dynasty and showcases the advanced sculptural techniques of the time[5][6].
