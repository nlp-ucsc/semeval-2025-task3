Arthropod antennae are paired, segmented appendages attached to the head that serve important sensory functions. Here are the key characteristics of arthropod antennae:

Structure:
- Antennae are composed of multiple jointed segments[1][7]
- They typically consist of three main parts: the basal scape, the pedicel, and the flagellum[4][7]
- The flagellum is made up of multiple segments called flagellomeres[3][7]

Functions:
- Primarily used for sensory purposes, including:
  - Smell/chemoreception (detecting odors and pheromones)[3][6]
  - Touch[3][4]
  - Detecting air motion and vibrations[4][6]
  - Heat sensing[4]
- In some species, antennae may be adapted for other functions like swimming, mating, or anchoring[7]

Types and variations:
- Antennae come in many different forms across arthropod groups, including:
  - Filiform (thread-like)[3][4]
  - Setaceous (bristle-like)[3][4] 
  - Moniliform (beaded)[3][4]
  - Serrate (saw-like)[3][4]
  - Pectinate (comb-like)[3][4]
  - Clavate (club-shaped)[4]
  - Lamellate (plate-like)[3][4]
  - Plumose (feather-like)[3][4]
  - Aristate (with bristle)[7]

Distribution across arthropod groups:
- Most arthropods have one pair of antennae[7]
- Crustaceans typically have two pairs - antennules and antennae[7]
- Chelicerates (e.g. spiders, scorpions) and proturans lack antennae[7]
- Insect antennae are highly diverse in form and often used for taxonomic classification[3][4]

Sensory capabilities:
- Contain sensory neurons connected to the brain, specifically the deutocerebrum[3]
- May have specialized sensory structures like Johnston's organ in insects[4][7]
- Allow detection of chemical signals, mechanical stimuli, and in some cases sound vibrations[3][6]

The diversity in antennal structure and function across arthropod groups reflects their adaptations to different ecological niches and sensory requirements. The antennae play a crucial role in how arthropods perceive and interact with their environment.
