I apologize, but I don't have any specific information about products launched by Tekali Company in the search results provided. The search results don't mention Tekali Company or any products associated with it.

Without specific information about Tekali Company, I cannot provide details about their product launches. If you have any additional information or context about Tekali Company, I'd be happy to help further.
