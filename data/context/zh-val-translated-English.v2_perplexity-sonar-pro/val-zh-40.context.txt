The AHCI is a comprehensive and multidisciplinary database that indexes over 1,700 leading arts and humanities journals[3]. It also includes relevant items from approximately 6,800 major science and social science journals[1][2]. This broad coverage allows researchers to explore connections between different fields and discover related research across disciplines.

The index contains over 2.5 million records[1], with coverage dating back to 1975[3]. It includes various types of publications such as original research articles, reviews, editorials, chronologies, abstracts, scripts, letters, meeting abstracts, errata, poems, short stories, plays, music scores, excerpts from books, bibliographies, filmographies, and book reviews[3].

By covering such a diverse range of disciplines and publication types, the Arts & Humanities Citation Index serves as a valuable resource for researchers, scholars, and students working in or across various fields within the arts and humanities.
