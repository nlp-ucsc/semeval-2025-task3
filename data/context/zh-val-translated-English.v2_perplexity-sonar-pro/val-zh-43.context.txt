Pasteur Crater is a large impact crater located on Mars with the following key physical characteristics:

1. Size and shape:
- It has a diameter of approximately 116 kilometers[1].
- The crater is roughly circular in shape, as is typical for impact craters.

2. Location:
- Pasteur Crater is situated on the Martian surface.

3. Interior features:
- The crater floor contains dark sand dunes, particularly clustered in the southwest area[1][4].
- Small, isolated dark dunes are located on material deposited within the crater[5].
- There is evidence of wind-blown (aeolian) dunes superposed on wind-blown ripples[1].

4. Geological processes:
- The presence of dunes indicates ongoing aeolian (wind-driven) processes shaping the crater interior.
- Recent observations have shown extensive changes in sand deposits near the dunes, signifying widespread bedform migration[6].

5. Surrounding terrain:
- The source of the dark sand within the crater might be local, possibly originating from smaller impact craters inside Pasteur that excavated sediments[1].

6. Scientific interest:
- The crater has been a target for scientific observation, including high-resolution imaging by Mars orbiters like Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO)[1][9].
- It provides valuable insights into Martian geology, climate, and surface processes.

7. Comparison to lunar craters:
- While Pasteur Crater is on Mars, it's worth noting that there is also a Pasteur Crater on the Moon, which is larger at about 233 kilometers in diameter[2]. This lunar crater has different characteristics due to the Moon's distinct environment and geological history.

The Pasteur Crater on Mars serves as an important site for studying Martian surface processes, particularly aeolian activity and sediment transport, providing valuable data for understanding the planet's current and past environmental conditions.
