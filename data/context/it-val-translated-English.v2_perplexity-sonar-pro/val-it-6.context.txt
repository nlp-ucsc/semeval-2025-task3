The Committee on Fetus and Newborn, along with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), has issued recommendations regarding water birth. Their key points are:

1. Immersion during the first stage of labor:
   - May be offered to healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies between 37 and 41 6/7 weeks of gestation[3].
   - Can be associated with shorter labor and decreased use of spinal and epidural analgesia[3].
   - Requires rigorous protocols for candidate selection, maintenance and cleaning of tubs, infection control, and monitoring of mothers and fetuses[1][5].

2. Immersion during the second stage of labor (underwater delivery):
   - Is not recommended due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy[1][3].
   - Should be considered an experimental procedure only to be performed within appropriately designed clinical trials with informed consent[5][6].
   - Has not been associated with proven maternal or fetal benefits[1][5].

3. Potential risks of underwater delivery:
   - Higher risk of maternal and neonatal infections[1].
   - Difficulty in regulating the baby's body temperature[1].
   - Increased chance of umbilical cord damage[1].
   - Respiratory distress from the baby inhaling tub water[1].
   - Potential for asphyxia and seizures[1].

4. Recommendations for facilities offering water immersion:
   - Establish strict protocols for candidate selection[1].
   - Maintain and clean tubs and immersion pools properly[1][5].
   - Follow infection control procedures[1][5].
   - Monitor pregnant women at appropriate intervals while immersed[1][5].
   - Have protocols for safely moving women out of tubs if concerns develop[1][5].

5. The AAP's 2022 statement:
   - Cautions against water birth during and past the second stage of labor[4].
   - Cites reports of serious and fatal infectious outcomes in infants[4].
   - Notes the absence of current evidence supporting maternal or neonatal benefits of water birth[4].

In summary, while the committee acknowledges potential benefits of water immersion during the first stage of labor, they recommend against underwater delivery due to safety concerns and lack of proven benefits. They emphasize the need for more research and consider water birth during the second stage of labor an experimental procedure that should only be conducted in controlled clinical trial settings.
