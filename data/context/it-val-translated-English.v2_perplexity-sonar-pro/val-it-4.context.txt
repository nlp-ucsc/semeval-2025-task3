The Red Bull Arena in Salzburg, Austria has a seating capacity of 30,188 spectators[1][2][3]. This capacity was achieved after expansions made for the UEFA Euro 2008 tournament[5]. 

Some key details about the stadium's capacity:

- It was originally built in 2003 with an initial capacity of around 18,000-18,250 seats[1][5].

- For Euro 2008, the stadium was expanded to increase capacity to over 30,000[5].

- The current official capacity for most matches is 30,188[1][2][3].

- For UEFA club competitions, the capacity is slightly lower at 29,520 seats[7].

- Since the 2018-19 season, for Austrian Bundesliga matches only, the upper tier remains closed, limiting capacity to 17,218. This was done to improve atmosphere for domestic games[5].

- The stadium has reached its full 30,188 capacity four times for Salzburg matches[10].

- It is considered one of the largest and most modern stadiums in Austria[7].

So in summary, while the standard full capacity is 30,188, the actual number of seats available can vary slightly depending on the type of match being played. The stadium's capacity has evolved over time through expansions to reach its current size.
