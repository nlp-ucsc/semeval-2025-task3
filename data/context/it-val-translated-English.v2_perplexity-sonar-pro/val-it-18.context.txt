William Gibson co-authored The Difference Engine with Bruce Sterling[1][2][5]. This collaborative novel, published in 1990, is considered a seminal work in the steampunk genre[5]. Gibson and Sterling, both renowned science fiction authors, combined their talents to create this alternate history story set in a Victorian-era Britain where Charles Babbage successfully built his analytical engine, leading to an early information age[1][2].

The novel explores the social, political, and technological ramifications of this pivotal change in history. It features a world where steam-powered mechanical computers, called "Engines," have revolutionized British society[1]. The story is told through multiple interconnected narratives, following characters such as Sybil Gerard, Edward Mallory, and Laurence Oliphant[3].

Gibson and Sterling spent seven years writing The Difference Engine[4]. Their collaboration process was interesting, especially given the technological limitations of the time. They had to ship floppy discs back and forth and use fax machines to share text, as this was before the widespread use of email and file-sharing services[8].

The novel received critical acclaim and was nominated for several prestigious awards, including the British Science Fiction Award, the Nebula Award for Best Novel, and the John W. Campbell Memorial Award[5]. It is widely regarded as one of the founding works of the steampunk genre, influencing numerous subsequent works in literature and other media[5].
