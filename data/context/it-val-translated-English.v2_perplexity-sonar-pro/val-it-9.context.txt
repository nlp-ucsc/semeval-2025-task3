Hamilton Academical Football Club sold their former stadium, Douglas Park, to Sainsbury's supermarket in 1994[1][4][7]. The proceeds from this sale went towards the construction of their new stadium, New Douglas Park, which was built adjacent to the site of the old Douglas Park[1][7]. The original Douglas Park site is now occupied by a Sainsbury's supermarket[4][10].
