Gianrico Carofiglio served as a senator in the Italian Parliament from 2008 to 2013[1][3][6]. Specifically:

- He was elected as a senator for the Democratic Party and served a 5-year term from 2008 to 2013[2][6].

- Prior to becoming a senator, Carofiglio was appointed as an advisor to the anti-Mafia committee in the Italian Parliament in 2007[1][3].

- His time in politics as a senator came after his career as an anti-Mafia prosecutor and judge[2]. 

- Carofiglio has described his 5-year term in politics as a senator as being perhaps even more "bruising" than his time as a prosecutor[2].

- After completing his term in the Senate in 2013, Carofiglio resigned from the judiciary and devoted himself to writing full-time[6].

So in summary, Gianrico Carofiglio served one full 5-year term as a senator in the Italian Parliament from 2008 to 2013, representing the Democratic Party. This political role came after his legal career and before he became a full-time writer.
