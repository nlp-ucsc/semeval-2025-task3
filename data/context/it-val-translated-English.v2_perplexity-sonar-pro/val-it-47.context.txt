Sagar, the capital of Sagar district in Madhya Pradesh, India, is located at an altitude of 1,758 feet (536 meters) above sea level[1][5]. The city is situated on a spur of the Vindhya Range, approximately 172 kilometers (107 miles) northeast of Bhopal, the state capital of Madhya Pradesh[1].

Some additional details about Sagar's geography and elevation:

1. The city has an average elevation of 594 meters (1,949 feet) according to some sources[3]. This slight discrepancy in elevation figures may be due to different measurement points within the city.

2. Sagar lies in an extensive plain broken by low, forested hills[5]. This topography contributes to its elevated position.

3. The city is built around a lake, which is surrounded on three sides by low spurs of the Vindhya Range[5]. This geographical feature adds to the scenic beauty of the area and influences its elevation.

4. Sagar's location places it in a central position within India, with the tropic of cancer passing through the southern part of the district[4].

5. The city's elevated position contributes to its climate, which is characterized as humid subtropical[3]. This results in hot summers, somewhat cooler monsoons, and cool winters.

Sagar's altitude and geographical position make it an important city in the region, offering a blend of natural beauty and urban development at a significant elevation in central India.
