The astronauts on the Mir space station primarily exercised in two modules:

1. The Core Module: This was the first and central module of Mir, launched in February 1986. It contained one of the station's treadmills[7][10].

2. Kvant-2 Module: This module, added later to the station, housed the second treadmill[4].

The Core Module also contained a stationary bicycle for cardiovascular exercise[4]. These exercise devices were crucial for maintaining the health of cosmonauts and astronauts during long-duration spaceflights.

The exercise regimen on Mir typically involved:

- Cycling the equivalent of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) per day
- Running the equivalent of 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) per day[4]

Cosmonauts used bungee cords to strap themselves to the treadmill to simulate the effects of gravity and provide resistance during exercise[4]. This exercise routine was designed to counteract the muscle atrophy and bone density loss that occurs in microgravity environments.

It's worth noting that while these were the primary exercise locations, the modular nature of Mir allowed for some flexibility in equipment placement and usage throughout the station's lifetime.
