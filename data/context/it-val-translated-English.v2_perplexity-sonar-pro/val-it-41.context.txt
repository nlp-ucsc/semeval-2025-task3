The International Chess Federation, commonly known as FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs), was founded on July 20, 1924, in Paris, France[1][4][6]. The number of founding countries is typically reported as 15, though there is some inconsistency in the historical records regarding the exact list.

According to most sources, the 15 founding countries of FIDE were:

1. Argentina
2. Belgium
3. Canada
4. Czechoslovakia
5. Finland
6. France
7. Great Britain (sometimes listed as England)
8. Hungary
9. Italy
10. Netherlands
11. Poland
12. Romania
13. Spain
14. Switzerland
15. Yugoslavia

However, it's worth noting that there is some discrepancy in the historical records regarding Finland's inclusion as a founding member. Some sources indicate that Finland joined slightly later, during the 1925 Zurich Congress[8].

The inconsistency in the records is further highlighted by the fact that official FIDE documents from the 1925 Congress list only 14 countries, omitting Great Britain (likely by mistake) while including Finland[8]. This discrepancy has led to some debate among chess historians about the exact composition of the founding members.

Despite these minor inconsistencies, it is generally accepted that 15 countries were involved in FIDE's foundation, with the core group remaining consistent across most sources[1][4][6]. The formation of FIDE marked a significant milestone in the organization of international chess, establishing a governing body that would oversee global chess competitions and standardize rules for the game.
