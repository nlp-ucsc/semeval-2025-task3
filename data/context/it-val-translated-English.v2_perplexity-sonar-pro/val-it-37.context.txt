I apologize, but I do not have enough information to determine the specific license plate code for the municipality of Cilleruelo de San Mamés. The search results do not provide any details about license plate codes for this particular municipality.

What I can tell you about Cilleruelo de San Mamés based on the available information is:

1. It is a municipality located in the province of Segovia, in the autonomous community of Castile and León, Spain[1].

2. According to a 2004 census, the municipality had a population of 46 inhabitants[1].

License plate codes in Spain typically follow a system based on the province. However, without specific data on Segovia province's coding system or any unique identifiers for Cilleruelo de San Mamés, I cannot provide the exact license plate code for this municipality. To obtain this information, you would likely need to consult official Spanish vehicle registration resources or contact local authorities in Segovia province.
