I apologize, but I don't have specific information about a festival celebrated on the last Sunday of August in the municipality of Ponzone based on the provided search results. The search results don't contain any details about a particular festival in Ponzone on that date.

However, I can share some related information that may be of interest:

1. Ponzone is mentioned in search result [8] as part of an event called "Ferragosto a Cavatore, Ponzone (AL) e picnic a Piancastagna" which took place on August 15, 2023. This suggests that Ponzone does host some summer events, though the specific details of this event are not provided[8].

2. The region where Ponzone is located (Piedmont, Italy) is known for hosting various local festivals and events, especially during the summer months. Many Italian towns and villages have their own patron saint celebrations or harvest festivals in late summer, but without more specific information about Ponzone, I can't confirm any particular event for the last Sunday of August.

3. If you're interested in events in the broader region, you might want to look into festivals in nearby larger towns or cities. For example, search result [9] mentions a guide to Italian feast days and parades in 2024, which could potentially include events in the Piedmont region[9].

To get accurate information about a specific festival in Ponzone on the last Sunday of August, I would recommend contacting the local tourism office or municipality of Ponzone directly. They would have the most up-to-date and accurate information about local events and celebrations.
