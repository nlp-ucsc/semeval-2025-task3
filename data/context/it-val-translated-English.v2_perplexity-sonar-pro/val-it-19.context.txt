Johnny Cash advertised for oil companies in the early to mid-1970s. Specifically:

1. In 1972, Johnny Cash appeared in TV commercials for the American Oil Company (Amoco)[8].

2. In 1973, Cash recorded voice-over radio and TV advertising spots for Standard Oil Company (Indiana) to promote their farm products[1]. This resulted in the "Good Earth" album, which was not commercially available for sale but was used for promotional purposes in 15 Midwestern states[1][3].

3. Also in 1973, Cash appeared in a commercial for Amoco Oil promoting energy conservation during the oil crisis[10]. In this commercial, he spoke about the "spirit of conservation" and encouraged Americans to reduce energy consumption.

4. In the mid-1970s, Cash made commercials for Amoco and STP, which was considered somewhat controversial during the 1970s energy crisis[4].

These advertising endeavors were part of Cash's broader commercial activities during this period, which also included making commercials for other companies like Lionel Trains (1976)[4][7] and later for companies such as Taco Bell (1990)[8] and Nissan (1997)[8].
