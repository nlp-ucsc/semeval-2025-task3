Chris Claremont wrote the series "Prudence & Caution" for Defiant Comics[1][5]. This was a short-lived series consisting of only 2 issues, published in 1994[5]. 

Some key details about "Prudence & Caution":

1. It was a complete 2-issue mini-series[1][7].

2. The artist for the series was Jim Fern[1][7].

3. The story featured an unlikely super-team consisting of Rick (Caution) and Prudence[1].

4. Rick was one of the survivors of an experiment by Plasm's Lorca, gaining super-strength and a symbiotic costume[1].

5. Prudence was described as "the Great Destroyer" with the ability to absorb a person completely - thoughts, body and all[1].

This series was part of Claremont's work outside of Marvel Comics, where he is best known for his extensive run on X-Men titles. It's worth noting that Claremont's involvement with Defiant Comics was relatively brief, as the company itself was short-lived, existing only from 1993 to 1995 before closing due to financial difficulties partly caused by a lawsuit from Marvel Comics[4].
