Several incidents involving Gillette Stadium, home of the New England Patriots, have made headlines in recent years:

1. Death of Dale Mooney (2023-2024)
In September 2023, a tragic incident occurred during a New England Patriots game against the Miami Dolphins at Gillette Stadium. Dale Mooney, a 53-year-old fan from New Hampshire, died following an altercation in the stands[1]. Initially thought to be due to a medical emergency, the case took a turn when criminal charges were filed against two men from Warwick, Rhode Island:

- John Vieira, 59 years old
- Justin Mitchell, 39 years old

Both men were charged with criminal assault and disorderly conduct in connection with Mooney's death[1]. The exact cause of Mooney's death remains under investigation, but the charges suggest that the altercation may have played a role in the tragic outcome. The two men were scheduled for arraignment in January 2024[1].

2. State Trooper Misconduct (2019)
In a separate incident from 2019, a Massachusetts State Police trooper was accused of lewd conduct during a Luke Bryan concert at Gillette Stadium[2]. The off-duty trooper, Andrew Patterson, 32, allegedly performed a lewd act on himself and was involved in an altercation with other concertgoers. He was charged with lewd, wanton, and lascivious conduct[2]. This incident led to his suspension from the police force and an internal investigation.

3. Increased Arrests at Sports Venues (2023)
While not specifically a scandal, it's worth noting that arrests at major sports venues in the Boston area, including Gillette Stadium, saw an increase in 2023. At Gillette Stadium, there were 15 arrests reported in the previous year[5]. This trend highlights ongoing concerns about fan behavior and security at large sporting events.

These incidents have brought attention to security measures and fan conduct at Gillette Stadium, prompting discussions about safety and appropriate behavior at sporting events and concerts.
