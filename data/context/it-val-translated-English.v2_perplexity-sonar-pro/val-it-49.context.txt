Cirrostratus clouds can appear in two main species:

1. Cirrostratus fibratus (Cs fib): This species has a fibrous or hair-like appearance[1][8]. It is characterized by:
   - Thin, wispy strands that are tightly knitted together
   - A texture resembling animal fur or fine hair
   - More consistency and uniformity compared to cirrus clouds
   - Often covering large areas of the sky

2. Cirrostratus nebulosus (Cs neb): This species appears as a uniform, featureless veil across the sky[1][9][10]. It is characterized by:
   - A smooth, fog-like appearance
   - Lack of discernible detail or texture
   - Often covering the entire sky
   - Sometimes so thin it's almost invisible except for the halo effect it can produce around the sun or moon

Both species are composed of ice crystals and are found at high altitudes, typically above 6,000 meters (20,000 feet)[1][9]. While cirrostratus fibratus may show some fibrous texture, cirrostratus nebulosus is completely devoid of distinct features, appearing as a uniform hazy veil.

It's worth noting that cirrostratus clouds, regardless of species, are generally thin enough for the sun's position to be visible through them, which can help distinguish them from other cloud types like altostratus[7]. They are also known for their ability to produce halo phenomena due to the refraction of light through their ice crystals[2][5].
