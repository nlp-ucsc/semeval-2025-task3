The typical antennae of Hymenoptera are classified as geniculate antennae[3][5]. 

Key characteristics of geniculate antennae in Hymenoptera include:

1. An elongated basal segment called the scape[3][5].

2. A bend or "elbow" between the scape and the remaining segments, giving the antenna an angled appearance[3][5].

3. A series of shorter segments following the scape, collectively called the funiculus or flagellum[3].

4. The total number of antennal segments (antennomeres) typically ranges from 4-12 in ants, but can be up to 70 segments in some Hymenoptera[3][5].

5. The funiculus may be simple (filiform) or have segments that gradually enlarge towards the tip (incrassate)[3].

6. In some species, the terminal segments may form a distinct club (clavate antennae)[3].

This geniculate structure allows for great mobility and is characteristic of many Hymenoptera, particularly noticeable in ants, bees, and some wasps[2][3]. The geniculate form is an adaptation that enhances the sensory capabilities of these insects, as antennae are crucial for smell, touch, and in some cases, communication[2].

It's worth noting that while geniculate antennae are typical, there is considerable variation within Hymenoptera. Some groups may have modifications to this basic form, such as pectinate (comb-like) or plumose (feather-like) antennae in certain species[2].
