The exterior shots of June's house in the TV series White Collar were filmed at the Schinasi Mansion, located at 351 Riverside Drive on New York's Upper West Side[1][4]. This magnificent French Renaissance-style residence was built in 1909 for Turkish-born cigarette magnate Morris Schinasi and designed by William B. Tuthill, who is also known for designing Carnegie Hall[1].

Some key details about the Schinasi Mansion and its use in White Collar:

1. It is often touted as being New York's only remaining stand-alone single-family mansion[1][4].

2. The exterior of this 4-story, 41-by-73-foot structure sits on a plot of land with 3,400 square feet of gardens and overlooks the Hudson River[1].

3. The mansion's exterior was used regularly in establishing shots throughout White Collar's six-season run to represent June's palatial home[1][3].

4. While the exterior shots were of the real Schinasi Mansion, the interior scenes were a combination of the actual mansion's interior (used in several episodes, including the pilot) and studio-built sets[1][3].

5. Neal's attic apartment, including his rooftop terrace, did not actually exist in the Schinasi Mansion. The terrace scenes from the pilot were filmed at one of the penthouses of the Windsor Tower residential building at 5 Tudor City Place in Murray Hill. Later, a set recreation of the terrace was built for subsequent episodes[1][3][4].

The Schinasi Mansion has been used in various other productions as well, including the 1994 comedy "Bullets Over Broadway" and episodes of "Damages" and "Royal Pains"[1].
