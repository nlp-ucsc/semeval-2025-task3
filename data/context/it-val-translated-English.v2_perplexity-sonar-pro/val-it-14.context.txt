Pope John Paul II was welcomed in Syria by Gregory III Laham during a historic visit in May 2001[1][3]. Specifically:

- John Paul II arrived in Syria on May 5, 2001[2][5].
- Gregory III Laham, who was the Melkite Catholic Patriarch at the time, was among the religious leaders who greeted the Pope upon his arrival[2][5].
- This visit was significant because John Paul II became the first pope in history to enter a Muslim place of worship - the Great Umayyad Mosque in Damascus[1][3].
- The visit took place on May 6, 2001, during Gregory III Laham's term as Patriarch[1][3].

The warm welcome extended to Pope John Paul II in Syria stood in contrast to the cooler reception he had received earlier in Greece during the same trip[2][5]. The papal visit to Syria was notable not only for its religious significance but also for its political overtones, as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad used the occasion to make controversial statements about Israel[2][5].
