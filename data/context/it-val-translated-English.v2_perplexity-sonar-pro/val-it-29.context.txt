The Erysiphaceae belong to the kingdom Fungi and the class Leotiomycetes[1][5].

Specifically:

Kingdom: Fungi
Division: Ascomycota
Class: Leotiomycetes
Order: Erysiphales
Family: Erysiphaceae

The Erysiphaceae are a family of ascomycete fungi commonly known as powdery mildews[1]. They are characterized by their superficial mycelium that extracts nutrients from host plants through specialized structures called haustoria[4]. Many species in this family cause plant diseases, particularly powdery mildew infections on a wide range of plants[1][2][3].

Some key features of the Erysiphaceae and their classification:

1. They are part of the larger group of ascomycete fungi, which produce spores in sac-like structures called asci[1].

2. As members of the Leotiomycetes class, they typically produce their asci in cup-shaped fruiting bodies called apothecia, though in Erysiphaceae these are usually enclosed in cleistothecia[5].

3. The order Erysiphales, to which Erysiphaceae belongs, contains only this single family[1].

4. The family includes several important genera such as Erysiphe, Blumeria, Podosphaera, and Sphaerotheca, among others[1][4].

5. These fungi are obligate parasites, meaning they require living plant hosts to complete their life cycle[3][4].

The classification of Erysiphaceae within the Fungi kingdom and Leotiomycetes class reflects their evolutionary relationships and shared characteristics with other fungal groups, while also recognizing their unique adaptations as plant pathogens.
