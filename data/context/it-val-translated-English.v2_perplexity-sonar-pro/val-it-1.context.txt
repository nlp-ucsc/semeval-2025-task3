The coat of arms of Galicia is composed of seven silver crosses. These seven crosses are arranged around a golden chalice with a silver host in a field of azure (blue)[1][2].

The seven crosses have historical significance:

1. They represent the seven historic provinces of Galicia[1][5].

2. Originally, the number of crosses was six (three on each side of the chalice) plus a seventh one over the Holy Grail. This arrangement evolved over time[2][4].

3. The crosses were added to the flag from the 15th century as a way to decorate the empty space around the central chalice[2].

4. In some older representations, these crosses have also appeared as stars (symbolizing the 6 Galician Churches: Lugo, Iria, Britonia, Tui, Ourense, and Astorga) or shells (referencing the coat of arms of Corunna)[4].

5. The current official design of the Galician Coat of Arms, established in 1972 by the Royal Academy of Galicia, standardized the use of seven silver crosses surrounding the golden Holy Grail on a blue field[2].

This design is now an integral part of Galicia's official symbols, appearing on the institutional flag and various official documents and buildings[1][7].
