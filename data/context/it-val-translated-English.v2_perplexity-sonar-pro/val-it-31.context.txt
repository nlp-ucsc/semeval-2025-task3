The breeding season of the white-winged chough typically occurs from August to December[1][4][5]. During this period, these highly social birds engage in communal nesting and breeding activities. Here are some key details about their breeding season:

1. Timing: While the main breeding season spans August to December, white-winged choughs may also breed at other times of the year in drier areas, particularly after rainfall[7].

2. Nest building: The entire family group participates in building a large, deep cup-shaped nest made of grass and mud. This process can take several months if there's insufficient mud available[1][4].

3. Egg laying: The female typically lays 3-5 cream-colored eggs with brown and lavender markings[2][4]. In some cases, clutch sizes of up to 10 eggs have been observed[5].

4. Incubation: The incubation period lasts about 19-20 days[7]. All members of the family group take turns incubating the eggs[4].

5. Chick rearing: After hatching, the chicks remain in the nest for about 28 days before fledging[1]. However, they continue to be dependent on the group for food throughout their first winter[8].

6. Extended care: Young birds take four years to reach breeding maturity and stay with their parents during this time, helping with nest building, incubation, and feeding of chicks in subsequent breeding seasons[1][5].

7. Multiple broods: In some cases, the breeding pair may produce two broods per year[7].

It's important to note that successful breeding in white-winged choughs is highly dependent on cooperative group efforts. Larger family groups have a better chance of breeding success, which is why these birds sometimes engage in the unusual behavior of "kidnapping" fledglings from neighboring groups to increase their own group size and improve future breeding prospects[2][4].
