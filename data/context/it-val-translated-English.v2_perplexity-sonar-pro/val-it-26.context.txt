The national anthem of Portugal, titled "A Portuguesa" (The Portuguese), was written by two individuals:

1. Lyrics: Henrique Lopes de Mendon√ßa, a Portuguese poet[1][2][3].

2. Music: Alfredo Keil, a Portuguese composer and painter[1][2][3].

The anthem was composed in 1890 in response to the British Ultimatum to Portugal regarding its African colonies[1][2][5]. This ultimatum demanded that Portugal withdraw its troops from the area between Angola and Mozambique, which was depicted in the "Pink Map" of Portuguese colonial ambitions[4].

The song was initially created as a patriotic protest march against the British demands and the Portuguese monarchy's acquiescence to them[2][5]. It quickly gained popularity and became associated with the Republican movement in Portugal[5].

Although written in 1890, "A Portuguesa" was not officially adopted as the national anthem until after the establishment of the Portuguese Republic. It became the de facto anthem in 1910 and was officially recognized as the national anthem in 1911, replacing the previous monarchical anthem "Hino da Carta"[1][2][5].

The anthem's original chorus included a line directed against the British, which was later changed. The current version, officially standardized in 1957, replaced "Against the British, march on, march on!" with "Against the cannons, march on, march on!"[6][7].
