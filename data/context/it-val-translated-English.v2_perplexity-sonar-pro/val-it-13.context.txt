The most famous confectionery factory in Toruń is the Confectionery Factory "Kopernik" (Fabryka Cukiernicza "Kopernik" in Polish). It was originally founded in 1763 by Johann Weese (also known as Jan Weese)[1][2][9].

Johann Weese (1731-1775) established the gingerbread workshop that would eventually become the Kopernik factory. He learned the trade of gingerbread baking from Melchior Friebe and, through a series of marriages and inheritances, became the owner of an existing gingerbread business[9].

The factory has a rich history spanning over 250 years:

1. Johann Weese founded the original workshop in 1763, located at what is now 5/9 Małe Garbary street in Toruń[9].

2. The business remained in the Weese family for generations. Johann's grandson, Gustav Weese, modernized the workshop into a factory in the late 19th century[1][2].

3. In 1913, a newer and larger factory was built in the suburbs of Toruń, at what is now Żółkiewskiego Street. This location continues to be the main production site for Kopernik products[1][2].

4. The factory was nationalized after World War II but was later privatized in 1991, becoming the first confectionery company in Poland to be privatized as an employee-owned company[9].

Today, the Kopernik Confectionery Factory is renowned for producing Toruńskie Pierniki (Toruń Gingerbread), a traditional Polish treat with protected geographical indication status. It is not only the oldest confectionery factory in Poland but also one of the oldest in Europe[5][9].
