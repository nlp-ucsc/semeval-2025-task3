The Irrawaddy River, also known as the Ayeyarwady River, flows through several states and regions in Myanmar (formerly Burma). Based on the provided information, the river traverses the following areas:

1. Kachin State: The Irrawaddy originates in the northern part of Myanmar, specifically in Kachin State, where the N'mai and Mali rivers converge[1][5].

2. Mandalay Region: The river flows through the Mandalay Region, passing by the city of Mandalay, which was formerly the capital of the kingdom of Myanmar[4][5].

3. Sagaing Region: After Mandalay, the river continues its course through the Sagaing Region[5].

4. Magway Region: The Irrawaddy then flows through the Magway Region, passing by cities such as Yenangyaung[4][5].

5. Bago Region: As it approaches its delta, the river passes through the Bago Region[5].

6. Ayeyarwady Region: Finally, the river enters the Ayeyarwady Region, where it forms its expansive delta before emptying into the Andaman Sea[1][5].

The Irrawaddy River is crucial to Myanmar, serving as the country's primary commercial waterway and flowing through its historical, cultural, and economic heartland[4]. Its total drainage basin covers about 61% of Myanmar's land area, making it a vital resource for a large portion of the country[5].
