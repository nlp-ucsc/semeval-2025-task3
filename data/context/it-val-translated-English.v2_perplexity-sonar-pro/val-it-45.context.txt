I apologize, but that statement is incorrect. Ghislain Konan has won an international cup with the Ivory Coast national team as of 2024.

Ghislain Konan was part of the Ivory Coast squad that won the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations[3]. This tournament, despite its name, was actually held in early 2024 due to scheduling changes. The Africa Cup of Nations is the main international football competition for national teams in Africa, making it a significant international cup victory for Konan and the Ivory Coast team.

Specifically:

1. Konan was named in the Ivory Coast squad for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations[3].
2. The Ivory Coast team went on to win this tournament[3].
3. Konan's performance in the tournament was notable, as he was selected for the Africa Cup of Nations Team of the Tournament[3].

This victory represents a major international achievement for Ghislain Konan with his national team. It's worth noting that international cups for national teams are relatively rare compared to club competitions, with continental championships like the Africa Cup of Nations being among the most prestigious for African players.
