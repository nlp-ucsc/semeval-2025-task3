According to legend, the founders of Lugdunum were Momorus and Atepomarus[5]. This mythical account of the city's founding is described in Pseudo-Plutarch's work "Of the Names of Rivers and Mountains."

The legend states that when Momorus and Atepomarus were dethroned by Seseroneus, they decided to build a city on top of a hill, following an oracle's command. As they laid the foundations, a large number of crows appeared, covering the nearby trees with their outstretched wings. Momorus, who was skilled in augury (the practice of interpreting omens), interpreted this as a sign and named the city Lugdunum[5].

The name Lugdunum is explained in the myth as a combination of two elements:
1. "Lugos," which allegedly meant "crow" in the local language
2. "Dunum," meaning "a spacious hill" or "fortress"[5]

It's important to note that while this is the legendary account, the historical founding of Lugdunum is attributed to the Roman governor Lucius Munatius Plancus in 43 BC[1][2][3]. The mythical story, however, likely represents an older Gaulish tradition that was later incorporated into the city's lore.

Some scholars interpret this founding myth as potentially representing Gaulish deities:
- Atepomarus may be associated with the god Lugus
- Momorus might represent Belinos, a deity associated with prophecy[5]

This legendary account, while not historically accurate, provides insight into the cultural and religious background of the region before Roman colonization.
