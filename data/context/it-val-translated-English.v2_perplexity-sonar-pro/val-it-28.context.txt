According to the most accredited scientific theories, there are four fundamental forces in nature:

1. Gravitational Force
2. Electromagnetic Force
3. Strong Nuclear Force
4. Weak Nuclear Force

These four forces are considered fundamental because they cannot be reduced to more basic interactions[1][2][3]. They govern all known interactions in the universe, from the smallest subatomic particles to the largest cosmic structures.

## Characteristics of the Four Fundamental Forces

1. Gravitational Force:
   - It is the weakest of the four forces but has an infinite range[2][4].
   - It is always attractive and acts between any two pieces of matter in the universe[10].
   - It is responsible for holding together large-scale structures like planets, stars, and galaxies[2].

2. Electromagnetic Force:
   - It is much stronger than gravity and also has an infinite range[2][4].
   - It is responsible for electric and magnetic fields, chemical bonding, and electromagnetic waves including visible light[2].
   - It acts between particles with electric charge.

3. Strong Nuclear Force:
   - It is the strongest of all four forces but has a very short range (about 10^-15 meters)[2][4].
   - It binds quarks together to form hadrons like protons and neutrons, and also holds protons and neutrons together in atomic nuclei[1][4].

4. Weak Nuclear Force:
   - It is stronger than gravity but weaker than the electromagnetic and strong forces[2].
   - It has a very short range (about 10^-18 meters)[2].
   - It is responsible for certain types of radioactive decay and plays a crucial role in nuclear fission[3].

These forces are described by different theories: gravity by general relativity, and the other three by the Standard Model of particle physics[2]. Physicists have been working on unifying these forces into a single theory, but a complete "theory of everything" remains elusive.

It's worth noting that some scientists hypothesize about the existence of a fifth force, but these ideas remain speculative and are not part of the currently accepted scientific framework[2][6].
