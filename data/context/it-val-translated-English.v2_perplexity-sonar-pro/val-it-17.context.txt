Several Russian kremlins exist without walls or with only partial walls remaining. These include:

1. Vladimir Kremlin: The Vladimir Kremlin retains only the Golden Gate tower and some earthen banks, but lacks complete walls[5]. It was once an important fortification but much of its original structure has been lost over time.

2. Dmitrov Kremlin: Located in Dmitrov, this kremlin no longer has intact walls surrounding it[5]. However, it still contains historical buildings and structures within its former boundaries.

3. Ryazan Kremlin: The Ryazan Kremlin exists as an unwalled complex[5]. While it lacks defensive walls, it still contains important historical and architectural elements.

4. Vologda Kremlin: This kremlin, which was originally a bishop's residence, is now unwalled[5]. It retains its historical significance despite the absence of fortifications.

5. Yaroslavl Kremlin: Only two towers remain of the original Yaroslavl Kremlin fortifications[5]. The rest of the walls have been lost over time.

6. Pereslavl-Zalessky Kremlin: This kremlin exists without walls in its current state[5].

7. Khlynov (Vyatka) Kremlin: The kremlin in Khlynov, also known as Vyatka, is now unwalled[5].

8. Volokolamsk Kremlin: This kremlin also exists without its original walls[5].

These kremlins, while lacking their original defensive walls, often still contain important historical buildings, cathedrals, or administrative structures. They serve as reminders of Russia's rich architectural and cultural heritage, even if they no longer function as fortified citadels. The absence of walls in these cases is often due to historical events, natural degradation over time, or urban development that has altered the original layout of these ancient city centers.
