The logo that appears on the start page of Windows Neptune is derived from the Windows 2000 logo. Windows Neptune was based on the Windows 2000 codebase and was in development in 1999 as a potential consumer-oriented version of Windows built on the Windows NT architecture[3][7].

Key points about the Windows Neptune logo:

1. Visual similarity: The Neptune logo closely resembled the Windows 2000 logo, featuring the four-color Windows flag design that was characteristic of Windows branding at that time[1][9].

2. Transitional period: Neptune was developed during a transitional period in Windows branding. It came after Windows 2000 but before the significant logo redesign that occurred with Windows XP[1][3].

3. Unreleased status: As Windows Neptune was never officially released, its logo remained in a developmental state. Only one alpha build (5111) was ever released to testers[3][7].

4. Branding retention: The build of Neptune that was leaked still included much of the existing Windows 2000 branding, including the logo, as it was forked from the Windows 2000 Release Candidate 2 codebase[7].

5. Historical context: This logo represents a point in Windows' visual identity evolution, bridging the gap between the classic Windows 9x/2000 era and the more modern design introduced with Windows XP[1][3].

It's worth noting that after the Neptune project was cancelled, it was merged with the Odyssey project (intended as a business-oriented successor to Windows 2000) to form the Whistler project, which eventually became Windows XP. Windows XP introduced a significant redesign of the Windows logo, moving away from the flag design used in Neptune and earlier versions[1][3].
