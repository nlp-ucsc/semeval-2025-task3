The surface area of the Ludhiana Municipal Corporation is 159.37 square kilometers (sq km)[3][10]. This figure is consistently reported across multiple sources, including official government websites and academic papers. 

Ludhiana is the largest city in Punjab in terms of both area and population[10]. The municipal corporation area accommodates approximately 1.6 million people (16 lakh) according to recent estimates[3][10]. 

It's worth noting that while the municipal corporation covers 159.37 sq km, the larger Ludhiana district has a total area of 3,767 sq km[8]. The city itself is centrally located within the Malwa region of Punjab, situated on the Grand Trunk Road between Delhi and Amritsar[8].

The city's area is divided into four administrative zones (A, B, C, and D) for municipal governance purposes[7]. Each zone has its own office to handle local issues and services.

Ludhiana's urban landscape includes both the Old City and the New City (primarily consisting of the Civil Lines area)[4]. The city is settled along the banks of the Sutlej River and is known for being an important industrial center, often referred to as "India's Manchester" due to its manufacturing prowess[4].
