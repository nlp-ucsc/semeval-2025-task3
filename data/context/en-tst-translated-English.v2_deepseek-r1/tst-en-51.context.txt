That's correct! Cornsalad, known botanically as *Valerianella locusta* and commonly referred to as lamb's lettuce, does indeed produce small, delicate flowers. These blooms are typically white or pale blue in color and grow in clusters, adding a subtle beauty to the plant. The flowering period usually occurs in the spring or early summer, making it a pleasant sight during these seasons. Cornsalad is also cultivated for its edible leaves, which are used in salads, adding a nice texture and flavor.
