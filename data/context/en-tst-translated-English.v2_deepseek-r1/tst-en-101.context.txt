"Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!" is a 1965 exploitation film directed by Russ Meyer, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Jack Moran. The film is known for its over-the-top action, campy humor, and strong female characters, particularly the trio of go-go dancers who go on a violent rampage. It has since become a cult classic and is often celebrated for its bold style and feminist undertones. Meyer's work often explored themes of female empowerment and sensuality, and "Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!" is one of his most iconic films.
