Yes, that's correct! The Emden was indeed a light cruiser built at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Danzig, which is now Gda≈Ñsk, Poland. She was one of the Dresden-class cruisers of the Imperial German Navy and was constructed between 1906 and 1909. The Emden is most famous for her role in the early days of World War I, particularly her actions in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific as a commerce raider, where she captured or sank several Allied ships and even attacked the port of Penang in British Malaya, sinking a Russian cruiser and a French destroyer. Her exploits earned her the nickname "Swan of the East." Eventually, she was intercepted and sunk by the Australian cruiser HMAS Sydney on November 9, 1914, near the Cocos Islands. The wreck of the Emden was discovered in 2012, lying at a depth of around 45 meters near North Keeling Island.
