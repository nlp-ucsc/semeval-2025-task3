This academic background played a significant role in shaping his career, as he went on to become a prominent warlord and military commander, particularly active during the Warlord Era of China in the early 20th century. His time at Baoding Military Academy was a crucial stepping stone that contributed to his rise in the military hierarchy and his influence in China's turbulent political landscape during that period.
