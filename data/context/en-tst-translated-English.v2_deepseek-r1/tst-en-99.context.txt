It seems like there might be some confusion in your statement. Fredrikstad Fotballklubb, a Norwegian football club, has indeed gone through changes regarding their home ground. However, they did not change their stadium from Fredrikstad Stadion to the new Fredrikstad Stadion in 2007. 

Fredrikstad Stadion, also known as Iddretsparken, was their home until 2007. In that year, they moved to the newly built Nye Fredrikstad Stadion. So, it's more accurate to say that they moved from Fredrikstad Stadion (the old one) to Nye Fredrikstad Stadion in 2007.
