The statement refers to a specific year in the early Roman Republic, specifically 461 BC, which was known as the "Year of the Consulship of Cornelius and Vibulanus." In the pre-Julian Roman calendar, years were typically identified by the names of the two consuls who held office during that year, rather than by a continuous count of years from a fixed starting point. This method of dating was common in the Roman Republic, where consuls were elected annually and their names served as a sort of unofficial designation for that particular year.

461 BC falls during a period of significant political and social change in Rome. It was a time when the Republic was still in its formative stages, having overthrown the monarchy just a few decades earlier in 509 BC. The period was marked by ongoing struggles between different classes, particularly the patricians and plebeians, as well as external threats from neighboring regions.

During this year, the consuls would have been responsible for the civil administration of Rome, the leadership of the military, and the oversight of religious ceremonies. The names "Cornelius" and "Vibulanus" likely refer to members of prominent patrician families, who dominated the consulship during the early Republic. Their specific activities or achievements during their term would be recorded in historical annals, although detailed records from this period are often sparse and sometimes unreliable due to the limitations of historical documentation at the time.

Understanding the context of 461 BC helps to appreciate the broader historical landscape within which this consulship took place. It was a year that, like many others in the early Republic, was shaped by internal political dynamics and external pressures, all of which contributed to the gradual development of Roman institutions and society.
