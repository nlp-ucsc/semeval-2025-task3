Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi, commonly known as HJK Helsinki, is a Finnish football club based in Helsinki. While their home kit is traditionally in blue and white stripes, their away colors can vary by season. In recent years, the away kits have been predominantly black or dark blue, but it's always a good idea to check the club's official website or the latest season's merchandise for the most accurate and up-to-date information. This ensures you have the correct details since away colors can change from one season to another.
