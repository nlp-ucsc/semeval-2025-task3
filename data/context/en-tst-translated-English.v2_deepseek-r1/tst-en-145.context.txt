It looks like there's been a mix-up here. Let me help clarify.

The video game "Max Payne 3," released in 2012, actually features a score composed by **Health**, an American noise rock band. While **Hans Zimmer** is a renowned composer known for his work on various films and games like "Inception" and "The Dark Knight" trilogy, he wasn't directly involved in the "Max Payne 3" soundtrack.

Health's gritty and intense electronic sound perfectly complemented the game's dark, gritty, and chaotic atmosphere, earning praise for its originality and impact.
