The Ukrainian karbovanets (karbovanet) was indeed the currency of Ukraine before it was replaced by the Ukrainian hryvnia. Here's a brief overview:

- **Introduction of Karbovanets**: The karbovanets was introduced in 1992, shortly after Ukraine gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. It was a temporary currency meant to facilitate economic transition and stabilize the financial system.

- **Economic Challenges**: During its use, Ukraine faced severe economic difficulties, including high inflation rates. The karbovanets suffered from rapid devaluation, making it unstable and difficult to manage.

- **Replacement by Hryvnia**: In 1996, the government decided to replace the karbovanets with the hryvnia (UAH) as part of broader economic reforms. The exchange rate was set at 100,000 karbovanets to 1 hryvnia, reflecting the significant inflation that had occurred.

- **Design and Denominations**: The hryvnia was introduced with redesigned banknotes and coins, aiming to restore confidence in the currency and the economy.

This change marked an important step in Ukraine's efforts to stabilize its economy and integrate into the global financial system.
