The crash of Air France Flight 296Q on June 26, 1988, occurred during a demonstration flight of an Airbus A320 at an air show in Habsheim, France. The aircraft faced difficulties while performing a low-altitude, slow-speed flyover when it failed to climb, resulting in a collision with trees at the end of the runway, ultimately crashing into a nearby forest. This incident claimed three lives and injured many. Key factors contributing to the accident included pilot error, unfamiliarity with the A320's advanced fly-by-wire control system, and lapses in communication between the flight crew and air traffic control. These elements highlight critical challenges in handling new aviation technology and the importance of effective communication in aviation safety.
