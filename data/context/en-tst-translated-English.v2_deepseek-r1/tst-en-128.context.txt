The Virginia Cavaliers, the athletic teams of the University of Virginia, are represented by their mascot, which is indeed referred to as the "Cavalier." However, the more specific and commonly used name for the mascot is "CavMan." CavMan is a costumed character who entertains fans at games and university events, embodying the spirit and pride of the Virginia Cavaliers. It's worth noting that the term "Cavalier" historically refers to a supporter of King Charles I in England, and the university's use of the name reflects a connection to the Commonwealth of Virginia's colonial history.
