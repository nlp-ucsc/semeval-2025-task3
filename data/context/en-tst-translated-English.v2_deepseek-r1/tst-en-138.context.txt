Right! Yves Klein, a French artist, indeed created International Klein Blue, often abbreviated as IKB. He developed this vibrant shade of blue in the 1950s in collaboration with a chemist. Klein was fascinated by the emotional and psychological impact of color, particularly monochromatic works, and IKB became one of his signature elements. IKB is not just a color but a specific pigment that Klein patented to maintain its consistency and intensity across his artworks. It's primarily used in his monochromatic paintings, which aim to evoke deep feelings and a sense of the infinite. Klein's work with IKB is considered a landmark in the development of modern and contemporary art.
