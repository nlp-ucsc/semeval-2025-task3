The Lesser Bamboo Rat (Cricetomys emini) is currently classified as "Near Threatened" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This classification suggests that while they are not endangered at present, they could become threatened with extinction in the future. The primary concerns for their potential endangerment include habitat loss and degradation, primarily due to deforestation and urban expansion, which reduce the availability of their natural habitats and food sources. Additionally, other potential threats such as hunting for bushmeat or competition with other species could exacerbate their vulnerability. Conservation efforts aimed at protecting their habitats and monitoring their populations are essential to preventing their status from being upgraded to "Vulnerable" or higher in the future.
