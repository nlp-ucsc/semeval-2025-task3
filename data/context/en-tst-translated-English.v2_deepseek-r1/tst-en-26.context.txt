Bahram I, also known as Bahram-e Dushanbeh (Bahram the Enemy of the Poor), was indeed a king of the Sasanian Empire, ruling from 271 to 274 AD. He was the son of Shapur I, one of the most celebrated emperors of the Sasanian Empire, known for his military conquests and administrative reforms. During his reign, Bahram I faced internal conflicts, particularly with the nobility, which contributed to the relative brevity of his reign. His brother, Bahram II, succeeded him and went on to rule the empire. Despite his short tenure, Bahram I's reign is notable for the challenges he faced in maintaining stability within the empire.
