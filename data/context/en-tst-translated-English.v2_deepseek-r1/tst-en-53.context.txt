That's an interesting observation! The Spotted Blue-eye (Pseudomugil gertrudae) is indeed known for its diverse diet, which typically consists of small invertebrates such as zooplankton, tiny crustaceans, and insect larvae. Additionally, they do consume algae, making them omnivorous. This dietary adaptability helps them thrive in various aquatic environments, from slow-moving streams to still waters. Their feeding habits also play a role in maintaining the ecological balance in their ecosystems by controlling the populations of small invertebrates and algae.
