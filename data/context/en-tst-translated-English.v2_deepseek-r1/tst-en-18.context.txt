That's not accurate. Magnar Solberg competed in cross-country skiing, not biathlon, at the Winter Olympics. He won two bronze medals in the 4x10 km relay at the 1948 and 1952 Winter Olympics. He didn't win any gold medals.

If you were referring to another athlete named Magnar Solberg who competes in biathlon, I don't have information on that individual.
