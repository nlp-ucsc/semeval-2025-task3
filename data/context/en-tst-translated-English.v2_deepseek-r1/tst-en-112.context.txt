The spade-toothed whale, scientifically referred to as *Mesoplodon traversii*, indeed owes its name to Henry Hammersley Travers, a notable figure in New Zealand's natural history as a naturalist and collector. It was in 1874 that John Edward Gray, a prominent British taxonomist, described and officially named this species as a tribute to Travers, acknowledging his contributions to the field of natural history. The species gains its common name from the distinctive spade-shaped teeth present in its mouth, a characteristic that differentiates it from other whales. This whale is classified under the genus *Mesoplodon*, which comprises several species of beaked whales, all known for their deep-diving abilities and elusive nature. Unfortunately, the spade-toothed whale is among the least understood whale species due to the rarity of sightings and specimens, making it one of the most enigmatic marine mammals in the world.
