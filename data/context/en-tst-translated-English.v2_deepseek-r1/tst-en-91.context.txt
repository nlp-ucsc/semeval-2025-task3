The Battle of Long Island, also known as the Battle of Brooklyn, took place on August 27, 1776, during the American Revolutionary War. The British forces were indeed commanded by General William Howe, along with his brother Admiral Richard Howe. Under General Howe's leadership, the British successfully executed a strategic maneuver that forced the Continental Army, led by General George Washington, to retreat from Brooklyn to Manhattan. This battle marked a significant British victory in the New York campaign, though Washington's eventual evacuation of his troops across the East River proved to be a crucial decision in preserving the Continental Army.
