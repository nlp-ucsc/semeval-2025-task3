Yes, the Mistletoebird (Dicaeum hirundinaceum) is indeed known to consume the fruit of Amyema quandang, which is a species of mistletoe native to Australia. This bird plays a crucial role in the dispersal of the mistletoe's seeds, contributing to the plant's life cycle. The Mistletoebird eats the fruit, and the seeds pass through its digestive system intact, often being deposited in new locations, which aids in the spread of the mistletoe. This mutualistic relationship highlights the interconnectedness of species in their ecosystems.
