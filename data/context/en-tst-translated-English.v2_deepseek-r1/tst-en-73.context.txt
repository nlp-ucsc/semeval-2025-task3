Not quite! The character you're thinking of is actually named Kevin Garvey, and he's portrayed by Justin Theroux. While Kevin does hold a position of authority, he's the Chief of Police in the fictional town of Mapleton, not the overall police chief for the entire show. The show "The Leftovers" explores themes of grief, mystery, and the supernatural after a global event causes 2% of the world's population to vanish without explanation. Justin Theroux's performance as Kevin Garvey is a central part of the series, and his character deals with both personal and communal struggles throughout the story.
