The BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role was indeed first presented in 1968. However, there was a hiatus in the presentation of this award. Specifically, the award was not given between the years 1985 and 1989. Following this period, it was reintroduced in 1990 and has been awarded consistently every year since then. This interruption in the award's presentation was part of the evolving nature of the BAFTA awards, reflecting changes in the organization's focus and structure over the years.
