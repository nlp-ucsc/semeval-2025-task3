DOT 5 brake fluid is a type of non-petroleum-based brake fluid, typically made from silicone, and is known for its high dry boiling point of approximately 260°C (500°F). This makes it suitable for high-performance applications where excessive heat can be generated. However, DOT 5 should not be mixed with other types of brake fluids, such as DOT 3 or DOT 4, and it's important to follow the manufacturer's recommendations when choosing brake fluid.
