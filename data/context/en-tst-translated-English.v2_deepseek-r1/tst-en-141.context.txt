That's correct. The Autonomous Province of Korçë, also known as the Republic of Korçë, was indeed a semi-autonomous region established in 1916 during World War I. Under French military administration, this province was created in an effort to bring order to the region that was experiencing political instability and external threats.

In the context of World War I, the Balkan region was particularly volatile. Albania, having declared independence in 1912, was struggling with internal political divisions and external pressures from neighboring countries. The establishment of the Autonomous Province of Korçë was largely driven by the French authorities to counteract these challenges.

The province was located around the city of Korçë in southeastern Albania. By granting it a degree of autonomy, the French aimed to ensure the region's stability, which was crucial for their military operations in the Balkans. The administration established local governance structures, promoted economic activities, and maintained public order, which helped in managing the region effectively during the war years.

The Autonomous Province of Korçë ceased to exist in 1920 when Albania regained full control over its territory, following the end of World War I and the subsequent redrawing of national boundaries. This period marks an important chapter in Albania's history during the early 20th century, reflecting the complex interplay of political and military factors in the Balkans at the time.
