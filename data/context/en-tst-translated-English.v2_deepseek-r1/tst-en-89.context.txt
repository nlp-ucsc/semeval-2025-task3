That's not accurate. As of my last update in July 2024, there is no record of a place named "Rosendorf" belonging to a municipal association called "RÃ¶thlein" in Germany. It's possible that you may be referring to a different location or there might be a mix-up in the names. If you have more details or need information about a specific place, feel free to share, and I'll do my best to assist you!
