As of my last data update in October 2023, Microsoft Edge is not the most popular web browser. Google Chrome holds the largest market share in the browser market. However, Microsoft Edge has gained some users, especially since it switched to the Chromium engine, which offers improved performance and compatibility. Popularity can vary based on regions and specific user needs, so it's always a good idea to check the most current statistics for the latest information.
