The Julang-2 (JL-2) is indeed a crucial component of China's nuclear deterrent. As a second-generation intercontinental-range submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), it is specifically designed for deployment aboard the Type 094 Jin-class submarines, which are nuclear-powered and serve as a key part of the People's Liberation Army Navy's strategic capabilities. The JL-2's development represents a significant advancement in China's ability to project nuclear power, allowing it to target areas across the Pacific and beyond, thereby enhancing its strategic reach and deterrence. This system underscores China's ongoing efforts to modernize its military and ensure a credible second-strike capability in the event of a nuclear conflict.
