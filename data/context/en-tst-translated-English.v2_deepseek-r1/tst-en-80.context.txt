Yes, that's correct! Chuseok, which is one of the most significant traditional holidays in South Korea, usually spans three days. It is celebrated on the 15th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar, which often falls in late September or early October in the Gregorian calendar. 

During these three days, Koreans traditionally return to their hometowns to reunite with their families, honor their ancestors, and participate in various customs. Some of the key customs include preparing and sharing traditional foods like songpyeon (half-moon-shaped rice cakes), performing ancestral rituals (charye), and playing folklore games such as yut nori (a board game) and ganggangsullae (a circle dance under the full moon). 

The three-day celebration allows families to bond, pay respects to their heritage, and enjoy the beauty of the harvest moon, which is at its fullest and brightest during this time. It's a period filled with deep cultural significance and familial warmth in South Korea.
