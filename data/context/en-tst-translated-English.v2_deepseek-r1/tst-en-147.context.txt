That's correct! The perihelion of asteroid 661 Cloelia is indeed approximately 2.49 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun. Perihelion refers to the point in an object's orbit where it is closest to the Sun. An astronomical unit is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun, so 2.49 AU means that at its closest point, 661 Cloelia is about 2.49 times farther from the Sun than Earth is on average.
