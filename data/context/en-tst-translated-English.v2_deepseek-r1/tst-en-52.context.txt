Frances Farmer was indeed first committed to a psychiatric institution in 1943. She was an American actress who struggled with mental health issues throughout her life. Farmer's career in Hollywood was promising, but her personal life was marked by challenges, including struggles with alcohol and mental health, which led to her being institutionalized multiple times. She was diagnosed with schizophrenia, although some have questioned the accuracy of this diagnosis. Her experiences in mental institutions were often traumatic, including undergoing treatments like insulin coma therapy and electroconvulsive therapy, which were common at the time but have since been widely criticized. Farmer's story has been the subject of various books, films, and documentaries, highlighting her talent, her struggles, and the harsh conditions she faced in the mental health system during that era.
