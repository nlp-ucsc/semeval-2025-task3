It seems like you're referring to a film called "Hit Man." If filming began in October 2022, I don't have real-time information or updates beyond my training data, which goes up until July 2024. However, I can suggest checking recent entertainment news sources for the latest updates on the film's release date, cast, or plot details. If you have more specific questions or need information about similar movies, feel free to ask!
