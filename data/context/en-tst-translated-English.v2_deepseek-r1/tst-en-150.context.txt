In Greek mythology, the Aloadae,Otus and Ephialtes,were twin giants known as the Aloadae, and their mother is often cited as Iphimedia, who was a sea-goddess. However, there are variations in the myths, and in some accounts, their mother is listed as Euryale, who was also a figure associated with gigantes (giants) in Greek mythology.

The Aloadae were known for their immense strength and their rebellion against the Olympian gods, often referred to as the Gigantomachy. According to myth, they posed a significant threat to the gods, even attempting to reach Mount Olympus by piling mountains atop one another. However, they were eventually defeated, with their downfall often attributed to the cunning of the gods rather than direct confrontation.

This duality in their parentage reflects the rich and sometimes conflicting narratives found within Greek mythology, where stories and genealogies could vary across different regions and traditions.
