Yes, you're correct! Ritscher Upland, located in Queen Maud Land, Antarctica, was indeed named after Alfred Ritscher, a German polar explorer and captain. He led the German Antarctic Expedition (1938-1939), which was a significant expedition during that period. The expedition aimed to explore and map parts of Antarctica and assert German territorial claims in the region. Ritscher's contributions to Antarctic exploration are still recognized today through the naming of this upland in his honor.
