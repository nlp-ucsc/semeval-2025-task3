That's correct. Mark Warner began serving as a U.S. Senator representing Virginia on January 3, 2009. Prior to that, he served as the Governor of Virginia from 2002 to 2006. His transition from governor to senator came after winning the 2008 election, where he defeated Republican candidate Jim Gilmore. As a senator, Warner has focused on issues like economic development, healthcare reform, and technology policy.
