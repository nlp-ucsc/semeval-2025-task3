That's correct! Love darts, also known as "dart shooting" or "stilts," are a fascinating mating behavior observed in certain species of hermaphroditic land snails and slugs. These projectiles, made of calcium carbonate or other materials, are typically fired during courtship rituals by members of families like Helicidae (common garden snails) and Sphincterochilidae.

In these species, the love darts are thought to play a role in increasing the chances of successful fertilization. When a snail fires a dart at its mate, it can help establish dominance or readiness for mating. However, not all land snails engage in this behavior. Many species, including those in the genus **Zonitoides**, do not use love darts and instead rely on other mating strategies. 

**Zonitoides** snails are indeed small, air-breathing land snails, often referred to as "glass snails" due to the translucent nature of their shells. They belong to the family Gastrodontidae and are found in various habitats, including moist, leaf-littered areas. These snails reproduce through a more direct approach, typically involving the exchange of sperm during mating without the use of love darts.
