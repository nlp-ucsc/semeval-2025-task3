That's correct! Paul Egede, along with his parents Hans and Gertrud Rask, was part of a missionary expedition to Greenland in the early 18th century. Their mission was to convert the indigenous Inuit people to Christianity and to establish a Danish-Norwegian presence in the region. Paul Egede's work laid the foundation for the spread of Christianity in Greenland and had a significant impact on the cultural and religious landscape of the island.
