The family of false saber-toothed cats named by Edward Drinker Cope is the Nimravidae. These animals, often referred to as "false saber-tooths," were predators that lived during the Paleocene to Miocene epochs. Despite their name, they were not closely related to the true saber-toothed cats, which belonged to the family Machairodontidae. The Nimravidae were smaller and had less specialized saber-like canines compared to their more famous counterparts. Cope's work on these fascinating creatures contributed significantly to the field of paleontology, helping us better understand the diversity of ancient feline predators.
