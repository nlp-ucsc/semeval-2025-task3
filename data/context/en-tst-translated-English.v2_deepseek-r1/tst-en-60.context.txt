That's correct! When the Canon EOS 70D was announced in July 2013, the suggested retail price for the body only was indeed $1,199. This camera was a significant upgrade to the EOS 60D, featuring improvements such as Dual Pixel CMOS AF, which provided much better autofocus performance, especially in live view and video modes. It also boasted a 20.2-megapixel APS-C sensor and built-in Wi-Fi connectivity. The EOS 70D was well-received by enthusiasts and was particularly popular for its video capabilities.
