Got it! So, in Colombia, the president can't serve more than one term. This rule came into effect after a constitutional change in 2015, which took away the option for a president to run for office again immediately after their first term. Before that, presidents could be re-elected once. Pretty interesting how they made that change to prevent any one person from holding too much power for too long.
