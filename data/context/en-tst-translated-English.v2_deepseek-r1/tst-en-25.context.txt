That's correct! The Paris Métro Line 8 was indeed opened on July 13, 1913. It was one of the earliest lines in the Paris subway system, which has since grown to become one of the most extensive and iconic metro systems in the world. Line 8 originally ran from the station Beaugrenelle (now called Charles Michels) in the southwest of Paris to the station Porte Dorée in the southeast. Over the years, it has been extended and modified to better serve the growing population and urban development of Paris. Today, it continues to be an essential part of the city's public transportation network.
