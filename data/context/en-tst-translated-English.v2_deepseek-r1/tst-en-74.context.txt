That's correct! The Royal Yacht **HMY Britannia** is permanently berthed in the port of Leith, Edinburgh, Scotland. She served as the official yacht of the British monarch from 1954 until her decommissioning in 1997. Now, she is a popular tourist attraction and museum, offering visitors a glimpse into her storied past and the history of the British Royal Family. The Britannia is a symbol of British maritime history and is well worth a visit if you're ever in Edinburgh!
