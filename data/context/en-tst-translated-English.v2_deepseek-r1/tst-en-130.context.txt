Yes, you're correct! The trans-Neptunian object (TNO) 19521 Chaos was indeed discovered on November 19, 1998. It's a cubewano, which is a type of TNO that orbits the Sun within the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune. Chaos is named after the Greek concept of the void from which the universe was born, fitting its distant and mysterious nature. It's a relatively small object, with estimates suggesting it has a diameter of around 600 kilometers. Its orbit is nearly circular, which is typical for cubewanos, and it takes about 305 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun. Studying objects like Chaos helps astronomers learn more about the formation and evolution of the outer Solar System.
