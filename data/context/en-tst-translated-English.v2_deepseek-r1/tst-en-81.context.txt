Agastache, commonly known as giant hyssop or hummingbird mint, is a genus of about 22 species of flowering plants in the mint family (Lamiaceae). These plants are native to North America, with a few species extending into East Asia. They are popular for their tall, upright growth habit and colorful, tubular flowers which are highly attractive to pollinators like hummingbirds, butterflies, and bees, hence the name "hummingbird mint."

Agastache species are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and their ability to attract wildlife. Some popular species include Agastache cana (Texas Sage), Agastache rugosa (Korean Mint), and Agastache foeniculum (Anise Hyssop), which is known for its fragrant leaves that taste like anise or licorice.

These plants generally prefer well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making them versatile additions to various garden settings. They are also drought-tolerant once established, which adds to their appeal in water-conscious landscapes.
