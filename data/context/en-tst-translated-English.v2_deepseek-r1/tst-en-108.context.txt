That's correct! The concept of pleiotropy, where a single gene influences multiple traits, was first observed by Gregor Mendel in his studies of pea plants. Though Mendel didn't coin the term, his work laid the groundwork for understanding this genetic phenomenon. The term "pleiotropy" was later introduced by Ludwig Plate in 1910, recognizing the multifaceted effects of certain genes.
