That's correct! Black Sabbath's album *"The Eternal Idol"* was indeed released on November 8, 1987. It was during a transitional period for the band, with vocalist Ray Gillen being part of the lineup during its recording, though he left before the album's release. The album has since gained a dedicated following among fans and is notable for its heavy, doom-laden riffs and dark themes.
