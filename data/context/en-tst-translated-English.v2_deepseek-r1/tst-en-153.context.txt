Garajonay National Park, situated on the Canary Island of La Gomera, is indeed named after the legendary story of Gara and Jonay. This tale is deeply rooted in the folklore of the island, reflecting themes of love, family conflict, and tragic destiny. Gara, a princess from La Gomera, and Jonay, a prince from the neighboring island of Tenerife, were said to have been deeply in love. However, their families disapproved of their relationship, likely due to inter-island rivalries or other societal pressures. Unable to be together in life, the couple chose to end their lives by leaping from the highest peak of La Gomera, which now bears the name Garajonay, symbolizing their enduring and unbroken bond beyond death. This peak is also the namesake of the entire national park, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and known for its lush, primeval laurel forests, a testament to the Canary Islands' unique natural beauty. The legend of Gara and Jonay has become an integral part of the cultural identity of La Gomera, capturing the imagination of locals and visitors alike.
