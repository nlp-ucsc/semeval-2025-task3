Your statement is partially accurate, but it requires correction. Cyrtophora moluccensis, commonly known as the tent spider, is indeed found in the Asia-Pacific region. However, it is not native to all the areas you mentioned.

* Native Range:
  - **Asia:** Countries such as China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, and Thailand.
  - **Oceania:** Native to Australia (specifically the northern and eastern regions) and parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii.

* Introduced Range:
  - It has been introduced and established in regions outside its native range, such as parts of Africa and the Americas.

Cyrtophora moluccensis is known for building impressive tent-like structures, which are actually intricate webs used for capturing prey and protecting egg sacs. These spiders are social and often form large aggregations, creating extensive networks of webs. They are generally harmless to humans and play a significant role in controlling insect populations in their ecosystems.
