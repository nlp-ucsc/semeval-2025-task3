John Christopher Willis made significant contributions to the field of botany and evolutionary biology during his career. He is particularly recognized for his support of Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection, which was a groundbreaking concept at the time. Willis not only embraced the idea but also contributed his own theories to the understanding of plant evolution. One of his notable contributions was the "Age and Area" hypothesis, which posited that the geographical distribution of plant species could be influenced by their age and the area they inhabited. 

However, as you mentioned, this hypothesis garnered some controversy and was not universally accepted within the scientific community. Despite this, Willis's work remains an important part of the historical development of evolutionary thought, especially in botany. His ideas, even when controversial, stimulated discussion and further research into the mechanisms and patterns of species distribution and evolution.
