The brown-headed crow (Corvus fuscicapillus) indeed belongs to the Corvidae family, which is a large and diverse group of birds commonly known as crows, ravens, rooks, jackdaws, jays, magpies, treepies, and nutcrackers. These birds are known for their intelligence, social behavior, and distinctive calls. The brown-headed crow is particularly noted for its dark plumage and, as its name suggests, its brown head, which contrasts with the rest of its body. This species is typically found in various habitats, including forests and woodlands, where it forages for food such as insects, fruits, and small animals.
