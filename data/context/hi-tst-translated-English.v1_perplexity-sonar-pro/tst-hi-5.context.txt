The first woman appointed in the Air Force in America was Staff Sergeant Esther McGowin Blake, who enlisted on July 8, 1948[4][6][8]. Blake has the distinction of being the "first woman in the Air Force" as she enlisted in the first minute of the first hour of the first day that regular Air Force duty was authorized for women[4].

Some key details about Esther Blake and the early days of women in the Air Force:

1. Blake had previously served in the Women's Army Corps (WAC) during World War II[4].

2. She joined the Air Force when the Women's Armed Services Integration Act was signed into law, allowing women to serve directly in the military[8].

3. Blake's motivation for joining was deeply personal - her two sons were pilots who had been shot down during World War II, and she hoped to help free a soldier from clerical work to fight, thus potentially speeding the end of the war[4].

4. The program that allowed women to join the Air Force was initially called Women in the Air Force (WAF)[8].

5. Following Blake's enlistment, the first group of WAF recruits reported to Lackland Air Force Base in Texas for basic training[8].

It's worth noting that while Blake was the first enlisted woman in the Air Force, there were other significant "firsts" for women in the Air Force around this time:

- Colonel Geraldine Pratt May became the first female Colonel in the Air Force in 1948 when she was appointed as the first director of the newly created Women in the Air Force (WAF) program[1].

- The WAF program ended in 1976 when women were accepted into the USAF on an equal basis with men[6].

These milestones marked the beginning of a gradual integration of women into various roles within the Air Force, leading to many more achievements in subsequent years.
