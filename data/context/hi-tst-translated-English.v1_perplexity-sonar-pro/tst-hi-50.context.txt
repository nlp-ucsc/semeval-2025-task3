Martina Navratilova won the women's singles title at the 1979 Wimbledon Championships[1][4]. She defeated Chris Evert Lloyd in the final with a score of 6-4, 6-4[1][4].

This victory marked Navratilova's second consecutive Wimbledon singles title and her second Grand Slam title overall[1][3]. The tournament took place from June 25 to July 7, 1979, at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, London[1].

Navratilova's win in 1979 was part of her dominant run in women's tennis during the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s. She would go on to win a total of nine Wimbledon singles titles in her career (1978, 1979, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1990), which remains a record in the Open Era[4].

The 1979 Wimbledon victory was particularly special for Navratilova as her mother, who was visiting from Czechoslovakia on a temporary visa, was present to witness her daughter's triumph[6]. This added an emotional dimension to her achievement, given Navratilova's status as an exile from her home country at the time.
