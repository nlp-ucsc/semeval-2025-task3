3. Districts (Bakhsh): While the exact number of districts is not explicitly stated in the search results, it's important to note that in Iran's administrative structure, counties are typically subdivided into districts[1].

4. Rural Districts (Dehestan): These are collections of villages within districts. The specific number for Alborz Province is not provided in the search results, but this is a common subdivision in Iranian provinces[1].

It's worth noting that Alborz is Iran's smallest province by area[2], which may contribute to it having fewer subdivisions compared to some other Iranian provinces. The province was created relatively recently, in 2010, by separating from Tehran Province[2][4].

While the exact number of each type of subdivision (especially districts and rural districts) is not explicitly stated in the search results, we can confidently say that Alborz Province has at least 6 counties and 17 cities as its main administrative divisions.
