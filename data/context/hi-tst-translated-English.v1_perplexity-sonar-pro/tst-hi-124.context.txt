The Munich Agreement was concluded on September 30, 1938[1][2][3]. This agreement was reached in Munich, Germany, between Nazi Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Fascist Italy[1]. The key details of the agreement and its conclusion are as follows:

1. Timing: The discussions began on September 29, 1938, at the Führerbau in Munich[1]. The agreement was signed in the early hours of September 30, 1938, at approximately 1:30 a.m[1][3].

2. Signatories: The agreement was signed by Adolf Hitler (Germany), Neville Chamberlain (United Kingdom), Édouard Daladier (France), and Benito Mussolini (Italy)[1][3].

3. Purpose: The primary purpose of the agreement was to allow Germany to annex the Sudetenland, a region of Czechoslovakia with a predominantly ethnic German population[1][2].

4. Terms: The agreement stipulated that German troops would complete the occupation of the Sudetenland by October 10, 1938[1][3]. It also established an international commission to decide the future of other disputed areas[3].

5. Czechoslovakia's position: Although the agreement directly affected Czechoslovakia, the country was not invited to participate in the negotiations[3]. The Czechoslovak government was informed by Britain and France that it could either resist Nazi Germany alone or submit to the prescribed annexations[1][3].

The Munich Agreement is often seen as a failed attempt at appeasing Nazi Germany and is considered a pivotal moment in the lead-up to World War II[3][5]. Despite Chamberlain's optimistic declaration of "peace for our time" upon his return to London, the agreement did not prevent further German aggression, as Hitler annexed the remainder of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 and invaded Poland in September of the same year, triggering the start of World War II[3][5].
