Wildlife parks and safari parks are other terms used to describe facilities that display wild animals in artificial natural habitats, similar to zoos but often with some key differences:

1. Safari parks: These allow visitors to drive through large enclosures where animals roam in more expansive, naturalistic settings[2]. The first safari park was Whipsnade Park in England, opened in 1931. Notable examples include the San Diego Zoo Safari Park and North Carolina Zoo[2].

2. Conservation parks: This is a newer term adopted by some zoos in the late 20th century to emphasize their focus on wildlife conservation rather than just exhibition[2].

3. Bioparks: Another modern term used by some facilities to distance themselves from traditional zoo concepts. The National Zoo in Washington D.C. first coined this term in the late 1980s[2].

4. Wildlife conservation parks: In 1993, the New York Zoological Society rebranded its zoos under this name to highlight their conservation efforts[2].

5. Animal theme parks: These combine elements of amusement parks with zoo-like exhibits. Examples include Busch Gardens Tampa Bay and Disney's Animal Kingdom[2].

6. Aquariums: While focused on aquatic life, modern aquariums often create elaborate artificial habitats mimicking natural ecosystems[3].

7. Wildlife habitats: Some zoos and aquariums create certified wildlife habitats to showcase local flora and fauna, inspiring visitors to create similar environments at home[5].

These various terms reflect evolving approaches to animal exhibition, with increasing emphasis on conservation, education, and recreating natural habitats. However, it's important to note that regardless of the name, these facilities still face ethical debates about the welfare of captive animals and their role in conservation[4][7].
