The proton is approximately 1836 times more massive than the electron[1][2][4]. This significant mass difference between these two fundamental particles plays a crucial role in atomic structure and various physical phenomena.

To provide more precise details:

1. According to the 2022 CODATA recommended values, the proton-electron mass ratio (mp/me) is 1836.152673426 with a standard uncertainty of 0.000000032[1]. This highly accurate measurement demonstrates the remarkable precision of modern physics experiments.

2. The mass of an electron is only about 1/2000 or 0.0005 times the mass of a proton[4]. This means that electrons contribute very little to the overall mass of an atom, with most of the atomic mass coming from the protons and neutrons in the nucleus.

3. Some sources round this ratio to approximately 1840[2] or 1837[6] for simplicity in calculations or explanations. However, the more precise value of about 1836 is widely accepted and used in scientific contexts.

4. This mass difference has significant implications for atomic structure and behavior:

   - It explains why electrons orbit the nucleus while protons remain in the nucleus.
   - It affects the binding energies of atoms and molecules.
   - It influences the behavior of particles in accelerators and other physics experiments.

5. Despite the large mass difference, it's important to note that protons and electrons have exactly the same magnitude of electric charge, just with opposite signs (+1 for protons, -1 for electrons)[4]. This equal but opposite charge is crucial for the electrical neutrality of atoms.

Understanding this mass ratio is fundamental to many areas of physics and chemistry, from atomic structure to particle physics and beyond.
