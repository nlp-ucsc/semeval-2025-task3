The thirteenth Vice President of India was M. Venkaiah Naidu, who served from 2017 to 2022[5][6]. Venkaiah Naidu's mother tongue is Telugu.

While the search results don't explicitly state Naidu's mother tongue, we can infer this information based on several factors:

1. Venkaiah Naidu was born in Andhra Pradesh[3], a state where Telugu is the primary language.

2. His full name is Muppavarapu Venkaiah Naidu[6], which is a Telugu name.

3. Naidu has been a strong advocate for the use of mother tongues in education and daily life. In several instances, he has emphasized the importance of speaking in one's native language:

   - He advised Indians to take pride in their native language and use it more often[2].
   - He suggested making the mother tongue the medium of instruction in schools, at least at the primary level[4].
   - Naidu has stated that "Those who forget (their mother, motherland, native place or mother tongue) cannot be called human beings"[2].

Given his background and his strong advocacy for mother tongues, it is clear that Venkaiah Naidu's mother tongue is Telugu. His promotion of native languages, particularly in the context of his own background, aligns with his personal experience as a native Telugu speaker from Andhra Pradesh.
