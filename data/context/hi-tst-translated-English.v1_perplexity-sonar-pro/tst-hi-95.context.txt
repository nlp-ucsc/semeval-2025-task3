Selena Quintanilla-Pérez, the renowned Mexican-American singer known simply as Selena, died tragically on March 31, 1995, at the age of 23. She was fatally shot by Yolanda Saldívar, the former president of her fan club and manager of her clothing boutiques[1][2].

The events leading to Selena's death unfolded as follows:

1. In early March 1995, Selena's family discovered that Saldívar had embezzled over $30,000 from Selena's fan club and boutiques[1].

2. Selena met with Saldívar at a Days Inn motel in Corpus Christi, Texas, on March 31, 1995, to retrieve financial records[1][2].

3. During this meeting, at approximately 11:48 a.m. CST, Saldívar pulled out a .38-caliber revolver and shot Selena once in the lower right shoulder as the singer attempted to leave the room[1][2].

4. The bullet severed an artery, causing severe blood loss[1][2].

5. Despite being critically wounded, Selena managed to run towards the motel's lobby, leaving a trail of blood[1].

6. She collapsed on the floor of the lobby, where she identified Saldívar as her assailant and provided the room number before losing consciousness[1][2].

7. Selena was rushed to Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital, where doctors made heroic efforts to save her life, including blood transfusions and open heart massage[1].

8. Despite these efforts, Selena was pronounced dead at 1:05 p.m. CST, about an hour after the shooting, due to blood loss and cardiac arrest[1][2].

The aftermath of Selena's death was marked by widespread mourning and tributes:

- Her funeral drew 60,000 mourners, with many traveling from outside the United States[1].
- Numerous vigils and memorials were held in her honor[1].
- Her death was front-page news in major newspapers and interrupted regular television programming[1].
- The Hispanic community was particularly affected, with fans traveling thousands of miles to visit Selena's house, boutiques, and the crime scene[1].

Yolanda Saldívar was arrested after a nearly nine-and-a-half-hour standoff with police. She was subsequently convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 30 years[1][2].

Selena's death cut short a promising career that had already seen significant achievements, including a Grammy Award for Best Mexican-American Album in 1993[6]. Her legacy continues to influence Latin music and culture to this day.
