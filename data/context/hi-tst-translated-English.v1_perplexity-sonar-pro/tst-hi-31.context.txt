The Al Batinah region of Oman was divided into two parts on October 28, 2011[1][3][7]. Specifically:

1. Al Batinah North Governorate (محافظة شمال الباطنة)
2. Al Batinah South Governorate (محافظة جنوب الباطنة)

This division was part of a larger administrative reorganization in Oman. The split was implemented to enhance administrative efficiency and improve governance in the region[2]. 

Some key points about this division:

- The center of Al Batinah North Governorate is the wilayat of Sohar[3].
- The center of Al Batinah South Governorate is the wilayat of Rustaq[4].
- Al Batinah North Governorate consists of six provinces (wilayat): Sohar, Shinas, Liwa, Saham, Al Khaburah, and Al Suwaiq[3].
- Al Batinah South Governorate also consists of six provinces (wilayat): Rustaq, Al Awabi, Nakhal, Wadi Al Ma'awil, Barka, and Al Musannah[4].

This administrative change was part of a broader restructuring of Oman's governorates, which resulted in the country being divided into eleven governorates in total[2][5].
