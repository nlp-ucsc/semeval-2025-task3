Based on the most recent data provided in the search results, the world's third least populous sovereign country is Nauru.

Nauru is a small island nation located in Micronesia in the Central Pacific. It has a population of approximately 11,680 people as of 2024[3][4]. This makes it the third smallest country by population, after Vatican City and Tuvalu.

Some key facts about Nauru:

1. Geography: Nauru is an island with a total land area of just 21 square kilometers (8 square miles)[1][2]. This makes it the world's smallest independent republic and the third-smallest country by area.

2. Economy: Historically, Nauru's economy was based on phosphate mining, but these resources have been largely depleted. The country has faced significant economic challenges in recent years[3][4].

3. Environment: Phosphate mining has severely impacted Nauru's environment, leaving about four-fifths of the island uninhabitable and uncultivable[1][2].

4. Challenges: Nauru faces several challenges due to its small size and isolation, including limited economic opportunities, vulnerability to climate change, and dependence on imports for most goods[3][4].

5. Culture: The population is predominantly of Nauruan descent, with a distinct language and cultural identity[4].

It's worth noting that population figures can vary slightly between sources and may change over time. However, across multiple recent sources, Nauru consistently ranks as the third least populous sovereign nation in the world.
