Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 did not land on March 8, 2014. The aircraft disappeared and is presumed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean[1][3]. 

The flight departed from Kuala Lumpur International Airport at 00:41 MYT on March 8, 2014, heading to Beijing[1][3]. It last communicated with air traffic control at 01:19 MYT while over the South China Sea[3]. At 01:21 MYT, the plane disappeared from air traffic control radar screens[3][4].

Military radar continued to track the aircraft as it deviated westward from its planned flight path, crossing the Malay Peninsula and Andaman Sea[3]. The last confirmed radar sighting was at 02:22 MYT, about 200 nautical miles northwest of Penang Island[3].

Satellite data analysis indicated that the flight continued for several more hours, flying south into the southern Indian Ocean[1][3]. The final satellite communication from the aircraft was received at 08:19 MYT[1][3].

On March 24, 2014, the Malaysian government announced that based on analysis of the final satellite communications, Flight 370 was presumed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean with no survivors[3]. Despite extensive search efforts, the main wreckage of the aircraft has never been found, and the precise location of the crash remains unknown[2][3].

The disappearance of MH370 remains one of the greatest mysteries in aviation history[3]. While some debris believed to be from the aircraft has been found washed up on Indian Ocean islands and the African coast, the main wreckage and flight recorders have not been located, leaving many questions unanswered about the fate of the flight[3][6].
