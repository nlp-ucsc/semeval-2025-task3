Yusra Mardini was a member of the Refugee Olympic Team at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro[1][2][3]. This was the first time in Olympic history that a Refugee Olympic Team was formed to compete in the Games[2][3].

The Refugee Olympic Team was created by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in response to the global refugee crisis[2]. It consisted of 10 athletes from various countries who had been displaced due to conflicts in their home nations[3]. Mardini, originally from Syria, was one of two swimmers selected for this team[3].

Mardini's inclusion in the Refugee Olympic Team was particularly poignant given her background. She had fled the Syrian war in 2015, making a perilous journey across the Mediterranean Sea[1][2]. During this crossing, when the motor of their overcrowded boat failed, Mardini and her sister jumped into the water and helped push the boat to safety, saving the lives of the other refugees on board[1][4].

At the Rio Olympics, Mardini competed in swimming events, including the 100-meter butterfly and 100-meter freestyle[1][3]. While she didn't advance to the semifinals, her participation as part of the Refugee Olympic Team sent a powerful message of hope and resilience to millions of displaced people around the world[2][5].
