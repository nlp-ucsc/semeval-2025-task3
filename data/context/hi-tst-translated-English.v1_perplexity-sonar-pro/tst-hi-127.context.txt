According to British nationality law, there are six distinct categories of British nationality. These categories are:

1. British citizenship
2. British Overseas Territories citizenship (BOTC)
3. British Overseas citizenship (BOC)
4. British National (Overseas) (BN(O))
5. British subject
6. British protected person[4][6][10]

These six types of British nationality reflect the UK's historical status as a colonial empire and have varying degrees of rights and privileges associated with them[6]. It's important to note that only British citizenship grants automatic right of abode in the United Kingdom[6].

The British Nationality Act 1981 played a significant role in establishing these categories. It abolished the previous status of Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC) and replaced it with three new categories: British citizenship, British Dependent Territories citizenship (later renamed British Overseas Territories citizenship), and British Overseas citizenship[7].

Each of these nationality categories has its own specific qualifications and implications:

1. British citizenship is the most comprehensive, allowing holders to live and work in the UK without immigration restrictions[3].

2. British Overseas Territories citizenship is associated with people from current British overseas territories[4].

3. British Overseas citizenship is generally held by people with connections to former British colonies who don't have close ties to the UK or its overseas territories[6].

4. British National (Overseas) status is specific to Hong Kong residents who registered for this status before the territory's transfer to China in 1997[6].

5. British subject status is held by people with connections to former British India or the Republic of Ireland, as they existed before 1949[6].

6. British protected person status is associated with individuals from areas that were controlled by the British Empire but never formally incorporated as Crown territory[6].

It's worth noting that while there are six types of British nationality, not all of them can be acquired today. Some, like British Overseas citizenship, British National (Overseas), British subject, and British protected person, are residual categories that generally cannot be newly obtained[6].
