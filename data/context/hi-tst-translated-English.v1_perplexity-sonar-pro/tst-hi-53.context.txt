The Sydney Harbour Bridge is affectionately nicknamed "The Coathanger" by Australians and Sydney residents[1][3][4][6]. This nickname stems from the bridge's distinctive arched shape, which resembles a coat hanger when viewed from certain angles[3][4].

The bridge, which opened on March 19, 1932, is a steel through arch bridge that spans Sydney Harbour, connecting the central business district (CBD) to the North Shore[4]. It's one of the world's most recognizable landmarks and a symbol of Australian ingenuity[1].

Some additional interesting facts about the Sydney Harbour Bridge include:

1. It's the world's largest (but not longest) steel arch bridge, with a height of 134 meters (440 feet) from top to water level[2][4].

2. The bridge carries multiple types of traffic, including rail, vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian[4].

3. It was designed by British firm Dorman Long and Co Ltd of Middlesbrough and took about eight years to build[2][7].

4. The bridge earned another nickname during its early days - "the Iron Lung" - because it supported the city's economy and provided work during the Great Depression[1].

5. The bridge's design was inspired by New York City's Hell Gate Bridge[3].

The Sydney Harbour Bridge, with its iconic "Coathanger" silhouette, has become an integral part of Sydney's skyline and a beloved symbol of the city and Australia as a whole.
