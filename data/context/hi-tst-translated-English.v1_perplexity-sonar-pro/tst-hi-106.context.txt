Based on the available search results, the countries and states in Asia with the highest tractor density are:

1. India: Within India, the states with the highest tractor density are:

   - Haryana: This state has the highest tractor density in India, with 96 tractors per thousand hectares of net cropped area[7].
   
   - Punjab: Following closely behind Haryana, Punjab has 79 tractors per thousand hectares[7].

2. Thailand: While specific density figures are not provided, Thailand is mentioned as having the largest agricultural tractors market share in Southeast Asia as of 2022[1][3]. This suggests a high tractor density relative to other Southeast Asian countries.

It's important to note that tractor density can vary significantly even within countries. For example, in India, there is a stark contrast between states like Haryana and Punjab, which have very high tractor densities, and other states with much lower densities[2][6].

The data for other Asian countries is not as detailed in the provided search results. However, it's worth mentioning that countries like Japan and China also have significant numbers of agricultural tractors[4], though their densities per hectare are not specified in the given information.

To provide a more comprehensive answer, additional data on tractor densities in other Asian countries would be needed. The available information primarily focuses on India and Southeast Asia, with India's Haryana state having the highest reported tractor density among the data provided.
