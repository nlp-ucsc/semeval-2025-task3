In Arabic, the term "Excellency" (فخامة - fakhaama) is commonly used to address high-ranking officials and diplomats in international diplomacy instead of "honorable." This form of address is widely used for various important political positions[1][3]:

1. Heads of State: Presidents and monarchs are typically addressed as "His/Her Excellency" (فخامة الرئيس - fakhamat al-ra'ees for presidents, or صاحب الجلالة - sahib al-jalaala for kings)[3].

2. Ambassadors: Ambassadors and high commissioners are addressed as "His/Her Excellency" (سعادة السفير - sa'aadat al-safeer)[1][3].

3. Ministers: Government ministers are often referred to as "His/Her Excellency" (معالي الوزير - ma'aali al-wazeer)[4].

4. Governors: In some Arab countries, governors are addressed as "His Excellency" (سعادة المحافظ - sa'aadat al-muhaafiz)[3].

5. International Organizations: Representatives to international organizations like the UN are also addressed as "His/Her Excellency"[1][3].

In addition to "Excellency," other formal titles used in Arabic diplomatic and political contexts include:

- سعادة (sa'aada) - "Honorable," used for lower-ranking officials or diplomats[2].
- معالي (ma'aali) - "Excellency," often used for ministers and high-ranking officials[4].
- سمو (sumuw) - "Highness," used for royalty below the rank of king or queen[3].

It's important to note that the exact usage may vary slightly between different Arab countries, but "Excellency" (فخامة - fakhaama) remains the most common formal address for high-ranking officials in international diplomacy across the Arab world[1][3][4].
