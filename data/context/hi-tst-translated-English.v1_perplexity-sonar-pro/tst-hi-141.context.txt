The locals in Romania knew vampires by several names, each with slightly different connotations:

1. Strigoi: This is one of the most common terms for vampires in Romanian folklore[2][4][7]. The word "strigoi" comes from the Romanian word "striga," meaning "to scream"[2]. Strigoi could be either living (strigoi viu) or dead (strigoi mort)[4][7].

2. Moroi: This term is derived from the Romanian word "mort" meaning "dead" or the Slavic word for "nightmare"[4]. It's often used interchangeably with strigoi[1][10].

3. Pricolici: This refers to a type of vampire with werewolf-like attributes[4]. The term is also seen as "Priculics"[1].

4. Nosferatu: While this term is often associated with Romanian vampires in popular culture, it's actually not a Romanian word. It's believed to be an old Slavonic term meaning "plague carrier"[1].

5. Varcolac: Another term for vampire, sometimes associated with werewolf-like creatures[1][10].

6. Vârcolaci: A variant spelling of Varcolac[1].

7. Vampir: The Romanian word for vampire, though this is a more modern term[1].

8. Strigoiu: Another spelling variant of Strigoi[1].

9. Moroii: Plural form of Moroi[10].

10. Cel-rău: A polite term used to indicate vampires and other evil beings, to avoid drawing their attention[1].

It's important to note that these terms often had overlapping meanings and could refer to various types of supernatural beings, not just blood-drinking undead. The concept of vampires in Romanian folklore is complex and varied, with different regions and time periods having their own specific beliefs and terminologies[3][4][6].
