In North American tradition, Santa Claus has been assigned specific postal codes to facilitate children sending letters to him. The most widely recognized postal codes for Santa's residence are:

1. In Canada: H0H 0H0

This is the official postal code assigned by Canada Post for Santa Claus at the North Pole[1][2][3]. The Canadian government has formally awarded Santa Claus citizenship and given him this unique postal code[2]. The H0H 0H0 code is a playful reference to Santa's famous "Ho Ho Ho" laugh, though it actually uses zeros, not the letter O[3].

Key points about Canada's Santa mail program:

- It has been officially established since 1982[1].
- Over one million letters are sent to Santa each year through this program[1].
- Letters are answered in over 30 languages, including Braille[1].
- No postage is required for Canadian children sending letters to Santa[4].
- The full address used is: Santa Claus, North Pole, H0H 0H0, Canada[1][4].

2. In the United States: 88888

The United States Postal Service (USPS) uses a different system. Their Operation Santa program instructs children to address letters to:

SANTA CLAUS, 123 ELF ROAD, NORTH POLE 88888[7]

This ZIP code (88888) is a special code designated for Santa letters in the US postal system.

It's worth noting that while these are the official codes used by postal services, local traditions may vary. For instance, some communities in the US and Canada have their own Santa letter-writing programs with different addresses.

Both the Canadian and US programs aim to spread joy during the holiday season, encourage literacy, and maintain the magic of Christmas for children. They rely on volunteers to help respond to the large volume of letters received each year[1][7].
