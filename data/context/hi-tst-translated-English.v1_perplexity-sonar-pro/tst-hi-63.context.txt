The coordinates of KV10, the tomb of Amenmesse, are 25°44'23"N 32°36'4"E[6].

KV10 is located in the main wadi (valley) of the Valley of the Kings on the west bank of the Nile, near modern-day Luxor, Egypt[1][2]. It is situated in the central part of the valley, between KV11 (tomb of Ramesses III) and KV9 (tomb of Ramesses V/VI)[2].

The tomb consists of an open entryway followed by three corridors, with a small chamber off the right wall of the first corridor. It has a pillared chamber and an unfinished burial chamber[1][7]. Interestingly, during the excavation of KV11, workers accidentally broke through the ceiling of a side chamber in KV10, creating an unintended connection between the two tombs[1].

KV10 was originally constructed for Pharaoh Amenmesse of the 19th Dynasty, who ruled for a short period around 1200 BCE. However, there's no proof that he was actually buried there. Later, the tomb's decoration was replaced with scenes for two royal women from the late 20th Dynasty - Takhat and Baketwernel[2][8].
