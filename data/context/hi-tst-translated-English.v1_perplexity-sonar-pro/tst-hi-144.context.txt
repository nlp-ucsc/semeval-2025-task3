The University of Cambridge was founded in 1209[1][2][3][4]. This makes it the fourth-oldest surviving university in the world and the second-oldest university in the English-speaking world[7][8].

The founding of Cambridge University is closely tied to events at Oxford University. In 1209, following disputes between scholars and local townspeople in Oxford, some academics fled to Cambridge[1][2]. These scholars began to form the nucleus of the new university in Cambridge.

While 1209 is generally accepted as the founding year, it's worth noting that the university's official recognition and development occurred gradually over the following decades:

1. In 1231, King Henry III granted the university certain rights and privileges[1][6].

2. In 1233, Pope Gregory IX issued a letter that gave graduates from Cambridge the right to teach anywhere in Christendom[3].

3. In 1290, Pope Nicholas IV officially recognized Cambridge as a studium generale, a term used for universities in medieval times[1][3].

4. The first college of the university, Peterhouse, was founded in 1284 by Hugh de Balsham, Bishop of Ely[1][4].

It's important to note that there were some alternative theories about the university's origins in earlier centuries. For example, in the 16th century, John Caius proposed that the university was founded around 375 BC by a Spanish prince named Cantaber[5]. However, these theories have been discredited by modern historians.

The University of Cambridge has since grown into one of the world's most prestigious institutions, with a rich history spanning over eight centuries of academic excellence and groundbreaking research[4].
