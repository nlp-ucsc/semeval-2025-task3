The oldest written original Swahili letters are preserved in the Historical Archives of Goa, India[9]. These letters date back to 1711 and were written in Kilwa, Tanzania, using the Arabic script[9]. They were sent from Kilwa to the Portuguese in Mozambique and their local allies[9].

This preservation in Goa is significant for several reasons:

1. Historical context: Goa was a major Portuguese colonial outpost in India, serving as the capital of Portuguese India for several centuries. The presence of these letters in Goa reflects the complex network of colonial relationships and communications across the Indian Ocean region.

2. Linguistic importance: These letters represent some of the earliest known written examples of the Swahili language, providing valuable insights into its development and use in the early 18th century.

3. Script usage: The fact that these letters were written in Arabic script demonstrates the strong influence of Arab culture and Islam on the Swahili coast during this period, before the later shift to Latin script under European colonial influence[7].

4. Cultural exchange: The preservation of these Swahili letters in an Indian archive highlights the extensive cultural and commercial exchanges that occurred across the Indian Ocean, connecting East Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Indian subcontinent.

It's worth noting that while these 1711 letters are the oldest known original Swahili documents, the Swahili written tradition likely extends further back. Scholars believe that written Swahili literature may have existed earlier, possibly dating back to the 17th century or even earlier[5]. However, the Goa letters remain the earliest confirmed and preserved original Swahili written documents.
