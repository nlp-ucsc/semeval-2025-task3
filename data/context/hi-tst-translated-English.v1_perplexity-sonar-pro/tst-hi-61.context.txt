Salafi Sunnis do not consider any single individual as their Imam in the same way that some other Islamic groups do. Instead, Salafis aim to follow the practices and beliefs of the earliest generations of Muslims, known as the Salaf, rather than adhering to a specific contemporary leader or imam[1][2].

The Salafi movement emphasizes direct interpretation of the Quran and Hadith, rejecting later scholarly interpretations and schools of jurisprudence (madhabs) that developed over time[8]. They seek to emulate the practices of the Prophet Muhammad and his companions as closely as possible.

While Salafis don't have a single imam, they do respect and frequently reference certain scholars:

1. Ibn Taymiyyah (1263-1328): Considered one of the most influential classical scholars for Salafi theology[8].

2. Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab (1703-1792): Founder of the Wahhabi movement, which shares many similarities with Salafism[10].

3. Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani (1914-1999): A more contemporary figure often referred to as the "spiritual father" of the modern Salafi movement[8].

4. Other respected scholars include Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, Ibn Kathir, and Al-Dhahabi[8].

It's important to note that Salafis emphasize following the evidence from the Quran and Hadith rather than blindly following any particular scholar. They encourage Muslims to verify religious rulings through direct reference to these primary sources[6][8].

In summary, while Salafis respect and learn from various scholars, they do not consider any single contemporary individual as their imam. Instead, they strive to follow the example of the Salaf - the earliest generations of Muslims - as closely as possible.
