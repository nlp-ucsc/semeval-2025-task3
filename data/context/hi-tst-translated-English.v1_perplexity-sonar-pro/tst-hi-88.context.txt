The third lowest place on Earth is the Turpan Depression in China, with an elevation of approximately 154 meters (505 feet) below sea level[1][2][3].

The Turpan Depression, also known as the Turfan Depression or Turpan Basin, is located in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of western China[2]. It's a vast, below-sea-level area characterized by extreme climate conditions:

1. Climate: The region is known for being one of the hottest and driest areas in China, often referred to as one of the "Furnaces of China"[2].

2. Geography: The depression is surrounded by some of the tallest mountains on Earth, notably the Tian Shan and Bogda Shan ranges[3].

3. Historical significance: The area has a rich history, as it was part of the ancient Silk Road trade route. Archaeological sites in the region include:
   - The Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves
   - The Gaochang Ruins
   - The Astana-Karakhoja ancient tombs[3]

4. Lowest point: The lowest part of the Turpan Depression is occupied by Aydingkol Lake[2].

5. Evaporation: The potential for evaporation in this area far exceeds the amount of annual precipitation, contributing to its extremely dry conditions[2].

It's worth noting that the exact rankings of the world's lowest points can sometimes vary slightly due to fluctuations in water levels and different measurement techniques. However, most sources consistently rank the Turpan Depression as the third lowest point on Earth, after the Dead Sea Depression and Lake Assal in Djibouti[1][2][3].
