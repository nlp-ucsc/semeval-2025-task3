Uttar Pradesh, the largest state in India, has a total of 75 districts[1][2][3][4]. This administrative structure makes Uttar Pradesh the state with the highest number of districts in India[1]. The districts are organized into 18 administrative divisions for more efficient governance[2][4].

Some key points about the districts of Uttar Pradesh:

1. The 75th district of Uttar Pradesh is Ayodhya, which was officially renamed from Faizabad in November 2018[3].

2. Each district is governed by a District Magistrate from the Indian Administrative Service[1].

3. The districts vary in size and population. For example, Shamli is the smallest district, while Sonbhadra is the largest[3].

4. Some of the most populous districts in Uttar Pradesh include Prayagraj (formerly Allahabad), Moradabad, Ghaziabad, Azamgarh, Lucknow, and Kanpur Nagar[4].

5. The state's administrative structure also includes 822 blocks, 52,021 panchayats, and 107,452 villages[10].

This extensive administrative division allows for more localized governance and development efforts across the vast and populous state of Uttar Pradesh.
