Alpha Ophiuchi, also known as Rasalhague, is approximately 25 times more luminous than the Sun[1][2][3][4]. 

Specifically:

1. The primary component of the Alpha Ophiuchi binary system, Alpha Ophiuchi A (Rasalhague), is the source of this luminosity.

2. Different sources provide slightly varying estimates, but they all fall within a narrow range:
   - Some sources state it is 25.1 to 25.6 times more luminous than the Sun[3].
   - Others simply round it to about 25 times the Sun's luminosity[1][4].

3. This high luminosity is due to several factors:
   - Rasalhague is larger than the Sun, with a radius about 2.6 times that of the Sun[3].
   - It's also hotter, with an effective temperature between 7,880 and 8,050 K, compared to the Sun's approximately 5,800 K[3].
   - It's more massive, with about 2.4 times the mass of the Sun[1][2][3].

4. Interestingly, Rasalhague is a rapidly rotating star, spinning at about 88.5% of the rate that would cause it to break up[1]. This rapid rotation affects its shape and temperature distribution, which in turn influences its observed luminosity.

It's worth noting that the secondary component of the system, Alpha Ophiuchi B, is less luminous than the Sun and doesn't contribute significantly to the system's overall brightness[2].
