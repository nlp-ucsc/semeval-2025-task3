Two ellipses are similar if they have the same eccentricity[1]. The eccentricity of an ellipse is a measure of how much it deviates from a circular shape, and it is determined by the ratio of the distance between the foci to the length of the major axis.

To understand this condition more precisely:

1. Eccentricity: The eccentricity (e) of an ellipse is defined as:

   \[e = \frac{c}{a}\]

   where c is the distance from the center to a focus, and a is the length of the semi-major axis.

2. Similarity condition: For two ellipses to be similar, their eccentricities must be equal. This means that the ratio of c to a must be the same for both ellipses, regardless of their actual sizes.

3. Geometric interpretation: Similar ellipses have the same "shape" but may differ in size. They can be transformed into each other through uniform scaling (enlarging or reducing) and potentially rotation or reflection.

4. Mathematical representation: If we consider two ellipses with standard equations:

   \[\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\] and \[\frac{x^2}{a'^2} + \frac{y^2}{b'^2} = 1\]

   They are similar if and only if:

   \[\frac{b}{a} = \frac{b'}{a'}\]

   This ratio is related to the eccentricity by the equation:

   \[\frac{b}{a} = \sqrt{1 - e^2}\]

5. Preservation of properties: In similar ellipses, the ratio of the minor axis to the major axis remains constant. This means that all proportions within the ellipses are preserved.

It's important to note that while all circles are similar to each other (as they all have an eccentricity of 0), not all ellipses are similar. The similarity of ellipses depends on this specific condition of equal eccentricity, which ensures that they have the same relative "squishedness" or deviation from circularity.
