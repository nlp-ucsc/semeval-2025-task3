The Ramayana, one of the great Sanskrit epics of ancient India, consists of 500 chapters or 'sargas'[1][3]. These chapters are organized into seven books or 'kandas'[3][4].

The epic poem contains approximately 24,000 verses in total[1][3]. These verses are distributed across the seven kandas, each focusing on a different phase of Rama's life and journey:

1. Bala Kanda (Book of Youth)
2. Ayodhya Kanda (Book of Ayodhya)
3. Aranya Kanda (Book of the Forest)
4. Kishkindha Kanda (Book of the Monkey Kingdom)
5. Sundara Kanda (Book of Beauty)
6. Yuddha Kanda (Book of War)
7. Uttara Kanda (Book of the Aftermath)

Each of these kandas narrates a specific part of the epic, from Rama's birth and early life to his exile, the search for Sita, the great battle with Ravana, and the events following Rama's return to Ayodhya[3][4].

It's worth noting that the Uttara Kanda, which serves as an epilogue, is considered by some scholars to be a later addition to the original text[5]. The core narrative of Rama's story is contained within the first six kandas.

The Ramayana's structure of 500 chapters divided into seven books has made it one of the longest ancient epics in world literature[5]. This extensive narrative allows for a detailed exploration of the characters, events, and philosophical themes that have made the Ramayana a cornerstone of Hindu literature and culture for millennia.
