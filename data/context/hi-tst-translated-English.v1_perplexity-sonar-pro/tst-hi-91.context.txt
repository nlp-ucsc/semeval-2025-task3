The first edition of the New York Daily Times newspaper was published on September 18, 1851[1][2][5][7]. 

The newspaper was founded by Henry Jarvis Raymond and George Jones, who were journalists working for the New-York Tribune at the time[1]. They established Raymond, Jones & Company on August 5, 1851, and published the first issue of the New-York Daily Times about six weeks later[1].

Some key details about the newspaper's early days:

1. The original name was "New-York Daily Times"[1][7].

2. It was priced at one penny per issue (equivalent to about $0.31 in today's currency)[2].

3. The paper was initially published six days a week, with both morning and evening editions[5].

4. Its first office was located at 113 Nassau Street near City Hall Park in New York City[5].

5. The founders set out to create a conservative-leaning newspaper that focused on objective reporting for intellectual readers, rather than sensationalist "yellow journalism"[6].

6. In 1857, about six years after its founding, the paper shortened its name to "The New-York Times"[1][4].

7. Sunday editions of the newspaper began in 1861[4].

The New-York Daily Times quickly gained popularity, boasting a circulation of 10,000 copies by its ninth issue[1]. Over the years, it has grown to become one of the most influential newspapers in the United States and the world, known today simply as The New York Times.
