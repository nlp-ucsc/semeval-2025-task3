The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) was established on December 30, 1964[1][2]. It was created as a permanent intergovernmental body under the United Nations General Assembly in response to growing concerns about the place of developing countries in international trade[3].

The establishment of UNCTAD was the result of a process that began in the early 1960s. Developing countries called for a conference specifically devoted to addressing problems related to their participation in international trade and identifying appropriate international actions[3]. This led to the first United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, which was held in Geneva in 1964[3].

Key points about UNCTAD's establishment:

1. Purpose: UNCTAD was created to promote and encourage international trade and economic development in developing countries[1].

2. Founding context: It emerged in the post-World War II era, with the movement towards such a trade body culminating in the Conference on Problems of Developing Countries held in Cairo in 1962[1].

3. Initial support: Eastern European countries quickly supported the call for the conference, while economically developed countries were initially reluctant[1].

4. First Secretary-General: The prominent Argentinian economist Ra√∫l Prebisch became UNCTAD's first Secretary-General[3].

5. Institutionalization: Given the magnitude of the problems at stake, the conference was institutionalized to meet every four years, with intergovernmental bodies meeting between sessions and a permanent secretariat providing support[3].

UNCTAD's establishment marked a significant milestone in international efforts to address trade and development issues, particularly from the perspective of developing countries. It has since played a crucial role in promoting development-friendly integration of developing countries into the world economy[7].
