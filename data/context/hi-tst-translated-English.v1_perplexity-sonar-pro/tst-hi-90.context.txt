The Middle East Quartet was established in 2002[1][2][3]. It was formed in response to the outbreak of the Second Intifada, which began in September 2000, and the collapse of peace negotiations that followed[2][8].

The Quartet consists of four key international actors: the United Nations, the United States, the European Union, and Russia[2][3]. Its primary purpose was to help mediate the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and support Palestinian economic development and institution-building[4][6].

The initiative to establish the Quartet emerged after several unsuccessful attempts at implementing a ceasefire during the Second Intifada. On October 25, 2001, representatives from the four entities met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, endorsing his approach towards implementing a ceasefire and security reforms within the Palestinian Authority[2].

In April 2002, the same four entities convened in Madrid, reiterating their call for the implementation of previously brokered cease-fire agreements. It was at this meeting that they agreed to transform their cooperation into a permanent forum dedicated to overseeing the Israeli-Palestinian peace process[2]. This formalization in Madrid is why the group is sometimes referred to as the "Madrid Quartet"[2].

The Quartet's formation was welcomed by the United Nations Security Council in resolution 1397 (2002)[5]. Since its establishment, the Quartet has been involved in various peace initiatives, including the development of the "Road Map for Peace" in 2003, which outlined a performance-based strategy to move towards a final resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict[5].
