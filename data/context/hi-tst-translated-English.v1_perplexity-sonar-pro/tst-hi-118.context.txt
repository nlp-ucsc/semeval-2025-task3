The Kunar River, also known as the Chitral River in Pakistan, is approximately 480 kilometers (300 miles) long[1][7][10]. This river flows through eastern Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan, originating in the Hindu Kush mountains[1][7].

The river's journey begins in the far north glaciated Hindu Kush mountains of Chitral, Pakistan, where it is initially referred to as the Chitral River[1]. As it flows downstream, it goes through several name changes:

1. In the upper reaches, it's called the Mastuj River until its confluence with the Lotkoh River[1].
2. It then turns southward into Afghanistan, where it becomes known as the Kunar River[1][7].
3. The river continues its course through Afghanistan, eventually merging with the Kabul River near the city of Jalalabad[1][3].

The Kunar River system is primarily fed by melting glaciers and snow from the Hindu Kush mountains[1][7]. It serves as a major tributary of the Kabul River, which in turn is a tributary of the Indus River system in Pakistan[1][3].

This river is not only significant for its length but also for its potential impact on the region:

1. It has considerable untapped hydropower potential[10].
2. The river is a crucial water source for both Afghanistan and Pakistan, with about 80% of its course in Afghanistan and 20% in Pakistan[2].
3. It supports irrigation for agriculture in both countries[4].

The Kunar River plays a vital role in the geography, ecology, and economy of the regions it flows through, making it an important natural resource for both Afghanistan and Pakistan.
