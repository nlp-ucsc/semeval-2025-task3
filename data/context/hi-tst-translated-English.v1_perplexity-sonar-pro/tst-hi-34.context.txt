Asma al-Assad is fluent in both Arabic and English[1][5].

Arabic is her native language, as she was born to Syrian parents and spoke Arabic at home while growing up[5]. Her family maintained their Syrian cultural ties despite living in London.

English is her second language, which she speaks fluently. She was born and raised in London, England, and received her entire education in English-speaking institutions[1][5]. She attended Queen's College and King's College London for her studies, where the primary language of instruction was English. Her proficiency in English allowed her to work as an investment banker at Deutsche Bank and J.P. Morgan in London before her marriage[1].

Some sources mention that she studied French literature as part of her degree at King's College London[1], which suggests she may have some knowledge of French as well. However, her level of fluency in French is not explicitly stated in the provided search results.

It's worth noting that Asma al-Assad's bilingual abilities in Arabic and English were likely valuable in her role as First Lady of Syria, allowing her to communicate effectively both within Syria and in international settings.
