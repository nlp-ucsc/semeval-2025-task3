The first version of Microsoft Edge was released approximately 9 years ago.

Microsoft Edge was initially released on July 29, 2015, as part of the Windows 10 operating system[4]. This original version, now referred to as Microsoft Edge Legacy, was built using Microsoft's proprietary EdgeHTML and Chakra engines[1][4].

However, it's important to note that Microsoft later made a significant change to Edge:

1. In December 2018, Microsoft announced plans to rebuild Edge as a Chromium-based browser[1][6].

2. The first preview builds of this new Chromium-based Edge were released to the public on April 8, 2019[1].

3. The stable release of the new Chromium-based Microsoft Edge was officially launched on January 15, 2020[2][5][7].

This new version of Edge, based on the Chromium open-source project, is considered a major overhaul and is sometimes referred to as "The New Microsoft Edge" or "New Edge"[1]. It replaced the original EdgeHTML-based Edge and has become Microsoft's primary web browser offering since then.

So while the original Edge debuted in 2015, the current version of Microsoft Edge that most users are familiar with today was released in its stable form in January 2020, about 5 years ago.
