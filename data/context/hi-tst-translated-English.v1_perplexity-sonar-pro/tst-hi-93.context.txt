The Amazon rainforest extends across 9 countries in South America[1][2][5][7][8]. These countries are:

1. Brazil
2. Peru 
3. Colombia
4. Bolivia
5. Ecuador
6. Venezuela
7. Guyana
8. Suriname
9. French Guiana (an overseas territory of France)

Brazil contains the largest portion of the Amazon, covering approximately 60-64% of the total rainforest area[5][7]. The remaining portions are distributed among the other countries, with Peru having the second-largest share at around 10-13%[1][5].

Here's a brief breakdown of the approximate percentage of the Amazon rainforest in each country:

- Brazil: 60-64%
- Peru: 10-13%
- Colombia: 6-10%
- Bolivia: 6-7.7%
- Venezuela: 6%
- Guyana: 3%
- Suriname: 2-2.5%
- Ecuador: 1-2%
- French Guiana: 1-1.4%

It's important to note that these percentages may vary slightly depending on the source and the specific definition of the Amazon rainforest boundaries. Nonetheless, all sources consistently mention these nine countries as part of the Amazon ecosystem[1][2][5][7][8].
