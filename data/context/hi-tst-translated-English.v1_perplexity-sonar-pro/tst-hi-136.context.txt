The Roman Empire declared Christianity as its official state religion in 380 CE[1][3][5]. This occurred when Emperor Theodosius I issued the Edict of Thessalonica, also known as Cunctos populos, on February 27, 380 CE[1][3][5].

The Edict of Thessalonica made Nicene Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire[1]. This edict was signed by Theodosius I, the Eastern Roman Emperor, in the presence of Valentinian II, the Western Roman Emperor[5]. The decree not only established Christianity as the state religion but also allowed for the persecution of non-believers and those who practiced pagan rituals[5].

This event marked a significant turning point in the history of Christianity and the Roman Empire:

1. It solidified the influence of Christianity on the Roman world and subsequent world history[3].
2. It bound Jewish-Christian roots to those of Greek and Roman antiquity, creating a symbiosis that continues to influence European culture[5].
3. The edict effectively ended the persecution of Christians and instead allowed for the persecution of non-Christians[5].

It's important to note that this declaration was the culmination of a gradual process of Christianization within the Roman Empire:

- In 313 CE, Constantine issued the Edict of Milan, which granted legal status to Christianity and other religions[4].
- In 325 CE, Constantine convened the Council of Nicaea, which established orthodox Christian beliefs[4].
- By 350 CE, Christians represented approximately 56.5% of the empire's population[1].

The declaration of Christianity as the state religion in 380 CE thus represented the formal recognition and institutionalization of a faith that had already become dominant within the empire.
