Based on the information provided in the search results, I cannot determine the exact age of the twelfth Chief Minister of West Bengal. However, I can provide some relevant details about the Chief Ministers of West Bengal that may be helpful:

The twelfth Chief Minister of West Bengal was Jyoti Basu. He served as Chief Minister for an exceptionally long period, from June 21, 1977 to November 6, 2000[1][10]. This tenure of 23 years and 137 days made him the longest-serving Chief Minister of West Bengal[1][10].

While the search results do not provide Jyoti Basu's age during his time as the twelfth Chief Minister, they do offer some additional context:

1. Jyoti Basu served five consecutive terms as Chief Minister[1].

2. His tenure as Chief Minister began with the 8th West Bengal Legislative Assembly in 1977 and continued through the 9th, 10th, 11th, and part of the 12th assemblies[10].

3. Jyoti Basu passed away on January 17, 2010[1], several years after leaving office.

4. He held the record for the longest-serving chief minister in India until 2018, when he was surpassed by Sikkim's Pawan Kumar Chamling[10].

To determine Jyoti Basu's exact age during his time as the twelfth Chief Minister, we would need additional information about his birth date, which is not provided in the given search results. If you need his precise age, I would recommend searching for Jyoti Basu's biographical information, particularly his date of birth, to calculate his age during his tenure as Chief Minister.
