Baseball, as we know it today, was first played in the United States in the mid-19th century. However, the origins of the game are more complex and can be traced back to earlier bat-and-ball games played in various countries.

The modern form of baseball evolved in the United States, with several key developments:

1. Early roots: Baseball's ancestors include English games like rounders, stoolball, and cricket, which were brought to North America by British colonists[2][4].

2. First recorded game: The first recorded game of baseball under codified rules was played in New York on September 23, 1845, between the New York Baseball Club and the Knickerbocker Baseball Club[4].

3. Knickerbocker Rules: In 1845, the Knickerbocker Base Ball Club of New York, led by Alexander Cartwright, established the "Knickerbocker Rules," which formalized many aspects of the modern game[2][5].

4. Spread across America: The game quickly gained popularity in the United States, especially during and after the Civil War, as soldiers from different regions played and shared various versions of the game[2].

While the United States is credited with developing modern baseball, it's worth noting that similar games were played in other countries:

- Canada: There are claims of a baseball-like game being played in Beachville, Ontario, in 1838, although the exact rules are unclear[4].
- England: Early forms of bat-and-ball games, including one called "base ball," were played in England in the 18th century[3][4].
- Cuba: Baseball was introduced to Cuba in 1878 and quickly spread throughout the Caribbean[3].

In conclusion, while baseball has roots in various bat-and-ball games from different countries, the modern form of baseball as we know it today was first played and codified in the United States in the mid-19th century.
