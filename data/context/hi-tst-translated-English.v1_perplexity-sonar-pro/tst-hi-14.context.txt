FNAC stands for Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology. It is a minimally invasive diagnostic procedure used to examine small or unclear lumps in various parts of the body[1][2]. 

Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology involves using a thin, hollow needle to extract a small sample of cells from a suspicious lump, mass, or abnormal tissue[2]. The procedure is typically quick, cost-effective, and simple, causing minimal discomfort to the patient[1].

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the FNAC procedure:

1. Preparation: The skin over the area to be examined is cleaned with an antiseptic solution. Local anesthesia may be applied to minimize discomfort[2][4].

2. Aspiration: A fine needle attached to a syringe is inserted into the lump or tissue of interest. The healthcare professional moves the needle back and forth while applying suction to extract cells or fluid[2].

3. Guidance: For deeper or less accessible areas, imaging techniques like ultrasound or CT scans may be used to guide the needle accurately[2][4].

4. Sample collection: Multiple samples may be taken to ensure adequate cell collection. The extracted material is then placed on glass slides for examination[2].

5. Analysis: The samples are sent to a laboratory where they are stained and examined under a microscope by a pathologist to determine if the cells are benign, malignant, or indicative of other conditions[2][4].

FNAC is widely used for various purposes, including:

- Evaluating breast lumps for potential cancer[1][2]
- Examining thyroid nodules[2]
- Assessing lymph node abnormalities[1][2]
- Investigating salivary gland masses[1]
- Diagnosing various types of cancer and other conditions[4]

The results of an FNAC test typically fall into one of three categories: benign (non-cancerous), malignant (cancerous), or indeterminate (unclear results that may require further testing)[2]. These results help guide further medical decisions and treatments.

FNAC is valued for its ability to provide crucial diagnostic information while minimizing patient discomfort and avoiding more invasive procedures in many cases[2].
