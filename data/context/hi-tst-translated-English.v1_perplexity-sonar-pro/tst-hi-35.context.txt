The length of Earth's coastline is not a straightforward measurement due to the coastline paradox, which states that a coastline does not have a well-defined length. Different sources provide varying estimates based on the measurement methods and scales used. However, we can provide some approximate figures:

1. According to the World Factbook, the total length of coastlines in the world is approximately 356,000 km[1].

2. The Wikipedia article on coasts states that Earth contains roughly 620,000 km (390,000 mi) of coastline[2].

3. Other sources provide even higher estimates. For instance, the World Resources Institute calculated a total global coastline length of 1,634,701 km based on measurements from the World Vector Shoreline database at a 1:250,000 scale[5].

The significant variation in these figures is due to the fractal-like properties of coastlines. As explained by the coastline paradox:

1. The measured length of a coastline depends on the method used and the degree of cartographic generalization[2].

2. The smaller the scale interval (i.e., the more detailed the measurement), the longer the coastline will appear[5].

3. This "magnifying" effect is more pronounced for convoluted coastlines than for relatively smooth ones[5].

For example, the coast of Great Britain measures about 2,400 km when using an interval of 200 km, but increases to about 3,400 km when measured with a 50 km interval[5].

Given these factors, it's important to note that any single figure for the Earth's total coastline length is an approximation. The most commonly cited range falls between 356,000 km and 1,634,701 km, with the lower end being a more generalized measurement and the higher end representing a more detailed analysis.
