The Heian period (平安時代, Heian jidai) is considered the final phase of classical Japanese history[1]. This period ran from 794 to 1185 CE and followed the Nara period[1][7].

The Heian period is often referred to as the golden age of classical Japanese culture[7]. It began when Emperor Kammu, the 50th emperor of Japan, moved the capital from Nara to Heian-kyō (modern-day Kyoto) in 794[1]. The name "Heian" means "peace" in Japanese, reflecting the relative stability of this era[1].

Key aspects of the Heian period include:

1. Political developments: The Fujiwara clan rose to prominence, effectively ruling Japan through intermarriage with the imperial family and holding positions like sesshō (regent) and kampaku (chief adviser)[1].

2. Cultural flourishing: This era saw the peak of classical Japanese culture, including advancements in literature, poetry, art, and aesthetics[3][7].

3. Religious influence: Buddhism and Taoism had significant impacts on Japanese society during this time[3].

4. Social structure: The period was characterized by a highly refined court culture centered in Kyoto[7].

5. Decline of central authority: Towards the end of the period, imperial power began to wane as the warrior class (bushi) gained influence in the provinces[7].

The Heian period came to an end in 1185 with the conclusion of the Genpei War between the Taira and Minamoto clans[7]. This conflict marked the transition from the classical era to the medieval period of Japanese history, ushering in the age of the samurai and the establishment of the first shogunate.
