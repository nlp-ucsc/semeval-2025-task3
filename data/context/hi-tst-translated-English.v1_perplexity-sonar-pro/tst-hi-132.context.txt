The priests called Magi belonged to Zoroastrianism and earlier Iranian religions[1][2]. Here are some key details about the Magi:

1. Origin and Role:
- The term "Magi" (plural) or "Magus" (singular) referred to priests in Zoroastrianism and earlier Iranian religions[2].
- They were the only recorded designation of priests for all western Iranians during the Median, Achaemenid, Parthian, and Sasanian periods[1].

2. Historical Context:
- The earliest known use of the word "magi" is in the trilingual Behistun Inscription by Darius the Great[2].
- According to Herodotus, the Magi were one of six Median tribes and formed a hereditary priestly clan[1].

3. Functions and Influence:
- The Magi were official priests of the Achaemenid kings and held significant influence at the royal court[1].
- They performed various religious functions, including cultic libations to rivers and mountains, and making sacrifices of livestock[1].
- They were also engaged in administrative and economic activities[1].

4. Knowledge and Abilities:
- The Magi were known as priests and scholars possessing special knowledge[4].
- They had a reputation as astrologers, which explains the biblical account of them following a star to find Jesus[4].
- They were considered experts in astronomy, astrology, alchemy, and other forms of esoteric knowledge[2].

5. Modern Context:
- The hereditary Zoroastrian priesthood has survived in India and Iran, with priests now termed Herbad, Mobad, and Dastur depending on their rank[2].

It's important to note that while the Magi are most famously associated with Zoroastrianism, the term later expanded to include various forms of esoteric knowledge and practices, influencing the modern words "magic" and "magician"[2].
