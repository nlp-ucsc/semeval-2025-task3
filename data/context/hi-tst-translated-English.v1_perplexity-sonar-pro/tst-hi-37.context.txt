The extent of the coastal plain from the seashore or riverbank can vary significantly depending on the specific location and how it is defined. Based on the search results, there is no single universal distance that applies everywhere. However, I can provide some key insights:

1. Variable Extent: The coastal plain can extend inland anywhere from a few hundred feet to several miles, depending on the topography and geological features of the area[1][2][7].

2. State-Specific Definitions: Different states and jurisdictions define their coastal zones differently for regulatory purposes. For example:

   - In California, the coastal zone generally extends 1,000 yards (about 914 meters) inland from the mean high tide line[1].
   - In New York, the inland boundary is approximately 1,000 feet (about 305 meters) from the shoreline in most areas, but can extend up to 10,000 feet (about 3 kilometers) inland in some locations[1].
   - In Indiana, the coastal zone extends up to 17 miles inland at its widest point[1].

3. Physiographic Definitions: From a geological perspective, the Atlantic Coastal Plain in the United States extends 50 to 100 kilometers inland on average[3].

4. Elevation Considerations: The coastal plain is typically characterized by low elevations. For instance, in South Carolina, few places in the Coastal Plain are higher than 600 feet (about 183 meters) above sea level[4].

5. Large-Scale Examples: The Gulf Coastal Plain of North America extends about 981 miles (1,579 km) northwards from the Gulf of Mexico[5]. The Coastal Plain province in the U.S. stretches over 3,540 km (2,200 mi) from Cape Cod to the Mexican border[7].

6. Legal Boundaries: For certain regulatory purposes, coastal boundaries may be more narrowly defined. For example, Texas claims jurisdiction over Gulf waters extending 9 nautical miles (about 16.7 km) from the shoreline[8].

7. Geological Formation: The Virginia Coastal Plain is underlain by a wedge of sediments that increases in thickness from a thin edge near the Fall Zone to more than 4,000 meters under the continental shelf[9].

In summary, the extent of the coastal plain from the seashore or riverbank can range from a few hundred feet to over 100 kilometers, depending on geological features, state regulations, and the specific definition being used. The variation is significant, and it's important to consider the context (geological, legal, or regulatory) when determining the extent of a coastal plain in a particular area.
