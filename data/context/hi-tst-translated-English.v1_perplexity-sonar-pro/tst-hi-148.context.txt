The Corsican flag consists of two colors:

1. White
2. Black

The flag features a white background with a black Moor's head in profile[1][2][3]. Specifically:

- The background of the flag is white[1][2][3].
- The central emblem is a black Moor's head, facing left, in profile[1][2][3].
- The Moor's head wears a white bandana or headband across the forehead[1][2][3].

This simple yet striking two-color design makes the Corsican flag highly recognizable. The white background symbolizes purity and peace, while the black Moor's head represents Corsica's historical struggle for freedom and independence[2][3]. The white bandana, positioned above the eyes rather than covering them, is said to symbolize the liberation of the Corsican people[3].

The flag, known in Corsican as "a bandiera testa mora" (the flag with the Moor's head), was officially adopted in 1755 by Pasquale Paoli, the leader of the Corsican Republic[3]. It has since become a powerful emblem of Corsican identity and culture, widely used throughout the island at festivals, cultural events, and as a symbol of Corsican pride[1][3].
