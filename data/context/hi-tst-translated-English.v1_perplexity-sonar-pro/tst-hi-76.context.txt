The diameter of a hydrogen nucleus is approximately 2.40 × 10^-15 meters[1]. This incredibly small size represents the diameter of a single proton, which constitutes the nucleus of a hydrogen atom.

To put this minuscule dimension into perspective:

1. Comparison to the atom: The hydrogen atom itself, including its electron cloud, has a diameter of about 1.06 × 10^-10 meters[1]. This means the nucleus is roughly 44,167 times smaller in diameter than the entire atom.

2. Scale analogy: If we were to scale up a hydrogen atom to the size of a typical sports stadium (about 200 meters in diameter), the nucleus would be smaller than a grain of sand at the center.

3. Density implication: The extremely small size of the nucleus compared to the overall atom indicates that atoms are mostly empty space. The vast majority of an atom's volume is occupied by the electron cloud, while the dense nucleus contains nearly all of the atom's mass.

4. Measurement challenges: Measuring such small distances requires highly sophisticated techniques and equipment. The size of atomic nuclei is typically determined through various experimental methods in nuclear physics, such as electron scattering experiments.

5. Quantum effects: At this scale, classical concepts of size become less meaningful, and the nucleus is better described by quantum mechanical models that consider probability distributions rather than definite boundaries.

This incredibly small size of the hydrogen nucleus underscores the vast differences in scale within the atomic world and highlights the challenges in studying and conceptualizing subatomic structures.
