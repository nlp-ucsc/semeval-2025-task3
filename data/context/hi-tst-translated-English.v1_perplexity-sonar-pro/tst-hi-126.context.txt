Palmitoleic acid is found in high concentrations in the liver and adipose tissue (fat tissue) in humans[4][5]. 

To provide more details:

1. Distribution in the body:
   - Palmitoleic acid is present in all human tissues[4][5].
   - However, it is particularly enriched in the liver and adipose tissue compared to other organs[4].

2. Liver concentration:
   - The liver contains higher concentrations of palmitoleic acid compared to most other organs[5].
   - This is likely due to the liver's central role in lipid metabolism and fatty acid synthesis.

3. Adipose tissue concentration:
   - Adipose tissue also contains high levels of palmitoleic acid[4].
   - It is a common constituent of the glycerides (fat molecules) found in human adipose tissue[5].

4. Biosynthesis:
   - Palmitoleic acid is synthesized in the body from palmitic acid through the action of the enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD)[4].
   - This biosynthesis primarily occurs in the liver and adipose tissue, contributing to the higher concentrations found in these organs.

5. Significance:
   - The high concentration of palmitoleic acid in the liver is particularly noteworthy due to its potential roles in metabolic health and liver function[3].
   - Research has shown that palmitoleic acid may have beneficial effects on liver health, including reducing hepatic steatosis (fatty liver) and improving insulin sensitivity[3][4].

In summary, while palmitoleic acid is found throughout the human body, it is most concentrated in the liver and adipose tissue, with the liver being a key site of both its synthesis and its metabolic actions.
