The main river of the province of Almería is the Andarax River[3][8]. This river plays a significant role in the geography and hydrology of the region:

1. Length and Origin: The Andarax River is approximately 90 kilometers long and originates at an altitude of over 1,900 meters[3].

2. Historical Importance: The Andarax River has been foundational for many civilizations that settled along its banks. It has been used since ancient times as a means of transport and passage between different areas of the province[3].

3. Agricultural Impact: The continuous flow of water from the Andarax River has transformed the surrounding valley into a fertile area where agriculture has flourished. This has been crucial for the survival and development of local communities[3].

4. Ecological Significance: The river and its surrounding areas have become popular for natural tourism, promoting activities such as hiking, canyoning, and trekking[3].

5. Settlements: More than 20 villages are located around the Andarax Valley, gaining tourist popularity for various reasons, including agricultural production, gastronomy, and marble production[3].

6. Recreational Use: The Andarax River is also used for various sports and recreational activities, including kayaking, canoeing, rowing, and sport fishing[3].

It's worth noting that while the Andarax is the main river, Almería province also has other significant rivers:

- The Almanzora River, which is another important waterway in the region[8].
- The Adra River, which begins in Sierra Nevada in the province of Granada and is considered one of the most important rivers in Almería due to its significant water flow[4].

These rivers collectively contribute to the unique geography, ecology, and economy of Almería province.
