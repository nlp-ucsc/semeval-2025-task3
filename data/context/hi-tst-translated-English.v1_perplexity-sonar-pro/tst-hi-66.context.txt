Mr. Peabody & Sherman was released in 2014. Specifically:

- It premiered on February 7, 2014 in the United Kingdom[1][3].

- The film was released theatrically on March 7, 2014 in the United States[1][3][4].

The movie had gone through several release date changes before settling on these dates. It was originally scheduled for March 2014, then moved up to November 2013, before finally being pushed back to March 2014[3]. This final shift was reportedly due to DreamWorks Animation wanting a "more advantageous release window" for the film[3].

Mr. Peabody & Sherman is an American 3D computer-animated comedy adventure film based on characters from the "Peabody's Improbable History" segments of the animated TV series The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show. It was produced by DreamWorks Animation and directed by Rob Minkoff[1][3].
