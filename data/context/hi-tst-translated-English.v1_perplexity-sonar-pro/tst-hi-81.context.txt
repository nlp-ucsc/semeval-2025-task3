Thomas Hardy's first wife was Emma Lavinia Gifford[1][2][5]. She was born on November 24, 1840, in Plymouth, Devon, and was an English writer and suffragist[1]. Emma met Thomas Hardy in 1870 when he was working as an architect and had been commissioned to prepare a report on the condition of St Julitta's church near Boscastle in Cornwall[1][10].

Emma and Thomas Hardy married on September 17, 1874, at St Peter's Church in Paddington, London[1][8]. Their courtship inspired Hardy's third novel, "A Pair of Blue Eyes"[1]. Emma was known for her vivid blue eyes, long auburn ringlets, and rosy cheeks, and was described as having a girlish, cheerful, and lively nature[3].

Initially, Emma encouraged Hardy to pursue his writing career full-time[4]. However, their marriage became increasingly strained over the years due to various factors, including their inability to have children, tensions with Hardy's mother, and Hardy's flirtations with other women[8]. They eventually lived separate lives within the same house[7].

Emma died on November 27, 1912[1]. After her death, Hardy experienced intense grief and wrote numerous poems dedicated to her memory, idealizing their early relationship[6][7]. This outpouring of emotion for his deceased first wife caused distress to Florence Dugdale, whom Hardy married in 1914, two years after Emma's death[6][7].
