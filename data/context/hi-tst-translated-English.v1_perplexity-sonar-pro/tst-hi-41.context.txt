Duralumin is an aluminum alloy composed of several key components:

Aluminum (Al): This is the primary component, making up approximately 91-95% of the alloy[1][3]. Aluminum provides the base material and contributes to the alloy's lightweight properties.

Copper (Cu): Copper is the second most abundant element in duralumin, typically comprising 3.8-4.9% of the alloy[1][3]. It significantly enhances the strength and hardness of the material.

Magnesium (Mg): Magnesium is present in smaller quantities, usually 0.5-1.8%[1][3]. It contributes to the alloy's strength and improves its corrosion resistance.

Manganese (Mn): Manganese is added in small amounts, typically 0.5-1%[2][3]. It helps to improve the alloy's strength and workability.

In some formulations, small amounts of other elements may be present:

Silicon (Si): Some variations of duralumin may contain small amounts of silicon[2], which can improve the alloy's castability and reduce its thermal expansion.

The exact percentages of these components can vary slightly depending on the specific formulation and intended application of the duralumin alloy. The combination of these elements results in a material that is strong, lightweight, and relatively ductile, making it ideal for applications in aerospace, automotive, and other industries where high strength-to-weight ratio is crucial[2][4].

It's worth noting that duralumin was one of the first age-hardenable aluminum alloys, discovered by German metallurgist Alfred Wilm in 1906[2][4]. Its development significantly advanced the field of metallurgy and played a crucial role in the early days of aircraft construction.
