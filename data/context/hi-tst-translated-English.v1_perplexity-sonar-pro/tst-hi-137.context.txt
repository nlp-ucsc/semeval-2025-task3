Indianapolis was founded in 1820 and officially established in 1821 as the new state capital of Indiana[1][2]. Here are the key details about the founding of Indianapolis:

In 1820, the Indiana General Assembly authorized a committee to select a site in central Indiana for the new state capital[1]. On January 11, 1820, this committee was formed to choose the location for the permanent seat of state government[5].

In 1821, the site was officially selected and the city was platted (mapped out)[3]. Specifically:

- On January 6, 1821, the state legislature approved the site and adopted the name Indianapolis[2].

- In April 1821, Alexander Ralston and Elias Pym Fordham were appointed to survey and design the town plan for Indianapolis[1][2].

- Ralston's original plan for Indianapolis called for a 1-square-mile (2.6 kmÂ²) grid layout, centered around a large circular commons which later became known as Monument Circle[1][4].

The city was incorporated as a town in 1832, and then became an incorporated city on March 30, 1847[1][2].

It's worth noting that while the city was founded in 1820-1821, the area had been inhabited by Native Americans long before that. The land where Indianapolis now stands was originally home to the Lenape (Delaware Nation), who relinquished their tribal lands in the Treaty of St. Mary's in 1818[1][2].
