The equivalent goddess to Diana in ancient Greek religion was Artemis. Artemis was a major Olympian goddess associated with hunting, wild animals, the wilderness, childbirth, and the moon[1][2][4]. 

Key aspects of Artemis include:

1. Goddess of the hunt: She was primarily known as the goddess of hunting and wild animals, often depicted with a bow and arrows[1][4].

2. Nature deity: Artemis was associated with the wilderness, forests, mountains, and wildlife[1][3].

3. Protector of young women: She was considered a protector of young girls until they married[4].

4. Goddess of childbirth: Artemis was invoked by women to aid in conception and delivery[2].

5. Moon goddess: Later in her mythology, she became associated with the moon, absorbing attributes of Selene (Luna)[1][2].

6. Virgin goddess: Artemis was one of the three major virgin goddesses in Greek mythology, alongside Athena and Hestia[8].

7. Twin of Apollo: In most myths, Artemis is the twin sister of Apollo, both born to Zeus and Leto[4][8].

The Romans adopted Artemis into their pantheon as Diana, and the two goddesses became essentially synonymous, sharing most attributes and myths[1][2]. Both were depicted similarly in art, often shown wearing a short chiton (tunic) for ease of movement while hunting, carrying a bow and quiver, and accompanied by hunting dogs[1][4].

As with many ancient deities, the roles and attributes of Artemis/Diana evolved over time and varied somewhat between different regions and cultures within the Greek and Roman worlds[3][8].
