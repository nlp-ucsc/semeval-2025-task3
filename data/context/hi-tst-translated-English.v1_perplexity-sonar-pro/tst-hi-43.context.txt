The time equation defines two main types of solar time differences:

1. Apparent solar time vs. mean solar time

The primary difference described by the equation of time is between apparent solar time and mean solar time[5][8][9]. 

Apparent solar time (also called true solar time) is based on the actual observed position of the Sun in the sky[5]. It varies throughout the year due to the Earth's elliptical orbit and axial tilt.

Mean solar time is based on a fictional "mean Sun" that moves at a constant rate[5]. This is the uniform 24-hour day we use for civil timekeeping.

The equation of time quantifies the difference between these two types of solar time throughout the year, which can be up to about 16 minutes[8][9].

2. Local solar time vs. local clock time 

The equation of time is also used to calculate the difference between local solar time and local clock time at a given location[7]. This accounts for:

- The longitude difference between the location and the standard meridian of its time zone
- The equation of time (apparent vs. mean solar time difference)

So in summary, the equation of time defines the difference between:
1) Apparent and mean solar time
2) Local solar time and local clock time

These two types of solar time differences are closely related, with the apparent vs. mean solar time difference being a key component in calculating local solar time vs. local clock time.
