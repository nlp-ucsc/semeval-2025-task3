The area of Vatican City is 49 hectares (121 acres) or 0.49 square kilometers (0.19 square miles)[1][3]. This makes Vatican City the smallest independent state in the world by both area and population[1].

To put this size into perspective:

1. It's approximately one-eighth the size of Central Park in New York City[4].
2. It's equivalent to about 90 American football fields[4].
3. It takes around 40 minutes to walk the entire perimeter of Vatican City[6].
4. It's about 0.7 times the size of the National Mall in Washington, DC[7].

The territory of Vatican City includes:

- St. Peter's Basilica and Square
- The Apostolic Palace (the Pope's residence)
- The Vatican Museums and Gardens
- Various administrative buildings

Despite its small size, Vatican City has a significant global influence as the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church and home to some of the world's most famous art and architectural treasures, including the Sistine Chapel[4].

It's worth noting that while most sources agree on the 49 hectares figure, some variations exist. For instance, some sources mention 44 hectares[6][8]. This discrepancy might be due to different measurement methods or the inclusion/exclusion of certain areas. However, the officially recognized and most commonly cited area is 49 hectares.
