2001: A Space Odyssey received 4 Academy Award nominations[1][3]. The nominations were for:

1. Best Director (Stanley Kubrick)
2. Best Original Screenplay (Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke)
3. Best Art Direction (Tony Masters, Harry Lange, Ernie Archer)
4. Best Visual Effects

The film won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, which was awarded to Stanley Kubrick as the director of special effects on the film[3][5]. This was Kubrick's only personal Academy Award win among his 13 total nominations across his career[6].

It's worth noting that despite its now-legendary status in film history, 2001: A Space Odyssey was not nominated for Best Picture[2]. This omission is often cited as one of the great Oscar injustices, as many film critics and historians consider it to be one of the greatest and most influential films ever made[2].

The film did receive recognition in other award ceremonies, including multiple BAFTA wins for Cinematography, Music Score, and Art Direction[9]. It also won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation in 1969[1].
