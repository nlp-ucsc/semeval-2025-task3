Traditionalism as a philosophical and theological movement primarily developed in the 19th and early 20th centuries, though its roots can be traced back to earlier periods.

The 19th century saw the emergence of Traditionalism as a distinct philosophical and theological doctrine within Catholicism. This form of Traditionalism, sometimes referred to as "19th-century Catholic Traditionalism," held that the principal truths of a metaphysical and moral nature could only be attained through God's revelation, rather than through human reason alone[2]. This movement was a response to the upheavals of the French Revolution and the Enlightenment, seeking a stable principle of order in a rapidly changing world.

However, the more well-known form of Traditionalism, often associated with figures like René Guénon and Julius Evola, emerged in the early 20th century. This strain of Traditionalism, sometimes called "Perennialism," posits the existence of a primordial, universal wisdom that has been lost in the modern world[1][4]. 

Key developments in 20th-century Traditionalism include:

1. René Guénon's works in the 1920s and 1930s, which laid the foundation for much of modern Traditionalist thought[9].

2. The emergence of Traditionalist Catholic movements in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly in response to the Second Vatican Council[6].

3. The influence of Traditionalist ideas on far-right political thought, especially through the work of Julius Evola[4].

It's important to note that while Traditionalism as a formal philosophical movement developed primarily in the 19th and 20th centuries, it draws heavily on much older ideas and traditions, often claiming to represent timeless, perennial wisdom[7][9].
