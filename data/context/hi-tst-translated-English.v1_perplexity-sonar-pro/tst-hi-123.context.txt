Booker T. Washington was most likely born in 1856, though the exact date of his birth was uncertain during his lifetime[1][4][5].

Several key points about Washington's birth year:

1. Washington himself was unsure of his exact birth date. In his autobiography "Up from Slavery," he estimated he was born in 1858 or 1859[5].

2. After Washington's death, his older half-brother John H. Washington reported seeing April 5, 1856 recorded as Booker's birth date in the Burroughs family Bible. The Burroughs family owned Washington's mother[5][6].

3. Based on this information, the Tuskegee Institute trustees formally adopted April 5, 1856 as Washington's official birth date shortly after his death[5].

4. The 1856 birth year is now widely accepted and appears on Washington's headstone[4][5].

5. Some sources suggest Washington may have been born as early as 1854 or 1855 based on records of his age when he enrolled at Hampton Institute[5].

While there is some uncertainty, the consensus among historians and biographers is that 1856 is the most likely year of Booker T. Washington's birth, with April 5 being accepted as his official birth date[1][3][4][6][7].
