Rosalind Elsie Franklin died of ovarian cancer on April 16, 1958, at the age of 37[1][4][7]. She was first diagnosed with ovarian cancer in mid-1956 when she noticed abdominal swelling during a work trip to the United States[1]. Despite undergoing surgery and experimental chemotherapy treatments, Franklin's cancer progressed, and she experienced only a brief 10-month remission[1][4].

Despite her illness, Franklin continued her scientific work almost until the end of her life. She published several papers on viruses in 1956 and 1957 while undergoing cancer treatment[1][6]. Her dedication to science remained strong even as her health declined.

Franklin's early death at 37 years old cut short a brilliant scientific career. It also prevented her from being eligible for the Nobel Prize awarded in 1962 for the discovery of DNA's structure, as Nobel Prizes are not given posthumously[6]. Some have speculated that her cancer may have been linked to her work with X-rays, as she often worked without proper radiation shielding[5]. However, it's also noted that there was a high incidence of gynecological cancers in her family, and among Ashkenazi Jews in general[1][7].

Franklin's untimely death due to ovarian cancer remains a poignant aspect of her legacy, highlighting both the risks faced by early radiation researchers and the tragic loss of a brilliant scientific mind at the peak of her career.
