The national motto of Greece is "Ελευθερία ή θάνατος" (Eleftheria i Thanatos), which translates to "Freedom or Death" in English[1][2][5]. This powerful phrase encapsulates the Greek spirit of independence and their historical struggle for liberty.

This motto has deep historical roots, originating during the Greek War of Independence in the 1820s[5]. It was adopted in 1814 by a secret organization called Filiki Eteria, which aimed to overthrow Ottoman rule[1]. During the Greek War of Independence in the 1820s, it became a rallying cry for the Greek rebels fighting against Ottoman domination[1][5].

The significance of this motto is reflected in various national symbols of Greece:

1. National Flag: The Greek flag, known as "galanolefki" (blue and white), features nine horizontal stripes - five blue and four white. These nine stripes represent the nine syllables of the motto "Ελευθερία ή θάνατος"[1][3][4].

2. Symbolism: The motto embodies the Greek people's unwavering commitment to freedom, even at the cost of their lives. It represents the valor and determination of the Greek struggle for independence[1].

3. Cultural Impact: The phrase has become deeply ingrained in Greek culture and national identity, serving as a reminder of the country's hard-fought independence and the value placed on liberty[5].

This motto continues to be an important part of Greek national identity, symbolizing the country's historical struggles and its ongoing commitment to freedom and independence.
