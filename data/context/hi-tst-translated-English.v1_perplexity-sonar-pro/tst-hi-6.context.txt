Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is the full name of the condition commonly abbreviated as GB syndrome[1][2][3]. It is pronounced "ghee-YAN bah-RAY" syndrome[1][4].

Guillain-Barré syndrome is a rare neurological disorder in which a person's immune system mistakenly attacks part of their peripheral nervous system[1]. This immune attack leads to nerve inflammation that causes muscle weakness, numbness, tingling sensations, and in severe cases, paralysis[2][3].

Some key points about Guillain-Barré syndrome:

1. It is an autoimmune condition, meaning the body's immune system attacks its own tissues by mistake[2].

2. GBS typically begins with weakness and tingling in the extremities, often starting in the legs and spreading to the arms and upper body[1][3].

3. Symptoms can progress rapidly, sometimes leading to complete paralysis within hours or days[1].

4. While the exact cause is unknown, GBS often occurs following a viral or bacterial infection[2][4].

5. It is considered a medical emergency and usually requires hospitalization for treatment and monitoring[3].

6. Most people with GBS recover fully, though the recovery process can take weeks to years, and some may experience lasting nerve damage[1][3].

Guillain-Barré syndrome is named after two French neurologists, Georges Guillain and Jean Alexandre Barré, who first described the condition in 1916 along with André Strohl[1][2].
