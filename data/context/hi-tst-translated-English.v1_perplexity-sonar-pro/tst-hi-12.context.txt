According to the information provided in the search results, only a small percentage of the world's deserts are actually covered in sand. Specifically:

About 10-20% of desert areas consist of sandy dunes or sand sheets[3][4]. The majority of desert landscapes are made up of other features like gravel plains, rock formations, and dry valleys. 

Some key points about the sandy portions of deserts:

- Sand dunes cover only about 10% of the world's deserts[4].

- In the Gobi Desert, only 3% of the Mongolian side is composed of sand dunes[4].

- The Arabian Desert, one of the largest in the world, is about 50% sandy terrain[4].

- In Australia's deserts, sand dunes are present but make up a minority of the total desert area[4].

- The Sahara, while often imagined as entirely sandy, has large areas of rocky plateau and mountains in addition to its famous dune fields[4].

So while sand and dunes are iconic features associated with deserts, they actually make up a relatively small portion of total desert land area globally. The majority of desert landscapes consist of other arid landforms and surfaces. This misconception likely stems from the dramatic and photogenic nature of sand dunes, which feature prominently in depictions of deserts despite not being the dominant land cover type in most arid regions.
