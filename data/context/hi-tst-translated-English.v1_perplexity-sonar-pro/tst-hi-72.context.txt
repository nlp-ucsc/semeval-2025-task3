"Hidden Figures" is a film that tells the remarkable true story of three African-American women mathematicians who played crucial roles in NASA's early space program during the 1960s[1][2]. The movie focuses on Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson, who worked as "computers" at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia[1][2].

Key aspects of the film and the historical events it portrays include:

1. Historical context: The story is set against the backdrop of the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as the Civil Rights movement in America[1][7].

2. Main characters:
   - Katherine Johnson (played by Taraji P. Henson): A mathematical prodigy who calculated flight trajectories for Project Mercury and other missions[1][8].
   - Dorothy Vaughan (played by Octavia Spencer): An unofficial supervisor who became NASA's first African-American supervisor and an expert FORTRAN programmer[2][5].
   - Mary Jackson (played by Janelle Mon√°e): An aspiring engineer who became NASA's first African-American female engineer[2][3].

3. Workplace challenges: The women faced both racial and gender discrimination at NASA, including segregated facilities and skepticism about their abilities[1][5].

4. Contributions to space program:
   - Katherine Johnson's calculations were critical for the success of John Glenn's orbital mission and other spaceflights[5][8].
   - Dorothy Vaughan adapted to the introduction of electronic computers, learning and teaching FORTRAN to her colleagues[2][5].
   - Mary Jackson pursued an engineering degree, overcoming legal barriers to attend classes at an all-white school[1][3].

5. Recognition: The work of these women was largely unrecognized for many years. The film and subsequent attention have helped bring their contributions to light[6][8].

6. Legacy: The story of these "hidden figures" has inspired many, particularly in encouraging women and minorities to pursue STEM careers[6][9].

The film not only highlights the scientific achievements of these women but also portrays their personal lives and the social challenges they faced during a pivotal time in American history[1][6].
