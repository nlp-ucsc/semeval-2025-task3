The Kuru Empire was primarily associated with the Vedic religion, which later developed into Brahmanism and eventually evolved into Hinduism. Here are the key points about the religious associations of the Kuru Empire:

1. Vedic Religion: The Kuru dynasty played a significant role in the development and spread of the Vedic religion[1][3]. This was the earliest form of the religious tradition that would later evolve into Hinduism.

2. Brahmanism: During the late Vedic period (c. 1100–500 BCE), Brahmanism developed out of the Vedic religion. It was an ideology associated with the Kuru-Panchala realm, which expanded into a wider area after the decline of the Kuru-Pancala kingdom[3].

3. Cultural Significance: The Kuru dynasty held great cultural and religious importance in Hindu mythology and literature. It is prominently featured in texts like the Mahabharata, one of the major Sanskrit epics of ancient India[2].

4. Vedic Rituals: The Kuru kingdom was known for its emphasis on Vedic rituals and sacrifices. For example, Kuru, son of Saiṅvaraṇa, built a yāgaśālā (sacrificial hall) between the rivers Sarasvatī and Dṛśadvatī, which later became known as Kurukṣetra[2].

5. Philosophical Developments: The Kuru-Panchala region was also associated with the development of early Upanishadic thought, which began to philosophically interpret earlier Vedic rituals and introduce concepts like Brahman (the Absolute Reality)[3].

6. Syncretism: The religion of the Kuru Empire was not static but evolved over time, incorporating elements from local religious traditions and developing new philosophical ideas[3].

It's important to note that the religion of the Kuru Empire was not exactly the same as modern Hinduism. It was a precursor that laid the foundation for many concepts and practices that would later be incorporated into Hinduism. The Kuru dynasty's religious practices and beliefs represented a crucial stage in the development of Indian religious thought, bridging the early Vedic religion with later Brahmanical traditions.
