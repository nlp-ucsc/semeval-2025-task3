The modern capital, Kingstown, was founded by French settlers shortly after 1722[6][8]. While the exact date of establishment is not specified in the search results, multiple sources consistently point to 1722 as the year when French colonists founded the settlement that would become Kingstown.

Some key points about Kingstown's establishment and early history:

1. French origins: The city was initially established by French settlers in 1722[2][6].

2. British rule: Although founded by the French, Saint Vincent (including Kingstown) later came under British rule. The island was under British control for 196 years before gaining independence[6].

3. Colonial transitions: The area passed between French and British hands multiple times during the colonial era[5].

4. Capital status: Kingstown became the capital of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines when the country gained full independence in 1979[2][9].

5. Historical significance: Kingstown has served as an important port and administrative center throughout its history[5].

It's worth noting that while 1722 marks the establishment of the modern city, the area had been inhabited by indigenous Carib people before European colonization[8]. The city's development and importance grew over time, especially during the colonial period and after independence.
