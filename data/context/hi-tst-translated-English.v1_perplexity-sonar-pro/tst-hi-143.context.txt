Five of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World were created by the ancient Greeks[3][5]. These Greek-created wonders are:

1. The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus
2. The Statue of Zeus at Olympia
3. The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus
4. The Colossus of Rhodes
5. The Lighthouse of Alexandria

The other two wonders on the traditional list were:

6. The Great Pyramid of Giza (created by the ancient Egyptians)
7. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon (attributed to the Babylonians or Assyrians, though its existence is still debated)

This list of Seven Wonders originated in the Hellenistic period, with the earliest known compilation dating back to the 2nd-1st century BC[1]. It's worth noting that the list evolved over time, with some variations in different ancient sources. For example, earlier versions included the Walls of Babylon instead of the Lighthouse of Alexandria[1].

The predominance of Greek-created wonders on this list reflects the Hellenistic perspective of the ancient travelers and writers who compiled it. These monuments were seen as the pinnacle of architectural and artistic achievement in the known world at that time, showcasing the cultural and technological prowess of ancient Greek civilization[3][5].

It's important to note that while five of these wonders were created by Greeks, they were not all located within the borders of modern Greece. The Temple of Artemis and the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus were in what is now Turkey, and the Lighthouse of Alexandria was in Egypt[1]. This geographical spread demonstrates the wide-reaching influence of Greek culture throughout the ancient Mediterranean and Near East.
