Kyriakos Mitsotakis was born on March 4, 1968 in Athens, Greece[1][2][3]. 

Some key details about his birth and early life:

- He was born into a prominent Greek political family. His father, Konstantinos Mitsotakis, later served as Prime Minister of Greece from 1990 to 1993[1].

- At the time of Kyriakos' birth, his family was under house arrest by the Greek military junta that had taken power in a coup[1]. 

- When he was about 6 months old, the family escaped to Turkey with help from the Turkish Foreign Minister, and then moved to Paris[1].

- The Mitsotakis family returned to Greece in 1973, when Kyriakos was about 5 years old[1].

So Kyriakos Mitsotakis was born during a turbulent time in Greek politics, with his early months spent in exile before returning to Greece as a young child. He would go on to follow in his family's political footsteps, eventually becoming Prime Minister himself in 2019.
