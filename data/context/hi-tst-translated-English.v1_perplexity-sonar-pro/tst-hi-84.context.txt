The town located on the Indian side of the Ganda Singh Wala border is Hussainiwala. Specifically:

Ganda Singh Wala is a village in Pakistan, located in Kasur District of Punjab province. It lies on the border with India, directly opposite the Indian village of Hussainiwala[1][2].

Hussainiwala is a village near Firozpur city in Firozpur district of Punjab state, India. It is situated on the Indian side of the border, across from Ganda Singh Wala in Pakistan[2].

Some key points about these two border villages:

1. They are named after people of different religions - Ganda Singh Wala is named after a Sikh man, while Hussainiwala is named after a Muslim saint[1][2].

2. Until 1986, this was the main border crossing between India and Pakistan before being replaced by the Wagah-Attari crossing[1].

3. Though the border crossing is now closed for travel, a daily flag lowering ceremony called the "Beating Retreat" is held here every evening at 6 pm, similar to the more famous ceremony at Wagah[1][2].

4. The ceremony here is considered more intimate than the one at Wagah, with attendees seated closer to each other across the border[1][8].

5. Both villages lie near the banks of the Sutlej River and are prone to flooding[1][2].

So in summary, Hussainiwala is the Indian town/village directly across the border from Ganda Singh Wala in Pakistan, forming this unique pair of border settlements.
