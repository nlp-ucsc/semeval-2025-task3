The field of expertise focused on the study of diseases occurring at relatively older ages is called geriatrics. Geriatrics is a medical specialty that concentrates on the care and treatment of older adults[1][7].

Geriatrics differs from gerontology, which is a broader, multidisciplinary field that studies aging and older adults in general. While gerontology encompasses various aspects of aging, including physical, mental, and social changes, geriatrics specifically focuses on the medical aspects and healthcare of older individuals[1][7].

Key points about geriatrics include:

1. Medical focus: Geriatrics deals with the diagnosis, management, and prevention of medical problems associated with senility and senescence[5].

2. Specialized care: Geriatricians are medical professionals who specialize in addressing the unique health needs and vulnerabilities of the elderly population[7].

3. Chronic diseases: Geriatrics often involves managing chronic conditions that are more prevalent in older adults, such as stroke, cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease[7].

4. Holistic approach: While focused on medical aspects, geriatrics also considers the overall well-being of older adults, including their physical, mental, and social health[7].

5. Aging-related changes: Geriatricians understand and address the natural aging processes that make older adults more susceptible to certain diseases and health issues[7].

It's important to note that while geriatrics concentrates on the medical aspects of aging, it works in conjunction with the broader field of gerontology to provide comprehensive care and understanding of the aging process[1][7].
