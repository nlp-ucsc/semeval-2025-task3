Akiko Morigami retired from professional tennis in 2009[1][2][10]. She announced her retirement on October 12, 2009, during a press conference held in Osaka, Japan[10]. This marked the end of her professional tennis career, which had spanned several years.

Morigami's retirement came after a notable career in which she achieved several accomplishments:

1. She reached a career-high ranking of 41 in the WTA rankings[4].
2. In 2007, she won her first and only WTA title at the Prague Open, defeating Marion Bartoli in the final[8].
3. She represented Japan in international competitions, including playing for the Japan Fed Cup team[9].

It's worth noting that Morigami's retirement came after a career that had seen some challenging moments, including an incident at the 2005 U.S. Open where she had to leave the court in a wheelchair due to severe body cramps[6]. Despite such setbacks, she continued to compete at a high level until her retirement in 2009.
