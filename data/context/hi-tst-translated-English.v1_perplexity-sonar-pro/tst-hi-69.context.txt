As of May 2009, there were 107 countries included in the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR)[10]. 

This information comes from a UNESCO news article that states: "Today the MAB-ICC decided to add 22 new sites from 17 countries to the UNESCO's World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR) which now counts 553 sites in 107 countries."

It's worth noting that the number of countries and biosphere reserves in the WNBR has grown significantly since 2009. More recent data from 2022 indicates that the network had expanded to include 738 biosphere reserves across 134 countries[1][2]. This growth demonstrates the increasing global recognition of the importance of these sites for conservation, sustainable development, and scientific research.
