The Fergana Valley extends across three countries in Central Asia[1][2][4]:

1. Uzbekistan: The valley lies mainly in eastern Uzbekistan, covering the largest portion of the region.

2. Kyrgyzstan: It extends into southern Kyrgyzstan.

3. Tajikistan: The valley also includes parts of northern Tajikistan.

This transboundary nature of the Fergana Valley has significant implications for the region's geopolitics, resource management, and ethnic relations[2][3]. The valley's division among these three countries dates back to the Soviet era when borders were drawn, often in complex and irregular ways[8]. This division has led to various challenges, including border disputes, water conflicts, and issues related to ethnic enclaves[4][9].
