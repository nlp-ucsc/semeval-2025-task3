Ingenuity, the small robotic coaxial rotor helicopter, landed on Mars on February 18, 2021, as part of NASA's Mars 2020 mission[1][2]. It arrived on the Martian surface attached to the underside of the Perseverance rover, which touched down in Jezero Crater on that date[3][6].

After landing, Ingenuity remained attached to Perseverance for several weeks. The helicopter was then deployed to the Martian surface over a multi-day period from March 26 to April 3, 2021[3]. This deployment process involved carefully lowering the helicopter from the rover's belly to the ground.

It's important to note that while Ingenuity landed on Mars with Perseverance in February 2021, its first powered, controlled flight on Mars didn't occur until April 19, 2021[5]. This historic flight marked the first time an aircraft had achieved powered, controlled flight on another planet[1][3].

Ingenuity went on to far exceed its original mission parameters, completing 72 flights over nearly three years before its final flight on January 18, 2024[4][7]. The helicopter's mission officially ended on January 25, 2024, after it was determined that damage sustained during its last landing had rendered it incapable of further flight[1][4].
