The main ideal of the Peshmerga Kurdish fighters is Kurdish nationalism and the pursuit of autonomy or independence for the Kurdish people, particularly in Iraq. This ideal has been at the core of the Peshmerga's existence and operations for decades[1][4][6].

The Peshmerga, whose name translates to "those who face death," have long been a symbol of Kurdish resistance and the struggle for self-determination[4][6]. Their origins can be traced back to the 18th century, when they began as tribal paramilitary border guards. Over time, they evolved into a disciplined guerrilla force fighting for Kurdish rights and autonomy[4].

Key aspects of the Peshmerga's ideals include:

1. Kurdish self-governance: The Peshmerga have fought to establish and protect Kurdish-controlled areas, particularly in northern Iraq. This culminated in the formation of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Iraq, where the Peshmerga serve as the official armed forces[1][4].

2. Resistance against oppression: Historically, the Peshmerga have fought against various regimes that have ruled over Kurdish areas, including the Ottoman Empire, the British Empire, and successive Iraqi governments[6].

3. Cultural and ethnic preservation: The Peshmerga see themselves as defenders of Kurdish culture, language, and identity against forces that have sought to suppress or assimilate Kurdish populations[8].

4. Territorial defense: In recent years, the Peshmerga have played a crucial role in defending Kurdish territories against external threats, most notably in the fight against the Islamic State (ISIS)[8].

5. International recognition: Through their military efforts and alliances, particularly in the fight against ISIS, the Peshmerga have sought to gain international recognition and support for Kurdish autonomy and rights[5][8].

It's important to note that while these ideals are central to the Peshmerga, the force has faced internal divisions, particularly between the two main Kurdish political parties in Iraq - the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). These divisions have at times complicated the pursuit of unified Kurdish goals[1][4][9].

Despite these challenges, the Peshmerga continue to embody the Kurdish struggle for self-determination and remain a powerful symbol of Kurdish nationalism and resistance.
