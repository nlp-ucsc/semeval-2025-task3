The First Crusade officially began on August 15, 1096[3][5]. This date was set by Pope Urban II as the official start of the crusade following his call to arms at the Council of Clermont on November 27, 1095[2][4].

However, it's important to note a few key events leading up to and surrounding this official start date:

1. In March 1095, Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos appealed to the West for aid against the Seljuk Turks[1].

2. On November 27, 1095, Pope Urban II called for the First Crusade at the Council of Clermont, urging Western Christians to recapture Jerusalem and the Holy Land[1][4].

3. Before the official start date, some groups set out early in what is known as the People's Crusade. These unofficial crusaders, led by Peter the Hermit, departed in March 1096[1][3].

4. The main crusader armies, led by various nobles, began gathering in Constantinople in fall 1096, after the official August 15 start date[3].

The First Crusade lasted from 1096 to 1099, culminating in the capture of Jerusalem on July 15, 1099[1][2]. The entire campaign, including the People's Crusade and subsequent battles, spanned from 1095 to 1102[1].
