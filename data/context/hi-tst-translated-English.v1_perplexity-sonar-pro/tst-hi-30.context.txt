The first day of the Gregorian calendar in 1424 was Saturday, January 1, 1424[4].

It's important to note that 1424 was a leap year in the Julian calendar, which was the calendar system in use at that time[4]. The Gregorian calendar, which we use today, was not introduced until 1582. However, we can retrospectively apply the Gregorian calendar to earlier dates for historical analysis and consistency.

Some key points about the year 1424:

1. It was part of the 15th century.
2. It was a leap year, meaning it had 366 days.
3. The year started on a Saturday and ended on a Saturday.

Regarding Easter in 1424, which was an important date in the Christian calendar, it fell on March 28th according to the Gregorian calendar calculation[1].

While this information is based on the Gregorian calendar, it's crucial to remember that people living in 1424 would have been using the Julian calendar. The transition to the Gregorian calendar happened much later and at different times in different countries, with some adopting it as late as the early 20th century.
