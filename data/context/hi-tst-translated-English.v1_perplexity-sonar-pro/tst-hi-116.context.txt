Kate Beckinsale played the character of Selene in the Underworld film series[1][2]. Selene is the main protagonist of the franchise, portrayed as an elite vampire assassin known as a "Death Dealer"[1]. Beckinsale appeared in four of the five Underworld films, starring in Underworld (2003), Underworld: Evolution (2006), Underworld: Awakening (2012), and Underworld: Blood Wars (2016)[2][4].

The character of Selene was created by Kevin Grevioux, Len Wiseman, and Danny McBride for the first Underworld film[1]. Beckinsale's portrayal of Selene significantly impacted her career, transforming her from an actress known primarily for costume dramas into an action star[5][7]. 

Selene's character is a skilled and ruthless vampire warrior who becomes central to the centuries-long war between vampires and Lycans (werewolves)[4]. Throughout the series, Selene evolves from a loyal soldier to a powerful and independent leader, undergoing major transformations and acquiring new powers[4].

Beckinsale has spoken about the challenges of taking on this action-oriented role, which was quite different from her previous work[5]. She noted that returning to the character for multiple films over more than a decade was an unusual experience for her as an actress[5].

The Underworld franchise, with Beckinsale as Selene, became a significant part of the actress's career and helped establish her as a versatile performer capable of both dramatic roles and action-packed performances[7].
