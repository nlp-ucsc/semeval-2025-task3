Bettina Heinen-Ayech was famous for depicting the colorful landscapes of Algeria[1][2][3]. She became particularly known for her vivid watercolor paintings of Algerian scenery, especially the landscapes around Guelma, her husband's hometown where she lived for many years[1][3].

Heinen-Ayech developed a unique technique to capture the intense colors and light of Algeria. Due to the dry air in Guelma, she had to adapt her watercolor method, applying strong colors in a mosaic-like fashion, "color stroke by color stroke"[1][3]. This technique allowed her to create vibrant images that reflected the distinctive landscapes and light of Algeria.

Her Algerian paintings often featured:

- The southern mountain Mahouna and its surrounding fields
- Spring scenes with green fields dotted with red poppies
- Summer landscapes with blue and purple mountain peaks rising above golden wheat fields  
- Winter scenes capturing the powerful red of the earth[1][3]

Heinen-Ayech's love for Algeria was deeply connected to her art. She described how the Algerian landscape captivated her senses and preserved her fantasies[1][3]. Her paintings of Algeria were not just visual representations but also conveyed the soul of the landscape, making it accessible even to those who had never visited the country[1][3].

Throughout her career, Heinen-Ayech's Algerian landscapes were widely exhibited and acclaimed. Her works were purchased by the National Museum in Algiers as early as 1968, and she received numerous honors from the Algerian government for her artistic contributions[1][3].
