Abel Tasman never actually landed on New Zealand soil[5][7]. While he was the first European to sight New Zealand in 1642, he did not set foot on land during his voyage[2][5].

Specifically:

- On December 13, 1642, Tasman and his crew became the first Europeans to sight New Zealand, spotting the northwest coast of the South Island[1][2][3].

- On December 18, 1642, Tasman's ships anchored in what is now known as Golden Bay, near the northern tip of the South Island[2][7].

- However, Tasman and his crew never went ashore in New Zealand. Their only attempt at landing resulted in a violent encounter with local MƒÅori in Golden Bay, during which four of Tasman's men were killed[1][7].

- After this incident, Tasman decided not to attempt further landings. He sailed around the north of the North Island and departed New Zealand waters on January 4, 1643, without ever setting foot on land[1][9].

So while Tasman was crucial in the European discovery of New Zealand in 1642, he never actually landed on New Zealand soil. The first recorded landing by Europeans in New Zealand would not occur until over 125 years later, when James Cook arrived in 1769[5].
