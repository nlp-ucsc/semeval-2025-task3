Alessandro Volta was born on February 18, 1745 in Como, Italy[1][2][3]. 

Como is a city located in the northern Italian region of Lombardy[2][9]. Volta was born into a noble family, though they were not particularly wealthy[10]. His full name was Alessandro Giuseppe Antonio Anastasio Volta[2][4].

Volta's birthplace was his family's ancestral home in the historic center of Como, specifically on Via Alessandro Volta[1]. A tombstone on this house (number 62) bears the inscription "This was the ancestral home of Alessandro Volta"[1]. 

Interestingly, Volta was baptized the day after his birth, on February 19, 1745, in the nearby Provostal church of San Donnino[1]. He would later die in this same house in Como in 1827, at the age of 82[1][9].
