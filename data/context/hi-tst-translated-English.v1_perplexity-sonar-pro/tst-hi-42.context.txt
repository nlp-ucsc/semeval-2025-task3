According to Hindu cosmology, there are 1000 Chaturyugas in one Kalpa[1][4]. A Kalpa represents one day of Brahma, which is equivalent to 4.32 billion solar years[1][4].

To break this down further:

1. A Kalpa is divided into 14 Manvantaras[1][4].

2. Each Manvantara consists of approximately 71 Chaturyugas[1][4]. Some sources round this to 71, while others use 71.4 to account for the full 1000 Chaturyugas in a Kalpa.

3. The precise calculation varies slightly between different texts:

   - Some accounts equate 1 Manvantara to exactly 71 Chaturyugas, resulting in 14 x 71 = 994 Chaturyugas per Kalpa. The remaining 6 Chaturyugas are accounted for as transition periods between Manvantaras[4].
   
   - Other accounts use 72 Chaturyugas per Manvantara, resulting in 72 x 14 = 1008 Chaturyugas in each Kalpa. This calculation is supported by Aryabhata in his Aryabhatiyam[4].

4. A Chaturyuga, also known as a Mahayuga, consists of four Yugas: Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga, and Kali Yuga[1][2].

5. The current cosmic cycle is said to be in the 28th Chaturyuga of the 7th Manvantara of the present Kalpa[6].

It's important to note that these time scales are incredibly vast and are part of the Hindu philosophical and cosmological understanding of cyclical time and the universe's creation and destruction cycles.
