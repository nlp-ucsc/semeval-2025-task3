The main languages spoken in Khovd province, Mongolia are:

1. Khalkha Mongolian: This is the official language of Mongolia and the most widely spoken language in Khovd province[1][2].

2. Oirat dialects: Several Oirat Mongolian dialects are spoken by different ethnic groups in Khovd, including:

   - Zakhchin: Spoken by the Zakhchin people, who make up a significant portion of the population[1][5].
   - Torguud: Used by the Torguud ethnic group[1][5].
   - Altai Uriankhai: Spoken in some districts (soums) of Khovd, particularly in Duut and Mönkhkhairkhan[1][3][5].
   - Ööld (or Olots): Used in Erdenebüren soum[3][5].
   - Dörvöd: Spoken by the Dörvöd ethnic group[5].

3. Kazakh: Spoken by the Kazakh minority, who form a significant portion of the population in some areas of Khovd province[1][2][5].

4. Tuvan: Used by a small Tuvan minority in the province[5][7].

It's important to note that Khovd is one of Mongolia's most ethnically diverse provinces, with at least 17 different nationalities and ethnicities represented[1][5][6]. This diversity is reflected in the linguistic landscape of the region. While Khalkha Mongolian is the dominant language, many of these ethnic groups maintain their own dialects, contributing to the rich linguistic tapestry of Khovd province[1][6].

The use of these languages varies across different districts (soums) of Khovd. For example, Kazakh is more prevalent in areas with higher Kazakh populations, while Oirat dialects are more common in their traditional ethnic areas[1][2].

It's also worth noting that many of these languages, particularly the Oirat dialects, are considered endangered due to the increasing dominance of Khalkha Mongolian and changing social and economic conditions[1][3]. Efforts are being made to document and preserve some of these dialects, such as the Uriankhai dialect[1].
