Approximately 20-30% of patients with Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS) require mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure[1][3][6]. This is a significant proportion of GBS cases and highlights the potential severity of the condition. Here are some key points about ventilation in GBS patients:

1. Frequency of ventilation:
- Up to 30% of GBS patients develop respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation[6].
- About 30% of GBS patients are admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and require invasive mechanical ventilation[2].

2. Predictors of ventilation need:
- Factors associated with a higher likelihood of needing ventilation include bulbar dysfunction, vital capacity <20 mL/kg, bilateral facial palsy, autonomic dysfunction, and rapid disease progression[7].
- Other predictors include upper limb paralysis, cranial nerve involvement, and rapidly progressive motor weakness[4].

3. Timing and urgency:
- Respiratory failure can develop rapidly in GBS patients. About 48% of intubations occurred between 6 PM and 8 AM, though most were semi-elective[7].
- Urgent "crash" intubations due to respiratory or cardiac arrest occurred in 16% of cases[7].

4. Outcomes:
- While mechanical ventilation is associated with increased complications and longer hospital stays, mortality rates may not differ significantly between ventilated and non-ventilated GBS patients with respiratory compromise when using conservative intubation criteria[9].
- Most ventilated GBS patients who survive eventually regain independent ambulation (79% in one study)[1].

5. Duration of ventilation:
- The median duration of mechanical ventilation in GBS patients can be around 21 days, with a wide range (1-88 days in one study)[9].

It's important to note that early recognition of respiratory decline and appropriate management can significantly impact outcomes for GBS patients. Close monitoring of respiratory function and timely intervention are crucial in managing these cases.
