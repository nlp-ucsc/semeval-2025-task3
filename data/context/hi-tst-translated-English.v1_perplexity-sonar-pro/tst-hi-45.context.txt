According to the search results, Moggallāna's Pali grammar, known as the Moggallānavyākaraṇa, contains 810 rules or aphorisms (sūtras)[5]. 

The text is comprised of six chapters called Kaṇḍas, and these 810 rules are accompanied by a commentary called Vutti[5]. This grammar represents an attempt by Moggallāna to start a new school of Pali grammar in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) in the 12th century CE[5].

Moggallāna composed this grammatical system around 1186 CE at the Thūpārāma Monastery[1][5]. It consists of three main parts:

1. The set of rules (Moggallānavyākaraṇa)
2. A paraphrase on those rules (Moggallānavutti)
3. An extensive commentary (Moggallānapañcikā)

This new grammatical system was considered a necessary outcome of the monastic reforms that had taken place in 1165 under King Parākramabāhu I[1]. Moggallāna's grammar was designed to be more systematic and comprehensive than earlier Pali grammars, particularly the Kaccāyana tradition that had been dominant in Sri Lanka up to that point[1][5].

It's worth noting that Moggallāna's grammar differs from earlier Pali grammatical texts in its style and structure. He adopted a similar means of grammatical description to the Sanskrit Cāndravyākaraṇa, using short aphorisms or sūtras connected by the principle of ellipsis (anuvṛtti)[1]. This style, while common in Sanskrit, was not widely used in Pali and Sinhala texts prior to the reform era[1].
