The historical County of Flanders is now split across three modern-day countries:

1. Belgium: The largest portion of the former County of Flanders is located in Belgium. It includes the Belgian provinces of West Flanders and East Flanders[6]. These two provinces form the core of what was historically the County of Flanders.

2. France: A part of the historical County of Flanders is now in France, specifically in the region known as French Flanders. This area is located in the modern-day Hauts-de-France region[6].

3. The Netherlands: A small part of the former County of Flanders is now part of the Netherlands. This area is known as Zeelandic Flanders (Zeeuws-Vlaanderen in Dutch) and is part of the Dutch province of Zeeland[6][8].

It's important to note that the boundaries of the historical County of Flanders do not precisely match modern political borders. The area has a complex history of changing rulers and shifting boundaries over the centuries. Today, while the term "Flanders" is most commonly associated with the northern region of Belgium, historically it encompassed a wider area that crossed what are now international borders[4][6].
