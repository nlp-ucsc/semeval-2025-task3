In England, Holy Thursday is commonly known as Maundy Thursday[1][2][3]. This name derives from the Latin word "mandatum," meaning "command," which refers to Jesus' commandment to his disciples to "love one another as I have loved you"[2][3].

The term "Maundy" has a specific significance in England due to the Royal Maundy ceremony. This is a religious service held on Maundy Thursday, during which the British monarch traditionally distributes special silver coins called "Maundy money" to elderly recipients as a symbolic act of almsgiving[5][8]. This tradition dates back to the 13th century and has evolved over time[6].

While Maundy Thursday is the most common alternative name in England, there are a few other less frequently used terms:

1. Sheer Thursday or Shere Thursday: These names mean "clean" or "bright" Thursday, possibly referring to the practice of cleaning the house in preparation for Easter or to the act of Jesus washing his disciples' feet[3].

2. Green Thursday: This is a direct translation of the German "Gr√ºndonnerstag," though it's not commonly used in England. The origin of this name is debated, but it may be related to the tradition of eating green vegetables on this day[3].

It's worth noting that while these alternative names exist, Maundy Thursday remains the most widely recognized and used term in England for the Thursday before Easter.
