The Emilia-Romagna region is divided into nine provinces[1][2][4][8]. These provinces are:

1. Metropolitan City of Bologna (formerly Bologna Province)
2. Ferrara Province
3. Forlì-Cesena Province
4. Modena Province
5. Parma Province
6. Piacenza Province
7. Ravenna Province
8. Reggio Emilia Province
9. Rimini Province

The Metropolitan City of Bologna is the largest province in Emilia-Romagna by population, territory, and number of comuni (municipalities)[1]. It's worth noting that in 2015, the system was slightly altered with the introduction of Metropolitan Cities, which is why Bologna is now referred to as the Metropolitan City of Bologna rather than Bologna Province[1].

Each of these provinces represents different geographical areas of the region and is typically named after its largest city[1]. The provinces are further divided into comuni (Italian plural for municipalities), with the total number of municipalities in Emilia-Romagna being 328 as of January 2019[10].

Emilia-Romagna covers a total area of 22,446 km² (8,666 sq mi), ranking sixth in Italy by size[8]. The region's geography is diverse, with nearly half consisting of plains (48%), while 27% is hilly and 25% mountainous[2][8].
