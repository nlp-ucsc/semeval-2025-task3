The Dakhma or 'Tower of Silence' is located in several places in India, with the most prominent ones being in Mumbai. Here are the key details about their locations:

1. Mumbai (formerly Bombay):
   The main Towers of Silence in India are situated in Mumbai, specifically on Malabar Hill[1][5]. This area contains:
   - A 54-acre forest known as the Doongerwadi[1][3]
   - Five circular structures serving as Towers of Silence[5]
   - The largest complex, with about three to four functional wells (Dokhmas) in the Tower of Silence[2]

2. Other Indian cities:
   Towers of Silence can also be found in various other locations across India, including[2]:
   - Bengaluru
   - Hyderabad
   - Pune
   - Several towns and cities in Gujarat

It's important to note that these structures are typically:
- Located in forested areas or gardens to provide privacy and seclusion[1][5]
- Situated on hills or elevated areas[6]
- Restricted access sites, with entry generally prohibited for non-Parsis[5][7]

In cities where Towers of Silence are not available, such as Delhi, Parsi communities have adapted their practices. In these locations, bodies are typically buried rather than placed in the towers[2].

The Towers of Silence serve a crucial role in Zoroastrian funerary practices, particularly for the Parsi community in India. However, their use has faced challenges in recent years due to the decline in vulture populations and urban development encroaching on these once-isolated areas[1][3][5].
