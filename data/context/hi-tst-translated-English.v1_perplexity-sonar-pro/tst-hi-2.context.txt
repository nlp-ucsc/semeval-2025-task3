Each of these Local Government Areas has its own administrative headquarters and local government council. The LGAs vary in population and size, with Katsina LGA being the most populous, having an estimated population of 568,600 as of 2022[1].

In addition to these 34 LGAs, it's worth noting that the Katsina State House of Assembly recently approved the creation of eight new districts across Katsina and Daura Emirates[2]. While these are not at the same administrative level as LGAs, they represent a further subdivision of the state for local administration purposes. The newly created districts are:

Under Katsina Emirate:
1. Dankama
2. Radda
3. Muduru
4. Dabai
5. Shargalle
6. Katsina

Under Daura Emirate:
1. ÆŠankum
2. Kawarin Kudi

This recent development shows that the state continues to evolve its administrative structure to enhance governance and bring administration closer to the people.
