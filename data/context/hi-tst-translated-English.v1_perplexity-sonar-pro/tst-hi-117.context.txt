Angel Di María currently plays for Benfica, a Portuguese club in the Primeira Liga[1][5][7][8]. He rejoined Benfica on July 6, 2023, signing a one-year contract after leaving Juventus[5]. This marks Di María's second stint with Benfica, as he previously played for the club from 2007 to 2010[8]. 

Since returning to Benfica, Di María has made a significant impact:

1. He scored on his second debut for the club in a 2-0 victory over Porto in the Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira on August 9, 2023[5].

2. In the 2024-2025 season, he has scored 7 goals in 23 appearances across all competitions for Benfica as of January 4, 2025[7].

3. He wears the number 11 jersey for Benfica[7][8].

Di María's contract with Benfica is set to run until 2025, as the club reportedly activated a one-year extension option in his contract[4]. This decision by Benfica may have affected potential plans for Di María to join Inter Miami in the near future, as there were speculations about him possibly reuniting with Lionel Messi in the MLS[4][9].
