Switzerland's federal system consists of 26 member states, known as cantons[1][2][5]. These 26 cantons form the Swiss Confederation and serve as the primary subdivisions of the country.

Each canton has its own constitution, parliament, government, and courts[3]. The cantons enjoy considerable autonomy within the federal structure, managing their own affairs in areas such as education, healthcare, cultural matters, and police services[1][3]. They also have the authority to levy their own cantonal taxes[3].

The 26 cantons are:

1. Aargau (AG)
2. Appenzell Ausserrhoden (AR)
3. Appenzell Innerrhoden (AI)
4. Basel-Landschaft (BL)
5. Basel-Stadt (BS)
6. Bern/Berne (BE)
7. Fribourg (FR)
8. Genève (GE)
9. Glarus (GL)
10. Grisons (GR)
11. Jura (JU)
12. Luzern (LU)
13. Neuchâtel (NE)
14. Nidwalden (NW)
15. Obwalden (OW)
16. St. Gallen (SG)
17. Schaffhausen (SH)
18. Schwyz (SZ)
19. Solothurn (SO)
20. Thurgau (TG)
21. Ticino (TI)
22. Uri (UR)
23. Valais/Wallis (VS)
24. Vaud (VD)
25. Zug (ZG)
26. Zürich (ZH)[2]

It's worth noting that six of these cantons (Appenzell Ausserrhoden, Appenzell Innerrhoden, Basel-Landschaft, Basel-Stadt, Nidwalden, and Obwalden) are sometimes referred to as "half-cantons" due to historical reasons. However, in the current federal constitution, they are considered full cantons with the same rights and obligations as the other 20, except that they only have one seat instead of two in the Council of States (the upper house of the Federal Assembly)[5][6].

This federal structure, with power shared between the federal government, cantons, and communes, is a fundamental aspect of Swiss governance and allows for a high degree of local autonomy and direct democracy[1][7].
