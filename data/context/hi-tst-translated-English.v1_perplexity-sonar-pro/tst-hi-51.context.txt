World Cancer Day was first observed on February 4, 2000, at the World Summit Against Cancer for the New Millennium in Paris[1][2][6]. This summit marked the establishment of World Cancer Day as an international awareness day.

The creation of World Cancer Day was formalized through the signing of the Paris Charter against Cancer. This charter was signed by the then General Director of UNESCO, Kōichirō Matsuura, and the French President Jacques Chirac[1]. The Paris Charter had several objectives, including:

1. Promoting cancer research
2. Improving cancer prevention efforts
3. Enhancing patient services
4. Raising awareness about cancer among the general public
5. Mobilizing the global community against cancer

Article 10 of the Paris Charter specifically established February 4 as World Cancer Day, ensuring that the objectives of the charter would remain in the hearts and minds of people worldwide[3].

Since its inception in 2000, World Cancer Day has grown into a significant global event. It is now led by the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC), the largest and oldest international cancer organization dedicated to reducing the global cancer burden[4]. The day serves as a platform to unite people, organizations, and governments worldwide in the fight against cancer, promoting awareness, education, and action to improve cancer prevention, detection, and treatment.
