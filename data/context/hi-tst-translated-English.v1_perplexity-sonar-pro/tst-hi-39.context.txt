The flag of Ukraine consists of 2 colors: blue and yellow[1][2][5]. 

Specifically, the flag features two equally sized horizontal bands - a blue band on top and a yellow band on the bottom[2]. This blue and yellow bicolor design was officially adopted as the national flag of Ukraine on January 28, 1992, shortly after Ukraine declared independence from the Soviet Union[5].

The colors are said to symbolize Ukraine's landscape:

- The blue represents the sky above Ukraine[3][5].
- The yellow represents the wheat fields that are abundant in Ukraine, reflecting the country's role as a major agricultural producer often called the "breadbasket of Europe"[3][5].

These colors have a long history in Ukrainian heraldry and national symbols, dating back to medieval times[5]. The specific blue and yellow horizontal bicolor design first appeared in 1848 during a wave of European revolutions[5]. It was later adopted by short-lived independent Ukrainian states in 1917-1920 before being banned under Soviet rule[2]. The blue and yellow flag re-emerged as a symbol of Ukrainian independence and national identity in the late 1980s and early 1990s as the Soviet Union was collapsing[3][5].

While there has been some historical variation in the exact shades used, the current official standard specifies a strong azure blue and a bright yellow[2]. The flag's simple yet striking color combination has become a powerful international symbol of Ukrainian sovereignty and resistance, especially since Russia's invasion in 2022[6][7].
