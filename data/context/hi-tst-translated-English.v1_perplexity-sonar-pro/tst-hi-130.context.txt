According to the research conducted on the Mbendjele BaYaka people, a hunter-gatherer society living in the Republic of Congo, children develop a strong sense of direction from a very early age[1][3].

Specifically, the studies found that:

1. By around age 6, Mbendjele BaYaka children already performed as accurately as adults in pointing tests when conducted close to their camp[1].

2. Children as young as 6 years old were able to point to out-of-sight targets with high precision, especially when the tests were conducted near their camp[3].

However, there are some important nuances to this development:

1. Children's performance improved significantly when the sun was clearly visible in the sky[1][3]. This suggests that young children rely more heavily on visual cues like the sun's position for orientation.

2. In more distant and less familiar areas, children's pointing accuracy increased substantially when the sun was visible, while their performance was less accurate on cloudy days[1][3].

3. Adults, on the other hand, performed accurately throughout their range regardless of weather conditions, indicating a more developed and internalized sense of direction[1].

It's worth noting that this early development of navigational skills is likely tied to the Mbendjele BaYaka's lifestyle and environment:

1. They live in flat lowland rainforests where orientation is challenging due to heavy vegetation and the absence of distant landmarks[1].

2. From a very early age, children in this society need to learn how to use environmental cues, such as the position of the sun, to navigate[1].

3. The development of these skills is crucial for their survival and daily activities, as both men and women travel long distances for foraging and hunting[3].

This research highlights the remarkable navigational abilities of hunter-gatherer societies and how these skills develop from a young age as an adaptation to their environment and lifestyle.
