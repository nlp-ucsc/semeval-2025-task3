Nastaliq calligraphy is primarily associated with Persian and Islamic cultures, but it is not the main method of calligraphy used in Islam as a whole. Rather, it is most commonly used for writing in Persian and other languages influenced by Persian culture. Here are the key points about Nastaliq's usage:

1. Persian Culture: Nastaliq was developed specifically for the Persian language and culture in the 14th century[1][2]. It became the primary calligraphic style for writing Persian poetry and literature[3].

2. Indo-Iranian Languages: Nastaliq is widely used for writing several Indo-Iranian languages, including Classical Persian, Kashmiri, Punjabi, and Urdu[1].

3. Islamic World: While Nastaliq is an Islamic calligraphic style, it is not the main method used for religious texts across the entire Islamic world. It is more commonly used in Persian-influenced Islamic regions[1][2].

4. Poetry and Literature: Nastaliq is most frequently employed for writing Persian poetry and other literary works, rather than religious texts[2][4].

5. Geographic Usage: It is commonly used in Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, and Xinjiang (China). Historically, it was also used in Iraq, Turkey, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan[1].

6. Ottoman Turkish Poetry: Nastaliq was often used for Ottoman Turkish poetry, though rarely for Arabic[1].

7. Quranic Texts: While there are some Qurans written in Nastaliq, this is relatively rare and considered unique[5].

In summary, while Nastaliq is an important Islamic calligraphic style, it is not the main method used across all of Islam. It is most closely associated with Persian culture and languages influenced by Persian, used primarily for poetry and literature rather than religious texts.
