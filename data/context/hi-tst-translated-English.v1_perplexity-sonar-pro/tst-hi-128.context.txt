I apologize, but I don't have enough information from the provided search results to determine when the term of Vietnam's seventh president ended. The search results don't contain specific details about Vietnam's seventh president or their term dates.

To accurately answer this question, we would need more specific historical information about Vietnam's presidential succession and term lengths. The search results primarily focus on more recent political events in Vietnam and some historical information about the Vietnam War era, but they don't provide a comprehensive list of Vietnamese presidents and their terms.

If you need this information, I would recommend searching for a detailed chronological list of Vietnamese presidents or consulting official Vietnamese government sources that might have this historical data. Without such information, I cannot provide an accurate answer to when the seventh president's term ended.
