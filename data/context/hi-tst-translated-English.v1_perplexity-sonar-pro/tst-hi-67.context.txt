Martin Luther is widely recognized as the primary figure who initiated the Protestant Reformation, a reform movement that came to be known as Protestantism[1][2][4]. 

Luther, a German monk and professor of theology, began the Reformation in 1517 when he posted his Ninety-Five Theses on the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany[1][7]. In these theses, Luther criticized various practices of the Roman Catholic Church, particularly the sale of indulgences. He argued that salvation could only be achieved through personal faith in Jesus Christ and God's grace, rather than through the practices promoted by the Catholic Church at the time[1][4].

While Luther was the initial catalyst, several other key figures contributed significantly to the spread and development of Protestantism:

1. John Calvin: A French theologian who became a leader in the second generation of the Reformation. His interpretation of Christianity, known as Calvinism, deeply influenced Protestant thought[1].

2. Huldrych Zwingli: A Swiss reformer who became the first to express a form of the Reformed tradition in 1519[3].

3. John Knox: An ardent disciple of Calvin who established Calvinistic Protestantism as the national religion of Scotland[2].

4. Philip Melanchthon: A close associate of Luther who helped spread the Reformation in Germany[3].

5. Martin Bucer: An influential reformer in Strasbourg who tried to mediate between Luther and Zwingli[3].

These reformers, along with many others, contributed to the rapid spread of Protestant ideas across Europe in the 16th century. The movement was aided by the advent of the printing press, which allowed for the quick dissemination of reformist writings[7]. As a result, Protestantism diversified into various denominations and became firmly established in many parts of Europe, fundamentally altering the religious landscape of the Western world[4][7].
