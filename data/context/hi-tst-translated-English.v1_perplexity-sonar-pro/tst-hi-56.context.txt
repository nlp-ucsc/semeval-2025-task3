The first modern Olympic Games started in Athens, Greece in 1896[1][5]. Specifically, the Games opened on April 6, 1896 (which was Easter Monday that year)[1][3]. This event marked the revival of the ancient Olympic tradition and the beginning of the modern Olympic era.

Some key details about these inaugural modern Olympics include:

1. Venue: The main venue was the Panathenaic Stadium, which was refurbished for the occasion and could hold up to 80,000 spectators[1][5].

2. Participation: 241 athletes (all male) from 14 nations competed in the games[1][5].

3. Events: There were 43 events across 9 sports disciplines[1].

4. Duration: The Games lasted for 9 days, from April 6 to April 15, 1896[1].

5. Opening: The Games were officially opened by King George I of Greece[1].

6. Closing: The closing ceremony was held on April 15, 1896, where King George awarded prizes to the winners[1].

These Athens Games of 1896 were a landmark event in sports history, reviving the Olympic tradition after a hiatus of over 1500 years since the ancient games were last held in 393 AD[4]. The success of these games laid the foundation for the quadrennial Olympic tradition that continues to this day.
