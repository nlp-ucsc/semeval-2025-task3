HMY Britannia served for 43 years, from 1954 to 1997[1][4]. 

The yacht was commissioned on January 11, 1954 and entered royal service that year[1][7]. It was decommissioned on December 11, 1997[1].

During its 43-year career, HMY Britannia:

- Traveled over 1 million nautical miles[1][4][7]
- Made more than 700 foreign visits and 272 visits in British waters[1]
- Called at over 600 ports in 135 countries[7]
