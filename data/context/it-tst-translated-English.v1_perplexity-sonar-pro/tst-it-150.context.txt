Based on the search results, two candidates who were initially approved to run in the 2013 Iranian presidential election withdrew their candidacies during the election campaign:

1. Mohammad Reza Aref - He withdrew his candidacy on June 11, 2013, three days before the election[4][6]. Aref was a reformist candidate who had previously served as First Vice President from 2001-2005 under President Mohammad Khatami[4]. He withdrew to boost support for the moderate candidate Hassan Rouhani[4][7].

2. Gholam-Ali Haddad-Adel - He withdrew his candidacy on June 10, 2013, four days before the election[4][6]. Haddad-Adel was considered a hardline conservative candidate and had previously served as Speaker of the Parliament from 2004-2008[4]. He withdrew in favor of other principlist (conservative) candidates[4].

Both of these candidates were among the eight initially approved by the Guardian Council to appear on the ballot[4]. Their withdrawals left six candidates in the race, though Hassan Rouhani ultimately won with over 50% of the vote in the first round[4].
