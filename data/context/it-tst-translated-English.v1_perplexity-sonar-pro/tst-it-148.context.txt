Sergei Parajanov's first film as a director was "Andriesh," released in 1954[1][2]. This marked the beginning of his career as a professional film director after graduating from the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography (VGIK) in 1951[1][3].

"Andriesh" was based on a Moldovan folktale and was produced at the Dovzhenko Film Studio in Kiev, where Parajanov began working after his graduation[1][10]. It's worth noting that Parajanov had worked on a student film called "Moldavian Tale" (also known as "Moldavskaya Skazka") in 1951, but this film was lost and is not considered his official directorial debut[2].

Parajanov's early works, including "Andriesh," were made in the socialist realism style that was prevalent in the Soviet Union at the time. However, he would later disown these early films, referring to them as "garbage," as he moved away from socialist realism and developed his unique cinematic style[6][8].
