The flowers of Aesculus hippocastanum, commonly known as horse chestnut, typically have 4 or 5 petals. The petals are predominantly white and are often spotted or blotched with yellow and red near the base[1][3][4][7].

Specifically:

1. The flowers are usually 1 to 1Â¼ inches across with 4 or 5 petals[1].

2. The petals are spreading and irregularly rounded[1].

3. The white petals have a distinctive red to pink or yellowish blotch towards the base[1][4].

4. As the flower matures, the color of the spots may change. Initially, there's often a yellow patch at the base of the petals. After pollination, this yellow spot typically turns to dark pink or red[3][7].

5. This color change from yellow to red after fertilization may serve as a signal to pollinating insects that the flower is no longer producing nectar[3].

The overall appearance of these flowers in their clustered arrangement on the tree has led to them being popularly referred to as "candles" in some regions, as they appear to "light up" the tree when in full bloom[6].
