Adolf Joseph Ferdinand Galland, the renowned German Luftwaffe general and flying ace of World War II, died on February 9, 1996, in Oberwinter, Germany, at the age of 83[6][7]. 

Galland's death was due to natural causes related to his advanced age. He had lived a long and eventful life after surviving numerous close calls during his military career. During World War II, Galland flew 705 combat missions and survived being shot down four times[4][7]. He was credited with 104 aerial victories, all against Western Allied aircraft[4][7].

After the war, Galland was briefly imprisoned but later released. He went on to serve as a technical adviser to the Argentine air force for six years before returning to West Germany, where he worked as an aviation consultant in DÃ¼sseldorf[6]. 

Throughout his post-war life, Galland remained a respected figure in aviation circles. He often lectured and wrote about his wartime experiences, providing valuable insights into aerial combat tactics and the history of the Luftwaffe. His longevity allowed him to bridge the gap between the World War II era and the modern age, serving as a living link to a pivotal period in aviation and military history.

Galland's passing marked the end of an era, as he was one of the last surviving high-ranking Luftwaffe officers from World War II. His death was mourned by aviation enthusiasts and historians worldwide, who recognized his significant contributions to aerial warfare and his complex legacy as both a skilled pilot and a figure in Nazi Germany's military.
