Frances Farmer died of esophageal cancer on August 1, 1970, at the age of 56[1][3]. She was diagnosed with the cancer in the spring of 1970, which was attributed to her lifelong habit of heavy smoking[1]. After the initial diagnosis, Farmer was hospitalized for three weeks before being sent home for a brief period[1]. She ultimately passed away at Indianapolis Community Hospital[1].

Farmer's battle with cancer came at the end of a tumultuous life marked by a promising Hollywood career in the 1930s, followed by struggles with mental health issues, institutionalization, and attempts at career comebacks. In the years leading up to her death, Farmer had been living a relatively quiet life in Indiana, where she had hosted a local TV show called "Frances Farmer Presents" from 1958 to 1964[5]. Her final film role was in the 1958 drama "The Party Crashers"[1].

After her death, Farmer was interred at Oaklawn Memorial Gardens Cemetery in Fishers, Indiana[1]. Her passing at a relatively young age marked the end of a life that had captured public attention for both her talent as an actress and the controversies surrounding her personal struggles.
