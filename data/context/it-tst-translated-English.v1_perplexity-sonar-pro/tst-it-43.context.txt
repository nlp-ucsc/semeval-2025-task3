José Mojica was the tenor who made María Grever's song "Júrame" popular[1][2][5]. 

In 1927, Mojica, who had become a star tenor of the Chicago Opera, recorded "Júrame"[2]. This recording helped establish María Grever's reputation internationally and brought both the composer and the singer widespread recognition[1]. The song, which is rumored to have been written about Maria's long absence from her husband, became Grever's first international hit[1][2].

"Júrame," which translates to "Promise Me" in English, is a habanera-bolero that Mojica interpreted masterfully[4][8]. The song's popularity was further boosted when Mojica sang it in the 1928 film "La leyenda del beso," making both Grever and Mojica world-renowned[2].

It's worth noting that while José Mojica was instrumental in popularizing "Júrame," the song has since been covered by many other renowned artists, including Juan Camacho, Nelson Ned, Julio Iglesias, Luis Miguel, Plácido Domingo, and Andrea Bocelli[5]. In 1964, operatic tenor Alfredo Kraus also recorded "Júrame" on his album "Siboney"[6].
