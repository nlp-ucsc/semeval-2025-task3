After graduating from the Technical High School in 1909, Erik Gunnar Asplund continued his studies at the Academy of Art in Stockholm[1][5]. This educational path provided Asplund with both technical and artistic training, which would prove influential in his architectural career.

Some additional details about Asplund's education:

1. He initially studied painting at the Royal Institute of Art in Stockholm in the early 20th century[4][9].

2. While at the Academy of Art, Asplund also attended the Stockholm Free Architecture School to further his architectural education[9].

3. After completing his formal studies, Asplund undertook an extensive study tour of Greece and Italy in 1913-1914, which had a profound impact on his architectural approach[5][6].

4. Later in his career, Asplund returned to academia as a professor of architecture at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm from 1931 until his death in 1940[1][3].

This combination of technical training, artistic education, and practical experience through travel helped shape Asplund into one of the most important Swedish architects of the 20th century, known for his transition from Nordic Classicism to modernist design.
