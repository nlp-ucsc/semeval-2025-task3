A retronym is a newer term created to distinguish the original or older version of something from a more recent version or variant. This linguistic phenomenon typically occurs when technological advancements or cultural changes necessitate a way to differentiate between the original concept and its newer counterparts[1][3].

Retronyms are formed by adding a modifying word (usually an adjective) to an existing term that previously stood alone. This modification helps to specify the original version of the item or concept that has evolved over time[5].

Some common examples of retronyms include:

1. Analog clock: Before digital clocks, all clocks were simply called "clocks"[3].
2. Acoustic guitar: This term became necessary after the invention of electric guitars[6].
3. Landline phone: This retronym emerged with the widespread adoption of mobile phones[1].
4. Snail mail: This term distinguishes traditional postal mail from email[3].
5. World War I: Originally known as "The Great War" until World War II occurred[3].

The term "retronym" itself was coined in 1980 by Frank Mankiewicz, who was the president of National Public Radio (NPR) at the time. It was later popularized by William Safire in his language column[3][5].

Retronyms are often created due to:

1. Technological advancements (e.g., "manual transmission" after automatic transmissions were invented)
2. Cultural changes (e.g., "dairy milk" to distinguish from plant-based milk alternatives)
3. Historical events (e.g., "The First World War" after World War II)

Understanding retronyms can provide insight into how language evolves to accommodate new concepts and technologies while preserving the ability to refer to original versions or forms[1][3][5].
