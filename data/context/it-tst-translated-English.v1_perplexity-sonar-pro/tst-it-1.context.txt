The term "French paradox" was coined by French epidemiologist Serge Renaud in the early 1990s[1][5]. Specifically:

1. Serge Renaud, a scientist from Bordeaux University, is considered the father of the phrase "French paradox"[5].

2. Renaud first presented his scientific study and data on the French paradox in 1991[5].

3. This was followed by a public documentary broadcast on the American CBS News television program "60 Minutes" in November 1991, which popularized the concept[1].

4. Renaud's landmark presentation of the French paradox was published in the medical journal The Lancet in 1992[1]. The article was titled "Wine, alcohol, platelets and the French paradox for coronary heart disease"[1].

While Renaud is credited with coining and popularizing the term in the early 1990s, it's worth noting that the observation itself was not entirely new:

- In 1981, three French researchers - Ducimeti√®re, Cambien, and Richard - had already used the term "French Paradox" after comparing levels of heart disease with fat intake data[4].

- The phenomenon had been observed even earlier. In 1819, an Irish cardiologist named Samuel Black had noted lower rates of heart-related deaths in France compared to Ireland[1].

However, it was Renaud's work and the subsequent media attention that truly brought the concept of the French paradox into public consciousness and scientific debate in the 1990s.
