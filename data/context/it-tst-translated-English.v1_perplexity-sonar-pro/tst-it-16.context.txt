Elias Koteas played the role of Captain James "Bugger" Staros in the 1998 film The Thin Red Line[1][4]. 

Koteas was part of an impressive ensemble cast in this Terrence Malick-directed war drama. The film featured many notable actors, including Sean Penn, Adrien Brody, Jim Caviezel, George Clooney, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Nick Nolte, John C. Reilly, and John Travolta, among others[1][4].

In the film, Captain Staros is the commander of C Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division[1]. His character plays a significant role in the narrative, particularly in a pivotal scene where he refuses to follow an order from Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Tall (played by Nick Nolte) to launch what Staros considers a suicidal frontal assault[1]. This decision leads to conflict between Staros and Tall, ultimately resulting in Staros being relieved of his command[1].

Koteas's performance as Staros was notable, with the character embodying the moral dilemmas and psychological toll of war. In one poignant quote from the film, Staros says to his men: "You are my sons, my dear sons. You live inside me now. I'll carry you wherever I go."[7]

The Thin Red Line, based on the novel by James Jones, was Malick's return to filmmaking after a 20-year hiatus. It received critical acclaim and was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director[1].
