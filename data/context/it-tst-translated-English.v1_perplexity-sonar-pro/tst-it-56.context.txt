Dissidia Final Fantasy was released in PAL territories on September 4, 2009[4][5]. This release date came approximately 10 days after the North American release[5].

The game was initially announced for release in Europe and other PAL territories in March 2009, with Square Enix stating it would launch in Autumn 2009[1][6]. At that time, John Yamamoto, president and CEO of Square Enix Ltd., commented on how the game would appeal to both Final Fantasy fans and newcomers alike due to its action-packed gameplay and large cast of characters from across the series[1].

Dissidia Final Fantasy is a fighting game that brings together heroes and villains from the first ten mainline Final Fantasy games[2]. It was originally released for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) system[2]. The game was part of Square Enix's celebration of over 20 years of the Final Fantasy franchise, offering fans a unique way to experience beloved characters in a new genre[1][8].

It's worth noting that this 2009 release was for the original Dissidia Final Fantasy. The franchise later saw additional entries, including a 2011 prequel (Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy) and a 2015 arcade version that was later ported to PlayStation 4 and PC as Dissidia Final Fantasy NT[3].
