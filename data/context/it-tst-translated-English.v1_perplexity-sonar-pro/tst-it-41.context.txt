Gu Bon-gil, the South Korean fencer, has won gold medals in the men's sabre team event at three consecutive Summer Olympics:

1. 2012 London Olympics: Gu won his first Olympic gold medal as part of the South Korean men's sabre team[1][3][6].

2. 2020 Tokyo Olympics: Gu secured his second Olympic gold medal in the team event[3][9]. (Note that these Games were held in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but are officially called the 2020 Olympics.)

3. 2024 Paris Olympics: Gu completed his hat-trick of Olympic gold medals in the men's sabre team event[1][2][4].

It's worth noting that Gu did not have the opportunity to compete in the team event at the 2016 Rio Olympics, as the men's sabre team event was not part of the program due to a now-abolished rotation policy[3]. However, he did participate in the individual event at those Games[9].

At 35 years old, Gu has announced that the 2024 Paris Olympics will be his last, making this third consecutive gold medal a fitting end to his Olympic career[1]. He is the only South Korean fencer with three team Olympic gold medals, cementing his legacy as one of the country's greatest fencers[1][3].
