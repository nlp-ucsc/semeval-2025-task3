I apologize, but I don't have specific information about the Italian voice actor for Sergeant Debbie Callahan in the 1984 film Police Academy. The search results provided do not contain details about the Italian dubbing cast for this movie.

To accurately answer this question, we would need to consult Italian dubbing records or credits for the film, which are not available in the given search results. The information about foreign language voice actors for specific characters in Hollywood films from the 1980s is often not readily available without specialized resources.

What I can tell you based on the search results is that Sergeant Debbie Callahan was played by Leslie Easterbrook in the original English-language version of Police Academy[1][5]. She was known for her physical appearance and aggressive character in the film series[2]. However, this information does not help identify her Italian voice actor.

If you need this specific information, it might be necessary to research Italian dubbing archives or contact Italian film distribution companies that were responsible for the movie's release in Italy.
