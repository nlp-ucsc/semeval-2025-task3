Felicity Jones played the role of Sienna Brooks in the film adaptation of Dan Brown's novel "Inferno"[1][2][4]. The film was directed by Ron Howard and released in 2016, with Tom Hanks reprising his role as Robert Langdon[1][2].

Sienna Brooks is a doctor who helps Robert Langdon escape and accompanies him on his quest to stop a deadly virus from being released. In the film, she is initially presented as an ally to Langdon but is later revealed to have a more complex role in the plot[1].

Felicity Jones is a British actress who has appeared in numerous films, including "The Theory of Everything" (for which she received an Academy Award nomination), "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story", and "On the Basis of Sex"[7]. Her casting in "Inferno" was announced on December 2, 2014[3].

It's worth noting that while Jones' portrayal of Sienna Brooks was faithful to the character's intelligence and problem-solving abilities, some critics felt that her performance in the film lacked the depth and complexity of the character as written in Brown's novel[6]. However, this may be more a reflection of the film's adaptation choices rather than Jones' acting abilities.
