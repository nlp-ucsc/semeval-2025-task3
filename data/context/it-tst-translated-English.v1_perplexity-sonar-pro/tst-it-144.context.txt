Line 8 of the Paris Metro crosses two significant bodies of water:

1. The Seine River: Line 8 crosses the Seine underground between the Concorde and Invalides stations[1][2]. This underwater crossing was constructed between April 1908 and January 1911, using a tunnel drilled with a circular tube and shield method rather than the originally planned vertical caisson approach[3].

2. The Marne River: Line 8 crosses the Marne River above ground via a viaduct between the Charenton – Écoles and École Vétérinaire de Maisons-Alfort stations[1][2][3]. This concrete viaduct, built in spring 1968, is 199 meters (653 ft) long and has six supports, including one pier in the river itself[3].

This makes Line 8 unique among Paris Metro lines, as it is the only line to cross both the Seine (the main river of Paris) and its principal tributary, the Marne[1][2][3]. The Seine crossing is underground, while the Marne crossing is aerial, providing passengers with a view of the river as they travel.

The line's route, which includes these river crossings, contributes to its status as one of the longest lines in the Paris Metro system, covering a distance of about 23.4 kilometers (14.5 miles)[3].
