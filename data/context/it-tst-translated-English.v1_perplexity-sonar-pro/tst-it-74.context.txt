Lil Dagover made her screen debut in a 1913 film directed by Louis Held[1][2]. This marked the beginning of her prolific career in German cinema, which would later include notable collaborations with prominent directors such as Fritz Lang and Robert Wiene[1][2].

While Louis Held directed her debut film, it's worth noting that Dagover's breakthrough role came a few years later in 1919, when she starred in Fritz Lang's exotic drama "Harakiri"[1][2]. This role significantly boosted her career and led to further collaborations with Lang and other influential directors of the German Expressionist movement[1][2].
