The movie "Tuck Everlasting" is adapted from the children's novel of the same name, "Tuck Everlasting," written by Natalie Babbitt and published in 1975[3][6]. This novel has become a classic of modern children's literature, selling over 5 million copies since its publication[3].

The story revolves around 10-year-old Winnie Foster, who discovers a family with the secret of immortality and must decide whether she wants to join them in living forever[3][4]. The novel explores themes of life, death, and the passage of time[5].

"Tuck Everlasting" has been adapted into various media formats:

1. Films:
   - A 1981 film adaptation by One Pass Media[1][3]
   - A more well-known 2002 Disney film adaptation directed by Jay Russell, starring Alexis Bledel as Winnie Foster and Jonathan Jackson as Jesse Tuck[1][3][7]

2. Audio books:
   - Three unabridged audio book versions have been produced[3]

3. Stage musical:
   - In 2015, the book was adapted into a musical by Casey Nicholaw, which debuted on Broadway in 2016[1][3]

The 2002 film adaptation, while generally faithful to the novel, made some changes, such as increasing Winnie's age from 10 to 15 and setting the story in 1914 instead of 1880[1]. Despite these changes, the film has been praised for capturing the themes and morals of the original book[7].

Natalie Babbitt, the author, has declined requests for a sequel or a television series based on the book, stating that the Tucks are only interesting in how their lives intersect with Winnie Foster's[5]. This underscores the importance of the original story and its themes in the various adaptations.
