Roger II of Sicily, the first King of Sicily, was born in Mileto, Calabria on December 22, 1095[1][5]. He was a highly significant historical figure who played a crucial role in shaping the political landscape of southern Italy and Sicily during the 12th century.

Roger II began his rule as Count of Sicily in 1105 at the young age of 9, following the death of his elder brother Simon[5]. He later became Duke of Apulia and Calabria in 1127, and finally ascended to the position of King of Sicily in 1130[1][5]. His coronation took place in Palermo on Christmas Day of that year[5].

Under Roger II's rule, the Kingdom of Sicily became a powerful and prosperous state. He was known for his administrative skills and his ability to unite diverse cultures within his realm. Roger II implemented important legal reforms, including the Assizes of Ariano, which aimed to establish a coherent state in southern Italy[5].

Roger II's reign was marked by significant expansion and consolidation of power. He successfully defended his territories against papal opposition and managed to gain recognition for his royal title from Pope Innocent II in 1139[5]. His kingdom eventually encompassed not only Sicily but also southern Italy, forming the basis for what would become the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily for the next seven centuries[5].

Roger II died in Palermo on February 26, 1154, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most influential rulers in the history of southern Italy and Sicily[5].
