The common murre (Uria aalge) has five recognized subspecies[1]. They are:

1. U. a. aalge (Pontoppidan, 1763) - Found in coastal southeast Canada, southwest Greenland, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Scotland, south Norway and Baltic Sea.

2. U. a. hyperborea Salomonsen, 1932 - Ranges from coastal north Norway to Svalbard and Novaya Zemlya (northwest Russia).

3. U. a. albionis Witherby, 1923 - Inhabits coastal British Isles, Heligoland (north of Germany), northwest France and west Iberian Peninsula.

4. U. a. inornata Salomonsen, 1932 - Found in coastal Kamchatka Peninsula, Sakhalin, Kuril and Commander Islands (east Russia), south Kuril Islands (north Japan), Teuri Island (northwest of Hokkaido; formerly also Hokkaido; north Japan); Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea islands to west Alaska and southwest Canada.

5. U. a. californica (Bryant, H, 1861) - Ranges from coastal north Washington to south California (east North Pacific).

These subspecies are differentiated based on their geographical distribution and slight variations in physical characteristics[1]. It's worth noting that some earlier classifications included additional subspecies such as intermedia and spiloptera, but these are now considered part of U. a. aalge in the current taxonomic arrangement.
