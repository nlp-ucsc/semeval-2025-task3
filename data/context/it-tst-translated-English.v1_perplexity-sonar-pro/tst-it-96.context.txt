There are three main types of language disorders:

1. Receptive language disorder: This type affects a person's ability to understand language. Individuals with receptive language disorder have difficulty comprehending words they hear or read, as well as understanding what others are saying[1][2][3]. They may struggle with following directions, understanding questions, and grasping new concepts[3].

2. Expressive language disorder: This type affects a person's ability to use language to communicate. Individuals with expressive language disorder have trouble getting their message across when they talk[1][2][3]. They often struggle to put words together into sentences that make sense, may use vague words, or use words incorrectly[2]. They may also have difficulty using correct grammar, asking and answering questions, and expressing their thoughts and feelings[3].

3. Mixed receptive-expressive language disorder: This type involves difficulties with both understanding and using language[1][2][5]. Individuals with this disorder struggle with comprehending what others say as well as expressing themselves effectively.

These language disorders can affect various aspects of language, including:

- Phonology (speech sounds and patterns)
- Morphology (word formation)
- Syntax (sentence structure)
- Semantics (word meanings)
- Pragmatics (language use in different contexts)[4]

It's important to note that language disorders are distinct from speech disorders, which specifically affect the production of speech sounds[5]. Language disorders can impact spoken, written, and even sign language[5]. They often start in early childhood and can persist into adulthood, affecting various aspects of a person's life, including social interactions, academic performance, and daily communication[2][3].
