Based on the available information, I cannot definitively state which administrative community the municipality of Pferdingsleben belongs to. The search results do not provide specific information about Pferdingsleben's administrative community.

However, I can provide some relevant context about Pferdingsleben and the administrative structure in Germany:

Pferdingsleben is a municipality located in the district of Gotha in the state of Thuringia, Germany[9]. In Germany, smaller municipalities like Pferdingsleben are often part of larger administrative communities (Verwaltungsgemeinschaften) to pool resources for administrative tasks[4].

The district of Gotha (Landkreis Gotha) is a rural district (Kreis) in western central Thuringia[3]. Rural districts in Germany typically contain multiple municipalities and can be further organized into administrative communities[1][2].

While we don't have specific information about Pferdingsleben's administrative community, it's likely that it belongs to one, given its small size and location within the Gotha district. Administrative communities in Germany are formed to help smaller municipalities handle administrative tasks more efficiently by sharing resources[4][6].

To determine the exact administrative community Pferdingsleben belongs to, one would need to consult local government sources or official records from the Gotha district or Thuringia state administration. This information is not provided in the given search results.
