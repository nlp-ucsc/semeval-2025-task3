The convent of Sant'Isidoro a Capo le Case in Rome has two notable cloisters:

1. The Wadding Cloister: This is the main and larger cloister, named after Luke Wadding, an Irish Franciscan friar who played a key role in the convent's history. It was built in 1630 and is located to the north-west of the church[1][5]. The Wadding Cloister features:

   - Arcades on all four sides
   - Fresco cycles in the walkways, painted by Fra Giovanni Antonio Sguary, a Franciscan artist
   - Portraits of forty-nine Franciscan saints
   - Thirty lunettes depicting scenes from the life of St. Francis

2. The Spanish Cloister: This is a smaller cloister, built for the original Spanish friars who founded the convent[5]. It is characterized by:

   - Its notably small size, possibly the smallest convent cloister in Rome
   - An old well in its center
   - Modern paintings in the cloister walks, including depictions of the Crucifix of San Damiano and St. Francis Receiving the Stigmata
   - Older anonymous works featuring Our Lady of Sorrows and The Resurrected Christ

These cloisters are integral parts of the convent complex, which has remained largely unaltered since its original construction in the 17th century, making it an important example of a well-preserved convent from that period[5].
