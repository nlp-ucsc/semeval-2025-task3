Nimravids were most widespread during the Oligocene epoch, which lasted from about 33.9 to 23 million years ago. Here are the key details:

The nimravids first appeared in the fossil record during the late Eocene epoch, around 40 million years ago[1][5]. However, they reached their peak diversity and geographic range during the subsequent Oligocene epoch:

- Nimravid fossils from the Oligocene have been found across North America and Eurasia[1][3].

- The global climate during the Oligocene was cooler and drier compared to the earlier Eocene, with more open woodlands and scrublands. Nimravids seem to have thrived in these environments as ambush predators[3].

- Out of the known nimravid genera, the majority are found in Oligocene-aged deposits[3].

- Researchers note that nimravids "flourished" and remained one of the dominant predator groups across Eurasia and North America throughout the Oligocene[3].

By the early Miocene (starting around 23 million years ago), nimravid diversity began to decline:

- Only 3 out of 9 established nimravid genera are known from Miocene-aged fossils[3]. 

- Two genera (*Dinictis* and *Nimravus*) only persisted into the earliest Miocene stage[3].

- The last known nimravid fossils date to around 9 million years ago in the late Miocene[1][3].

So while nimravids had a long evolutionary history spanning from the late Eocene to late Miocene, their period of greatest abundance and diversity was during the Oligocene epoch. Their decline in the Miocene coincided with ongoing climate change toward more open grasslands and the rise of other predator groups like amphicyonids ("bear-dogs")[3][4].
