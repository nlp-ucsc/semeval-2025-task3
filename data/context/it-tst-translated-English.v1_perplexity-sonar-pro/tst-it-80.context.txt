Theano, the ancient Greek philosopher associated with the Pythagorean school, is reported to have had several children. Based on the search results, the most commonly mentioned children of Theano and Pythagoras are:

1. Daughters:
   - Damo
   - Myia (also spelled Myria or Myra)
   - Arignote (also spelled Arignotis)

2. Sons:
   - Telauges (also spelled Teleuges)
   - Mnesarchus (also spelled Mnesarkhos)

Some sources mention five children in total[1][2][4], while others specify three daughters and two sons[5][8]. The Suda, an ancient encyclopedia, specifically names four children: Telauges, Mnesarkhos, Myia, and Arignote[10].

It's worth noting that there are some inconsistencies in the historical accounts regarding the exact number and names of Theano's children. This variability in the sources could be due to the significant time that has passed since Theano's era (6th century BCE) and the potential conflation of different historical figures named Theano[6].

Several sources highlight the involvement of Theano's children, particularly her daughters, in continuing the Pythagorean school of thought after Pythagoras's death[1][2][5]. Damo, for instance, is specifically mentioned as being responsible for safeguarding her father's writings[5].
