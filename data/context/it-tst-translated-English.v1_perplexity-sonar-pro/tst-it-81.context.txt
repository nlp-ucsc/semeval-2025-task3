Herman Frazier, the American sprinter, did not win any silver medals in his Olympic career[1][2][5][6]. His Olympic medal achievements include:

1. Gold medal in the 4x400 meters relay at the 1976 Montreal Olympics[1][2][5][6].
2. Bronze medal in the individual 400 meters event at the 1976 Montreal Olympics[1][2][5][6].

It's important to note that Frazier had a successful athletic career beyond just Olympic medals. He was an eight-time All-American in track at Arizona State University[2], and he also won gold medals in the 4x400 meters relay at the Pan American Games in both 1975 and 1979[1][4].

After his competitive career, Frazier went on to have a distinguished career in sports administration, including serving as the U.S. Olympic Committee vice president from 1996 to 2004 and as Chef de Mission for the U.S. delegation at the 2004 Athens Olympics[2].
