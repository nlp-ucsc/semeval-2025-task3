Liangshan County is administered by the prefecture-level city of Jining in Shandong province, China[4]. It is situated in the southwest of Shandong province, bordering the prefecture-level cities of Tai'an to the east and Heze to the west[4]. The Yellow River separates Liangshan County from Puyang in Henan province to the north[4].

As of 2012, Liangshan County was divided into 9 towns and 4 townships[4]. More recent information from 2024 indicates the county consists of 13 towns, one provincial economic development zone, one scenic spot, and 672 villages[5].

It's important to note that this Liangshan County in Shandong province should not be confused with the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan province, which is a different administrative division[1][7].
