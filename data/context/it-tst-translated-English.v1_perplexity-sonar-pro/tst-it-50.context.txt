VinFast's first electric scooter, named Klara, was introduced on November 3, 2018 and used batteries from two sources:

1. A lithium-ion battery version[1]
2. A lead battery version[1]

For the lithium-ion battery version, VinFast partnered with LG Chem to produce these batteries. On April 5, 2019, VinFast and LG Chem officially announced the establishment of a joint venture company for battery pack production[1][6][7]. This joint venture aimed to produce lithium-ion battery packs for VinFast's electric scooters that were already being made at that time, as well as for future electric cars[1][6].

The joint venture factory was set up in VinFast's Supplier Park in the northern port city of Hải Phòng, Vietnam[1]. In this partnership:

- VinFast was responsible for building warehouses and production lines, employing human resources, and operating the plant[1][7].
- LG Chem provided technical consultancy for the warehouses and equipment, supervised operations, trained workers, and transferred technologies and designs[1][7].

This collaboration was an important step for VinFast to increase the localization rate in its electric vehicles and contribute to the development of the support industry in Vietnam[1]. The partnership aimed to provide premium products meeting international standards and environmentally-friendly criteria[1].

It's worth noting that while this joint venture was announced after the introduction of the Klara scooter, it's likely that LG Chem was already supplying batteries to VinFast for its initial production, with the joint venture formalizing and expanding this relationship.
