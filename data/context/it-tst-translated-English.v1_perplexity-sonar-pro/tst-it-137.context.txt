The nominees for the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1989 (for films released in 1988) were:

1. Daniel Auteuil for "Jean de Florette"[2]

2. John Thaw for "Cry Freedom"[2]

3. Ian Bannen for "Hope and Glory"[2]

4. Michael Palin for "A Fish Called Wanda"[8]

5. Peter O'Toole for "The Last Emperor"[8]

Daniel Auteuil ultimately won the award for his performance in "Jean de Florette"[2]. This was a strong year for supporting actor performances, with nominees representing a mix of dramatic and comedic roles across various genres of film.

It's worth noting that the BAFTA Awards typically honor films released in the previous year, so these nominations were for performances in films from 1988, even though the ceremony was held in 1989. The BAFTAs are one of the most prestigious film awards outside of the Academy Awards, and often provide insight into potential Oscar contenders, especially for British and European films.
