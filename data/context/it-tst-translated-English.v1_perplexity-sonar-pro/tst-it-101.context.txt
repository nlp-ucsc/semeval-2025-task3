The Eshkol Tower at the University of Haifa has 30 floors[1][2]. This iconic skyscraper, completed in 1978, rises to a height of 102 meters (335 feet)[1][2]. The tower is a prominent landmark on the Haifa skyline and serves as the main building for the University of Haifa.

Some key details about the Eshkol Tower:

1. Location: It is situated on Mount Carmel, with its top reaching about 600 meters above sea level[1].

2. Design: The tower was initially conceptualized by renowned Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, though the final design and construction were completed by Israeli architect Shlomo Gilad[1].

3. Usage: The tower houses university offices, including rooms for teaching staff[1].

4. Observation deck: There is an observation area on the 30th floor, accessible by elevator, offering exceptional views of Haifa and the surrounding areas[3][4].

5. Structure: The tower is notably narrow, measuring only 13 meters in width, which can lead to significant swaying at the upper levels during strong winds[1].

6. Historical significance: It was the tallest building in Haifa until 2002 when it was surpassed by the Sail Tower[1].

The Eshkol Tower remains an integral part of the University of Haifa's campus and continues to be a distinctive feature of the city's architecture.
