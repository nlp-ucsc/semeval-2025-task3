During Chuseok, villagers dress up as cows and turtles when going house to house with pungmul performers[1][6]. This folk performance is known as Sonori, where village folk dress themselves to resemble a cow or turtle and go from house to house accompanied by a nongak band playing pungmul music[1].

Specifically, there are two main variations of this custom:

1. Geobugi noli (거북이놀이) - The turtle dance/game:
   - Turtle costumes are made from millet stalks
   - Usually two people get inside the turtle's top shell
   - They walk from home to home with a turtle leader and pungmul musicians[3]

2. Sonoli (소놀이) - The cow game:
   - Similar to geobugi noli, but with a cow costume instead
   - Two people are inside the cow costume
   - They are also accompanied by pungmul performers[3]

In both cases, the costumed performers and musicians visit homes in the village. The head of each house is expected to invite the group inside to play and dance. The performers wish for the long life and prosperity of the family, and in return, the household provides food and drinks for the performers[3].

These traditions, while rooted in agricultural communities, serve as a way to bring people together, celebrate the harvest, and share in the festive spirit of Chuseok. Although many of these practices are now mainly seen in re-enactments or cultural demonstrations, they remain an important part of Korea's cultural heritage and are often showcased during Chuseok celebrations[3][6].
