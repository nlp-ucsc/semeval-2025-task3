I apologize, but I do not have any information from the Nordic Family Book (Nordisk familjebok) about the specific location of Jomsborg. The search results provided do not contain any details from this particular encyclopedia regarding Jomsborg's location.

However, based on the available information from other sources, I can provide some context about the debated location of Jomsborg:

Jomsborg was a semi-legendary Viking stronghold whose exact location remains uncertain[3]. It is generally believed to have been situated on the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, in the area of medieval Wendland (modern Pomerania)[3]. Many historians and archaeologists have speculated about its precise location, but no definitive consensus has been reached.

Some of the proposed locations include:

1. The island of Wolin in northwestern Poland, particularly near the present-day town of Wolin. This is considered by many to be the most likely location[3][4].

2. The northwestern part of Usedom island, possibly on now-submerged lands[3].

3. The area between the small islands of Ruden and Greifswalder Oie[3].

4. The Peenem√ºnde shoals[3].

It's important to note that while archaeological evidence has been found in some of these areas, the existence of Jomsborg as described in the sagas has not been conclusively proven. Some historians, like Lauritz Weibull, have even dismissed Jomsborg as purely legendary[3].

Recent excavations near Wolin have uncovered evidence that might support the existence of a Viking settlement in the area, but whether this was actually Jomsborg remains a subject of ongoing research and debate[6].
