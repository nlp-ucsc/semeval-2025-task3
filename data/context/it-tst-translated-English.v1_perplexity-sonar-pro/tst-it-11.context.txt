Isolobodon portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican hutia, is an extinct species of rodent that belonged to the family Capromyidae[1][4]. This species was native to the Caribbean region, specifically found on the island of Hispaniola (which today comprises the Dominican Republic and Haiti) and Gonâve Island[1]. It was later introduced to the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico[1].

Key characteristics of Isolobodon portoricensis include:

1. Taxonomy: 
   - Kingdom: Animalia
   - Phylum: Chordata
   - Class: Mammalia
   - Order: Rodentia
   - Family: Capromyidae (though some sources list it under Echimyidae)
   - Genus: Isolobodon
   - Species: I. portoricensis[1][4]

2. Historical significance: The Puerto Rican hutia was an important food source for the indigenous Taíno people[1]. It continued to survive until the arrival of European explorers, with Christopher Columbus and his crew believed to have consumed this species upon their arrival in the Caribbean[1].

3. Extinction: The species declined following European colonization of the West Indies[1]. While the exact date of extinction is unclear, it is believed to have faced significant threats from:
   - The introduction of black rats (Rattus rattus) by early European settlers around 1500
   - The introduction of small Indian mongooses (Urva auropunctata) in the 19th or early 20th century[1]

4. Conservation status: Isolobodon portoricensis is currently classified as extinct[2]. However, some researchers maintain hope that the species might still survive in undisturbed refuges[1].

5. Scientific discovery: The species was first described scientifically by Joel Asaph Allen in 1916[1][4].

6. Habitat: As a hutia, it was likely adapted to a variety of habitats on the Caribbean islands where it was found[5].

While Isolobodon portoricensis is no longer extant, its study contributes to our understanding of Caribbean biodiversity, the impact of human colonization on island ecosystems, and the importance of conservation efforts for unique island species.
