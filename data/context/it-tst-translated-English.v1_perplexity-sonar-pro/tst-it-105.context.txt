Several reptile species are present in Garajonay National Park on the island of La Gomera in the Canary Islands. The main reptile species found in the park include:

1. Gomeran lizard (Gallotia gomerana or Gallotia caesaris gomerae): This is an endemic lizard species found on La Gomera[1][4]. It's a subspecies of Boettger's Lizard that is specific to the island.

2. Gomeran skink (Chalcides coeruleopunctatus): This is another endemic reptile species found in the park[1][4]. It's a recently recognized species of skink specific to La Gomera.

3. Stripeless tree frog (Hyla meridionalis): While technically an amphibian rather than a reptile, this species is also found in Garajonay National Park[1][4].

4. La Gomera giant lizard (Gallotia bravoana): This critically endangered species is one of the rarest reptiles in the world. While not typically found within the park itself, it inhabits nearby cliffs and is an important part of La Gomera's endemic fauna[2][3]. It was rediscovered in 1999 after being thought extinct, with only about 20 individuals found in a small area of the island[5].

5. Boettger's Wall Gecko (Tarentola gomerensis): This gecko species is endemic to La Gomera and can be found in the park and surrounding areas[5].

It's worth noting that the park and the island of La Gomera as a whole are known for their high level of endemism in flora and fauna. Many of these reptile species are unique to the Canary Islands or even to La Gomera itself, making them of particular interest for conservation efforts[1][2][3]. The park provides important habitat for these species, especially given the limited range of many endemic Canarian reptiles.
