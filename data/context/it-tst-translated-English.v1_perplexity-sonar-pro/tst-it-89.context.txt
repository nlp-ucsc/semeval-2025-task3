I apologize, but I do not have enough accurate information to determine which specific canton the French commune of Labalme is located in. The search results do not provide clear details about Labalme's cantonal affiliation. 

There are a few key points to note:

1. Labalme is a commune in France, but there are actually two distinct communes with this name:

   - Labalme in the Ain department in eastern France[3]
   - La Balme in the Savoie department in southeastern France[1][7]

2. Communes in France are typically grouped into cantons for administrative purposes, but the exact canton for either of these Labalme communes is not specified in the given search results.

3. The administrative divisions of France include regions, departments, cantons, and communes, with cantons being subdivisions of departments[2]. However, the specific canton for Labalme is not mentioned.

4. Without more precise local administrative information, I cannot confidently state which canton either Labalme commune belongs to.

To determine the correct canton, we would need more detailed local administrative records or official government sources specific to the area where Labalme is located. If you could specify which Labalme you're referring to (in Ain or in Savoie), that might help narrow down the search, but additional research would still be needed to identify the exact canton.
