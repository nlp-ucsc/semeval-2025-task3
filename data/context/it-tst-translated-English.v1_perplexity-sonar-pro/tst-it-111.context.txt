In chapter 8 of the video game F.E.A.R., the protagonist has a vision of Alma[1]. Alma is a key character in the game's storyline - she is a powerful psychic girl who appears as ghostly visions to the player character throughout the game[1]. These visions of Alma are often unsettling and contribute to the game's horror atmosphere. While the search results don't explicitly mention a vision in chapter 8, Alma's appearances are a recurring element in F.E.A.R., and she is likely the subject of any significant vision the protagonist experiences.
