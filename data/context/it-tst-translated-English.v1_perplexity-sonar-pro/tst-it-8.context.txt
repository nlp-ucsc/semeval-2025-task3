I apologize, but I don't have any information about which film distribution company in Italy released the movie "Hit Man - Killer by Chance". The search results provided do not contain any details about Italian distribution for this film. 

The search results mainly focus on the 2023 American film "Hit Man" directed by Richard Linklater and starring Glen Powell. This film was distributed by Netflix in the United States[1][4], but there's no mention of its Italian distribution. 

If you're looking for information about a different film with a similar title, or if you need details about international distribution for the 2023 "Hit Man", I would need more specific information or additional search results to provide an accurate answer.
