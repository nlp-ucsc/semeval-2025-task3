According to Greek mythology, Ares was freed from captivity by Hermes after being imprisoned by the Aloadae giants[2][3][4].

The story goes that the twin giants Otus and Ephialtes, known as the Aloadae, managed to capture Ares during their attempt to overthrow the Olympian gods. They imprisoned Ares in a bronze jar (or cauldron in some versions) for 13 months[1][2][4].

The situation was resolved when Eriboea, the stepmother of the Aloadae, informed Hermes about Ares' captivity[2][4]. Upon learning this information, Hermes, who was known for his cunning and stealth, went to rescue Ares. He successfully freed the god of war from his confinement[2][3][4].

Some versions of the myth provide additional details:

1. Homer's account in the Iliad mentions that Ares was growing faint and the hard bondage was breaking him when Hermes came to his rescue[2].

2. In some tellings, it's said that no one on Olympus particularly cared about Ares' disappearance until the situation became threatening to the gods' rule[4].

3. An alternative version suggests that Artemis was involved in Ares' release, though this is less commonly cited[7].

Ultimately, the most widely accepted version of the myth credits Hermes with freeing Ares from his imprisonment by the Aloadae giants.
