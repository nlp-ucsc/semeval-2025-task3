The coat of arms of the Pontifical Gregorian University features the following elements:

A shield divided into two halves[1][5]:

1. The upper half contains a dragon, which is likely a reference to Pope Gregory XIII, the university's founder and namesake. The dragon was part of Pope Gregory XIII's personal coat of arms.

2. The lower half depicts an open book, symbolizing learning and scholarship.

Above the shield is a papal tiara (the triple crown worn by popes) with keys crossed behind it, representing papal authority[1][5].

The coat of arms uses the colors bordeaux (a deep red) and gray, which are the official colors of the university[8].

This heraldic design combines symbols representing the university's papal origins, its dedication to scholarship, and its status as a pontifical institution. The dragon connects it specifically to Pope Gregory XIII, while the book, papal tiara, and keys emphasize its role as a center of Catholic learning directly associated with the Holy See.
