Until 1677, Omega Centauri was classified as a single star[1][5][6]. This classification dates back to ancient times, with the Greek astronomer Ptolemy cataloging it as a star in his Almagest around 150 AD[1][4]. Ptolemy described it as a star on the centaur's back, specifically noting it as "Quae est in principio scapulae"[1][4].

This stellar classification persisted for centuries. In 1603, German cartographer Johann Bayer used Ptolemy's data to designate this object as "Omega Centauri" in his star atlas Uranometria[1][4]. Bayer assigned Greek letter designations to stars based on their apparent brightness, and since Omega Centauri appeared as a dim star to the naked eye, it was given the designation "Omega"[4].

It wasn't until 1677 that the classification of Omega Centauri began to change. English astronomer Edmond Halley, observing from the island of Saint Helena, was the first to recognize it as a non-stellar object[1][2][3]. Halley noted its fuzzy appearance through his telescope and cataloged it as a nebula[2][6]. This observation marked the beginning of a new understanding of Omega Centauri, leading to further investigations and reclassifications in the centuries that followed.
