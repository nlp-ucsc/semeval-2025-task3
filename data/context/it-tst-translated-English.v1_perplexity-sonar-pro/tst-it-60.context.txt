The tuned mass damper in the 111 West 57th Street tower weighs approximately 800 tons (726 metric tons)[1][2][3]. This massive damper is installed at the top of the building to provide stability against high winds and earthquakes[2].

Some key details about the damper:

- It is one of the heaviest tuned mass dampers in the world, surpassing the 730-ton damper in Taipei 101[1].

- Its weight is equivalent to over 3.5 Statues of Liberty[1][3].

- The damper consists of tuned steel plates[2].

- It is located in an upper mechanical penthouse of the building[4].

- The damper was designed by RWDI, a specialized engineering firm[4].

This extremely heavy damper is crucial for stabilizing such a slender skyscraper. With a height-to-width ratio of 24:1, 111 West 57th Street is considered the most slender building in the world[4][6]. The damper helps reduce wind-induced sway and improve occupant comfort in this uniquely thin 1,428-foot (435-meter) tall structure[5][6].
