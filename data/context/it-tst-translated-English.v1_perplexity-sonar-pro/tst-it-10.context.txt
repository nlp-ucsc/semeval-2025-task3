According to legend, the city of Monterchi was founded by Hercules himself after defeating the Hydra[1][3]. The name Monterchi is believed to derive from the Latin "Mons Herculis," meaning "Mount of Hercules," which likely refers to an ancient temple dedicated to the god Hercules that was present in the area during Etruscan times[1]. 

This mythical origin is still reflected in the town's coat of arms, which depicts Hercules slaying the Hydra, a multi-headed serpentine monster from Greek and Roman mythology[3][5]. The legend states that after vanquishing this fearsome creature, Hercules founded the town on the hill where it now stands.

This connection between Monterchi and Hercules is deeply ingrained in the town's identity and history. It represents a fascinating blend of classical mythology and local folklore, tying the small Tuscan town to the grand narratives of ancient Greece and Rome. The story of Hercules founding Monterchi after his victory over the Hydra symbolically links the town to themes of strength, heroism, and triumph over adversity.
