Magnar Solberg, the Norwegian biathlete, has won a total of 8 medals between the Olympics and World Championships. Here's a breakdown of his medal count:

Olympic Games medals (3 total):
- 2 Gold medals in the 20 km individual event (1968 Grenoble and 1972 Sapporo)[1][2]
- 1 Silver medal in the 4 Ã— 7.5 km relay (1968 Grenoble)[1][2]

World Championships medals (5 total):
- 3 Silver medals in the biathlon relay (1969, 1970, and 1971)[5]
- 2 Bronze medals in the individual event (1969 and 1971)[5]

Solberg's Olympic performances were particularly notable. He was the first biathlete to successfully defend an Olympic gold medal in the individual event, winning in both 1968 and 1972[1][2]. This achievement is even more impressive considering that he remains the only biathlete in Olympic history to win the 20 km event twice, which was the original Olympic biathlon event[1].

At the 1968 Grenoble Olympics, Solberg, then a 31-year-old policeman, surprised the biathlon world by winning the gold medal in the 20 km race with a perfect shooting score - something he had never achieved before[2]. Four years later, at the 1972 Sapporo Games, despite missing two shots, he still managed to ski fast enough to secure another victory[2].

It's worth noting that Solberg's success at the World Championships, while significant, was not as pronounced as his Olympic triumphs. His World Championship medals were primarily in team events, with three silver medals in the relay, complemented by two individual bronze medals[5].
