El Al Flight 402 was shot down by two Bulgarian MiG-15 jet fighters[1][2]. The incident occurred on July 27, 1955, when the El Al Lockheed Constellation aircraft, flying from London to Tel Aviv via Vienna and Istanbul, strayed into Bulgarian airspace[1][2]. 

The Bulgarian air force detected the airspace violation and dispatched two MiG-15 jets from the Dobroslavtsi airfield to intercept the intruder[5]. As the civilian plane approached Bulgaria's southern border and was about to cross into Greek airspace, the MiGs opened fire[5]. The Constellation exploded at an altitude of 2,000 feet, with its remains falling to earth near Petrich, Bulgaria[5].

The attack resulted in the deaths of all 58 people on board, including 51 passengers and 7 crew members[1][5]. This tragic incident became one of the most controversial events in Bulgarian aviation history, raising questions about international airspace protocols and the use of force against civilian aircraft[6].
