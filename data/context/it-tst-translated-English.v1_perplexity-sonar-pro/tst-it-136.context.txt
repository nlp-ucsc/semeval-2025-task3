The fragment of a Travers beaked whale's jaw was found on Pitt Island in the Chatham Islands of New Zealand in 1872[1][2]. 

This discovery was made by naturalist Henry Travers, who collected a lower jaw with teeth on Pitt Island. The specimen was initially reported in 1873 by James Hector, the director of the Colonial Museum in New Zealand, who mistakenly identified it as belonging to a strap-toothed whale. However, in 1874, British zoologist John Edward Gray examined the specimen and suggested it likely represented a new species, which he provisionally named Dolichodon traversii in honor of Henry Travers, the collector[1][2].

This jawbone fragment, along with the teeth, became the first physical evidence of the species now known as the spade-toothed whale (Mesoplodon traversii). For many years, this partial jaw and a few other skull fragments were the only known specimens of this extremely rare whale species[3][4]. The discovery on Pitt Island in 1872 marked the beginning of the scientific recognition of this elusive marine mammal, which is considered one of the rarest and least known whale species in the world.
