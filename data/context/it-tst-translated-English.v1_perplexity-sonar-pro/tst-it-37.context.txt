Based on the search results provided, I don't have specific information about the coat of arms of the municipality of Terrazzo in Veneto. The search results don't contain a direct description of Terrazzo's coat of arms.

However, I can provide some related information that might be of interest:

Terrazzo is a comune (municipality) in the Province of Verona in the Italian region of Veneto[1]. While we don't have details about its specific coat of arms, it's common for Italian municipalities to have their own unique heraldic symbols.

The search results do mention a coat of arms for the broader Veneto region:

1. The Coat of Arms of Veneto is described as being drawn based on its blazon, which is a written description free from copyright[5].

2. There's a reference to a vector illustration of the official regional coat of arms of Veneto[7].

3. Another source mentions a coat of arms for the Republic of Veneto, which was apparently part of Italian MSE's subdivided kingdoms from 1945 until it was dissolved[9].

While these don't directly answer the question about Terrazzo's coat of arms, they suggest that heraldic symbols are important in the region.

If you're interested in finding the specific coat of arms for Terrazzo, you might need to consult local municipal records or contact the Terrazzo official website, which is mentioned in the search results (though the link is not provided)[1].
