DOT 4 brake fluid has both dry and wet boiling points, which are important specifications that determine its performance and safety characteristics:

## Dry Boiling Point

The dry boiling point of DOT 4 brake fluid is typically higher than that of DOT 3 fluid. For standard DOT 4 brake fluid:

- The minimum dry boiling point is 446°F (230°C)[1][5].
- Some high-performance DOT 4 fluids can have dry boiling points of up to 509°F (265°C)[4].

## Wet Boiling Point

The wet boiling point is measured after the brake fluid has absorbed 3.7% water by volume, which typically occurs after about two years of use:

- The minimum wet boiling point for DOT 4 brake fluid is 311°F (155°C)[1][3].
- Some high-performance or "Super DOT 4" fluids can have wet boiling points up to 347°F (175°C)[4].

## Importance of Boiling Points

The boiling point is crucial because:

1. It prevents vapor lock: A higher boiling point helps resist vapor formation, which can cause a loss of braking power[8].
2. It maintains performance: Higher boiling points allow the brake fluid to maintain its effectiveness even under extreme conditions, such as heavy braking or high-performance driving[2].
3. It provides a safety margin: The higher boiling point of DOT 4 fluid compared to DOT 3 offers an additional safety margin against brake failure due to fluid vaporization[2].

It's important to note that brake fluid absorbs moisture over time, which lowers its boiling point. This is why regular brake fluid changes are recommended, typically every two years for DOT 4 fluid[7].
