The asteroid 661 Cloelia belongs to the Eos family[1][4]. 

The Eos family is a large asteroid family located in the outer region of the asteroid belt. It is composed of K-type asteroids that are believed to have formed from the breakup of a parent body in a catastrophic collision[4]. 

Some key details about 661 Cloelia and its association with the Eos family:

1. It was discovered on February 22, 1908 by American astronomer Joel Hastings Metcalf[1].

2. Cloelia is explicitly listed as a member of the Eos family in multiple sources[1][4].

3. The Eos family is named after its largest member, 221 Eos. Other notable members besides Cloelia include 339 Dorothea, 450 Brigitta, 513 Centesima, and several others[4].

4. Asteroids in the Eos family share similar orbital characteristics and spectral properties, indicating they likely originated from the same parent body[4].

5. The Eos family is estimated to be about 1-2 billion years old, based on the distribution of asteroid sizes within the family[4].

6. Members of the Eos family, including Cloelia, are classified as K-type asteroids, which have spectral characteristics somewhat different from typical S-type asteroids[4].

So in summary, 661 Cloelia is firmly established as a member of the Eos asteroid family based on its orbital and spectral characteristics.
