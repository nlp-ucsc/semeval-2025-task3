19521 Chaos was discovered by the Deep Ecliptic Survey in 1998[1][3][4]. The Deep Ecliptic Survey was a project aimed at searching for Kuiper Belt objects using the 4-meter telescope at Kitt Peak Observatory[9].

Some key details about the discovery of 19521 Chaos:

- It was found on November 19, 1998[2][4].
- The discovery was made using Kitt Peak's 4-meter telescope[1][3].
- The discoverers were Robert L. Millis, Marc W. Buie, Mark Wagner and James L. Elliot, who were part of the Deep Ecliptic Survey team[2][4].
- It was one of the notable discoveries made by the Deep Ecliptic Survey, which was responsible for finding about two-thirds of the known Kuiper Belt objects at the time the survey concluded[9].

The Deep Ecliptic Survey was a collaborative project that ran concurrently with other asteroid search programs at Lowell Observatory, such as LONEOS (Lowell Observatory Near-Earth Object Search). However, while LONEOS focused on near-Earth objects and main belt asteroids, the Deep Ecliptic Survey specifically targeted the outer solar system to find Kuiper Belt objects like Chaos[9].
