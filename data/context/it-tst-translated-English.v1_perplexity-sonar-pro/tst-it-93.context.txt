The sculpture featured on the cover of Black Sabbath's album "The Eternal Idol" is based on a work by the French sculptor Auguste Rodin[1][2]. Specifically, the album cover recreates Rodin's 1889 sculpture also titled "The Eternal Idol"[1][2].

However, the album cover does not use an actual photograph of Rodin's original sculpture. Instead, it features two models painted in bronze who posed to recreate the sculpture's composition[2]. This was done because the band could not obtain the rights to use an image of the original Rodin sculpture for the album artwork[2].

The recreation process for the album cover was quite involved. The two models were covered in bronze paint and had to pose for hours during the photoshoot[7]. This method of recreating the sculpture's look proved challenging, as covering large parts of the body in paint can be dangerous. Tony Iommi, Black Sabbath's guitarist, recalled that the models "may well have ended up in hospital" due to the toxic nature of the paint, drawing a parallel to an earlier incident where drummer Bill Ward had health issues after being painted gold for a different photoshoot[7].

Rodin's original "The Eternal Idol" sculpture depicts a man kneeling before a standing woman in a pose suggesting reverence and devotion[4]. The sculpture is considered one of Rodin's most evocative works, exploring themes of love, sensuality, and the relationship between men and women[4].
