Ashoka became the ruler of the Mauryan Empire in 268 BCE[1][3][4][6]. He was the third emperor of the Mauryan dynasty and is widely regarded as one of the greatest rulers in Indian history[3].

Ashoka, also known as Ashoka the Great, ascended to the throne after a succession war following the death of his father, Bindusara, in 272 BCE[2]. He defeated his brother Susima to claim the throne[2]. Ashoka's reign lasted from 268 BCE to 232 BCE, a period of about 36 years[1][3][4].

During his rule, Ashoka expanded the already vast Mauryan Empire to cover almost the entire Indian subcontinent[3][4]. His empire stretched from present-day Afghanistan in the west to Bangladesh in the east, with its capital at Pataliputra (modern-day Patna)[3][8].

Ashoka's reign is particularly notable for his conversion to Buddhism following the brutal Kalinga War (c. 260 BCE)[2][3]. This conversion led to a significant shift in his governance style, with Ashoka adopting policies based on Buddhist principles and promoting the spread of Buddhism throughout his empire and beyond[3][9].

Under Ashoka's rule, the Mauryan Empire reached its zenith, both in terms of territorial extent and cultural influence. His reign is often considered the golden age of ancient Indian history, marked by peace, prosperity, and the propagation of Buddhist ideals[3][9].
