The city of Kaspiysk, located in Dagestan, Russia, hosted the 69th UWW European Wrestling Championships from April 30 to May 6, 2018[1][3]. This major European wrestling competition took place at the Ali Aliyev Sport Complex in Kaspiysk[1][3].

The 2018 European Wrestling Championships featured three main wrestling styles:

1. Freestyle Wrestling
2. Greco-Roman Wrestling
3. Women's Freestyle Wrestling

Russia, as the host nation, dominated the competition, winning gold medals in all three wrestling categories[1][3]. The event showcased top wrestlers from across Europe competing in various weight classes for each style of wrestling[1].

During the championships, Russian athletes performed exceptionally well, particularly in the Greco-Roman events. On the third day of the competition, Russian wrestlers won three Greco-Roman gold medals, with victories by Sergey Emelin (60kg), Artem Surkov (67kg), and Adam Kurak (72kg)[5].

The selection of Kaspiysk as the host city was approved by the United World Wrestling (UWW) organization, following Russia's proposal to hold the European Championship in this Dagestani city[7]. This event brought significant attention to Kaspiysk and showcased its ability to host a major international sporting competition.
