Cedric Liddell was a Canadian rower who competed in the Olympic Games[1][4]. He participated in rowing events at two editions of the Olympic Games during his career[1].

Specifically:

1. In the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, Liddell won a bronze medal as part of the Canadian coxed eights team[1][4][7]. Their crew finished just 0.4 seconds ahead of the British team to secure third place[1].

2. He also competed in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, again as part of the Canadian eights team[1][4][7]. However, in this Olympics, his team was eliminated in the opening round[1].

Liddell was a member of the Leander Boat Club in Hamilton, Ontario[1]. He had a successful rowing career beyond the Olympics, including:

- Winning Canada's Henley Royal Regatta every year from 1932 through 1936 as part of the Leander crews[1].
- After the 1936 Olympics, he switched to competing in pairs events and continued rowing into the 1940s[1].
- He qualified for the 1940 Olympics, which were unfortunately cancelled due to World War II[6].

After his competitive career, Liddell took up coaching and was affiliated with the Brockville Rowing Club in Ontario[1].
