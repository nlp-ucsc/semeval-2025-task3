The first modern pentathlon event was held at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden. The inaugural champion was Swedish athlete Gösta Lilliehöök[1][2][3].

Some key details about this historic event:

1. Introduction: Modern pentathlon was introduced at the 5th Olympiad in Stockholm in 1912, inspired by Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic Games[1][2].

2. Format: The original event comprised five disciplines: pistol shooting, fencing, swimming, horse riding, and running[2]. These were chosen to simulate the skills needed by a 19th-century cavalry soldier behind enemy lines[3].

3. Participants: The competition featured 32 athletes from 10 nations[5]. Most early competitors were military officers, as the skills required aligned closely with military training[4].

4. Winner: Gösta Lilliehöök of Sweden emerged victorious, claiming the first gold medal in Olympic modern pentathlon history[1][2].

5. Notable participants: Among the competitors was a young American Lieutenant named George S. Patton, who would later become a famous World War II General. Patton finished fifth in this inaugural competition[2][4].

6. Scoring system: The event used a "lost points" system, where athletes lost points corresponding to their position in each discipline. The final classification was determined by adding up the lost points, with placements assigned in ascending order[5].

This first modern pentathlon event marked the beginning of a new Olympic tradition that has continued to evolve over the past century, remaining a part of the Olympic program ever since its introduction in 1912[1][2][3].
