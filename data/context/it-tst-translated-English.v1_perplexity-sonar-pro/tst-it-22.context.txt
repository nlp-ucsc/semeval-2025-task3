The eighth edition of the World Taekwondo Championships was held in Barcelona, Spain in 1987[3]. Specifically:

- Year: 1987
- Dates: October 7-11
- City: Barcelona
- Country: Spain
- Venue: Palau dels Esports

This was a significant championship as it marked the first time that women's competitions were included alongside the men's events[3]. Both the men's and women's championships were won by South Korea that year.

It's worth noting that the World Taekwondo Championships have been held biennially since their inception in 1973, with Barcelona 1987 being the eighth installment of this prestigious event in the taekwondo calendar.
