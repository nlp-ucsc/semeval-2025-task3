The Aston Martin Vanquish was introduced in 2001 as a successor to the Aston Martin Virage[1]. Specifically, the Vanquish replaced the Virage-based Vantage model that had been in production since 1993[1][4].

The Virage itself was introduced in 1989 as Aston Martin's flagship grand tourer, with a high-performance Vantage variant added to the lineup in 1993. The Vanquish represented a significant leap forward in technology and performance compared to its predecessor, featuring:

1. A new 5.9-liter V12 engine, more powerful than the Virage/Vantage's V8[1][4].
2. An advanced aluminum and carbon fiber chassis structure, moving away from the Virage's more traditional construction[1].
3. More modern, sleek styling by Ian Callum, contrasting with the Virage's boxier design[6].

The transition from Virage/Vantage to Vanquish marked an important evolution for Aston Martin, bridging the gap between their older models and the more advanced designs that would follow in the 21st century[10].
