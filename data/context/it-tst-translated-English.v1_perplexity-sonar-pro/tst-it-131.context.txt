Coins minted during the reign of Bahram I (271-274 CE) of the Sasanian Empire depicted the following key elements:

1. Obverse (front):
The obverse of Bahram I's coins featured a portrait of the king facing right[1]. Specifically:

- Bahram I wore a distinctive crown decorated with ray-shaped spikes, representing the angelic divinity Mithra[1].
- The portrait showed him wearing a diadem and the crown with a large korymbos (a globe-like ornament) on top[5].
- Two ribbons were depicted rising from behind the head[5].
- A legend in Pahlavi script ran along the rim, stating Bahram's name and titles[5].

2. Reverse (back):
The reverse side of Bahram I's coins displayed:

- A Zoroastrian fire altar in the center[1][2].
- Two attendants flanking the fire altar, facing outward[1][5].
- The attendants were depicted wearing crowns - one with a winged crown and korymbos, the other with a mural crown[5].
- Each attendant held a grounded scepter in their outer hand[5].
- Sometimes a legend in Pahlavi script appeared, mentioning "fire of (name of king)"[4].

3. Other details:
- Bahram I's coins were primarily silver drachms, though gold dinars were also minted[5].
- The coins were large and thin, typically weighing about 4 grams with a diameter of 25-30 mm for drachms[4].
- Some coins may have indicated the mint location, though this was not consistent in early Sasanian coinage[4].

Notably, Bahram I reverted the reverse design back to the style used during Shapur I's reign, with the attendants turning their backs to the fire altar instead of facing it[1]. This change in iconography likely had political or religious significance within the context of Sasanian rule.
