The genus Foudia, commonly known as fodies, includes several species of small passerine birds belonging to the weaver family Ploceidae. Here are the known species of Foudia:

1. Red fody or Madagascar fody (Foudia madagascariensis) - Native to Madagascar and introduced to other regions[1][7].

2. Comoros fody or red-headed fody (Foudia eminentissima) - Found in Comoros, Mayotte, and Seychelles[1].

3. Aldabra fody (Foudia aldabrana) - Endemic to Aldabra atoll, part of Seychelles[1][5].

4. Forest fody (Foudia omissa) - Native to Madagascar[1][4].

5. Mauritius fody (Foudia rubra) - Endemic to Mauritius[1][9].

6. Seychelles fody (Foudia sechellarum) - Found on specific Seychelles islands like Cousin, Cousine, and Frégate[1].

7. Rodrigues fody (Foudia flavicans) - Native to Mauritius[1][6].

8. Réunion fody (†Foudia delloni) - This species is extinct and was formerly found on Réunion island[1].

These fodies are typically small birds with distinctive breeding plumage in males, often featuring bright red or yellow coloration on the head and sometimes other parts of the body. They are found primarily in the western Indian Ocean region, with Madagascar being a significant center of their diversity[1][4]. Some species, like the red fody, have been introduced to areas outside their native range[7].
