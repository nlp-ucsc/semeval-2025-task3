Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! was primarily known and released under that title in US theaters. However, the film went through a few working titles during development before settling on its iconic final name:

1. The Leather Girls - This was the title of the first draft screenplay written by Jack Moran over a four-day period[1].

2. The Mankillers - This was another working title used during the early stages of production[1].

The film ultimately premiered and was released in the United States on August 6, 1965 under the title Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill![3]. This final title was suggested by the film's sound editor, Richard S. Brummer, during production[1].

While the film did not have alternate theatrical release titles in the US, it's worth noting that it has been known by slightly different names in other countries:

- In Finland, it was released as "Faster Pussycat... Kill Kill" (without the exclamation points) and "Faster, pussycat! Kill! Kill" (with only one exclamation point at the end) for TV broadcasts[3].

- In French-speaking Canada, it was known as "Plus vite, mes chattes, tuez! tuez!" which translates to "Faster, my cats, kill! kill!"[3].

However, for its US theatrical run, the film was consistently marketed and exhibited under the now-famous title Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!
