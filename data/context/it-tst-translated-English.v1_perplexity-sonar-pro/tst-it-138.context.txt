The Second Council of Nicaea met in the church of Hagia Sophia (Church of Holy Wisdom) in the city of Nicaea, which is located in present-day İznik, Turkey[1][3]. The council opened on September 24, 787 CE[2][3].

Some key details about the location and setting:

1. Nicaea (modern İznik) is situated in northwestern Anatolia, in the region of Bithynia[1].

2. The city is located at the eastern end of Lake Ascanius, surrounded by hills to the north and south[1].

3. Nicaea was chosen as the location after an initial attempt to hold the council in Constantinople was disrupted by iconoclast soldiers[3].

4. The Hagia Sophia church in Nicaea where the council met should not be confused with the more famous Hagia Sophia in Constantinople (modern Istanbul). The ruins of the Nicaean Hagia Sophia still survive today[10].

5. Approximately 350 bishops attended the council, with 308 ultimately signing its acts[3].

The choice of Nicaea as the location was significant for several reasons:

1. It was the site of the First Council of Nicaea in 325 CE, providing a symbolic connection to the earlier ecumenical council[2].

2. Nicaea was considered safer than Constantinople, which was thought to harbor too many iconoclasts for the council to be conducted securely[3].

3. The city's strong fortifications, including 5 kilometers of high walls and its position next to a large lake, provided additional security for the council attendees[1].
