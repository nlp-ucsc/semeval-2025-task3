The Fifth Brigade of the Zimbabwe National Army perpetrated the Gukurahundi massacres in Zimbabwe[1][2][3]. 

Key details about the Fifth Brigade and Gukurahundi:

1. Formation: The Fifth Brigade was formed in 1981 after Robert Mugabe signed an agreement with North Korean leader Kim Il Sung in October 1980 to have North Korea train a brigade for Zimbabwe's army[1].

2. Composition: The Fifth Brigade was comprised of approximately 3,500 ex-ZANLA troops, drawn mainly from the Shona ethnic group[1].

3. Command structure: Unlike other army units, the Fifth Brigade was directly subordinated to the Prime Minister's office and not integrated into normal army command structures[1].

4. Distinguishing features: The Fifth Brigade soldiers wore red berets and had codes, uniforms, radios and equipment incompatible with other army units[1].

5. Leadership: The first commander of the Fifth Brigade was Colonel Perrance Shiri[1].

6. Deployment: The Fifth Brigade was deployed to Matabeleland North in January 1983, marking the beginning of the Gukurahundi massacres[1][2].

7. Targets: The Fifth Brigade primarily targeted ethnic Ndebele civilians in Matabeleland and Midlands provinces[2][4].

8. Scale of atrocities: Over the course of about four years (1983-1987), the Fifth Brigade killed more than 20,000 civilians, with some estimates ranging up to 30,000 deaths. Additionally, thousands were detained, tortured, or raped[2][4].

9. Motivation: The massacres were aimed at crushing dissent and eliminating political opposition, particularly supporters of Joshua Nkomo's ZAPU party[1][2].

The Gukurahundi massacres are widely recognized as a genocide against the Ndebele people, though the Zimbabwean government has never officially acknowledged it as such[4].
