Richard Gottehrer produced Blondie's album "Plastic Letters"[1][2][4][5]. This was the second and final Blondie album to be produced by Gottehrer, who had also produced the band's self-titled debut album[5][6]. 

The album was recorded in June and July of 1977 at Plaza Sound in New York City[5]. Despite some difficulties during the recording process, including bassist Gary Valentine leaving the band prior to the sessions, Gottehrer's production helped maintain consistency with their debut album while allowing for some sonic improvements and variations in style[4][7].

Gottehrer's production style on "Plastic Letters" has been noted for its casual approach, which allowed for a looser sound and preserved some of the raw emotion and rough edges in the band's performance[7]. This contrasts with the more polished production style of Mike Chapman on Blondie's subsequent albums[7].

"Plastic Letters" was released in February 1978 through Chrysalis Records, though an earlier version with a different track order had been released in Japan in December 1977[5]. The album helped pave the way for Blondie's mainstream breakthrough, which would come with their next album "Parallel Lines" later that same year[1].
