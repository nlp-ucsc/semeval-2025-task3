Sebastian Vettel started in pole position at the 2018 Chinese Grand Prix[1][2][3]. He set a blistering lap time of 1:31.095 in the final qualifying session to secure pole position, edging out his Ferrari teammate Kimi Raikkonen by just 0.087 seconds[1][3]. This was Vettel's 52nd career pole position and his second consecutive pole of the 2018 season[3]. 

Vettel's pole-winning lap also broke the previous track record at the Shanghai International Circuit[3]. The Ferrari cars showed impressive pace throughout qualifying, with Vettel and Raikkonen locking out the front row for Ferrari[2]. This marked Ferrari's first back-to-back front row lockouts in 12 years[8].

The Mercedes drivers struggled to match Ferrari's pace in qualifying. Valtteri Bottas qualified third, over half a second behind Vettel, while Lewis Hamilton could only manage fourth place on the grid[1][2]. The Red Bull drivers Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo rounded out the top six qualifiers[3].
