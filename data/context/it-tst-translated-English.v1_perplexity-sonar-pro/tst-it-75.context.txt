The washed rind of Maroilles cheese has a distinctive orange-red color[1][2][3][5]. This characteristic hue develops during the aging process, which typically takes place in humid cellars[2]. 

The color formation occurs through several steps:

1. Initially, after the cheese is shaped and salted, it develops a light blue mold when left in a ventilated area for about 10 days[3][5].

2. The cheese is then moved to aging cellars where it undergoes regular washing and brushing with salted water, sometimes mixed with beer[2][3].

3. During this process, which lasts for at least 5 weeks (though often up to 4 months), the rind gradually changes color[2][5].

4. A bacteria called "red ferment" (Brevibacterium linens) is introduced, which contributes to the development of the cheese's aroma and causes the rind to redden[2][6].

5. The repeated washing and brushing remove the natural white mold, allowing the red bacteria to thrive and transform the rind from yellow to orange and finally to red[5][7].

The result is a moist, orange-red rind that is often described as having a streaky or mottled appearance[2][5]. This vibrant color, along with its rectangular shape and strong aroma, makes Maroilles a visually distinctive cheese.
