According to the search results, fans could choose 10 tracks out of 20 available songs to create their own customized version of the album "The Future Is Medieval" by Kaiser Chiefs[1][2][6][8].

The band implemented an innovative release strategy for this album. They uploaded 20 new songs to their website and allowed listeners to select any 10 of these tracks to compile their own personalized version of the album[2][6]. This unique approach gave fans the opportunity to curate their own listening experience based on their preferences.

Additionally, fans could create custom artwork for their version of the album using designs provided by the band[2]. This further enhanced the personalization aspect of the release.

Interestingly, after choosing their 10 tracks and creating the artwork, fans could even sell their customized version of the album to others and earn money from each sale[2]. This added an entrepreneurial element to the album release, allowing fans to potentially profit from their curation choices.

It's worth noting that after this initial customizable release, the band later put out an official 13-track version of the album for traditional retail release[2]. However, the original 20-track pool remained available on their website for fans who wanted to continue creating their own versions of "The Future Is Medieval"[2][4].
