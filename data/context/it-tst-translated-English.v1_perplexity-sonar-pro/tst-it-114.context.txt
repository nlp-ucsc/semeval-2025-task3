The light cruiser Emden was not technically sunk in 1945, but was scuttled by her own crew near Kiel, Germany in the final days of World War II. Here are the key details:

In April 1945, Emden was severely damaged by Allied air raids while in port at Kiel. On the night of April 9-10, a bombing raid caused extensive damage to ships in the harbor, including Emden[2]. 

To prevent her from sinking in the harbor, Emden was towed out into Heikendorfer Bucht (Heikendorf Bay) on April 14 and deliberately run aground in shallow water[2]. She was listing 15 degrees to port, but the crew managed to stop the flooding and seal the hull[2].

On April 26, 1945, Emden was officially decommissioned while grounded in the shallows of Heikendorfer Bucht[2].

Finally, on May 3, 1945, just days before the end of the war in Europe, Emden's crew destroyed the ship with explosives to prevent her capture by advancing Allied forces[2][3]. This act of scuttling took place while the ship was still grounded in Heikendorfer Bucht near Kiel.

After the war, the wreck of Emden remained in place and was gradually broken up for scrap over the following five years[2].

So to summarize, Emden was not sunk in combat, but was deliberately scuttled by her own crew on May 3, 1945, while grounded in shallow water in Heikendorfer Bucht near Kiel, Germany.
