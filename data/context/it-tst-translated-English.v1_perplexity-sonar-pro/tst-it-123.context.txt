Air France Flight 296 was originally planned to depart from Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris and arrive at Basel-Mulhouse Airport, with a flyover at Mulhouse-Habsheim Airport as part of an air show[1][5]. Specifically:

1. The flight was to take off from Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris.

2. It was then supposed to fly to Basel-Mulhouse Airport for a press conference.

3. After the press conference, charter passengers would board the plane at Basel-Mulhouse Airport.

4. The aircraft would then make a short flight to Habsheim aerodrome for the air show flyover.

5. Following the flyover, the plan was to take the passengers on a sightseeing trip to Mont Blanc.

6. Finally, the flight was scheduled to return to Basel-Mulhouse Airport to drop off the passengers.

7. After that, the aircraft was meant to return to Paris.

However, the accident occurred during the flyover at Mulhouse-Habsheim Airport on June 26, 1988, when the Airbus A320 crashed into trees at the end of the runway while attempting a low-altitude pass[1][2]. This happened before the planned sightseeing portion of the flight could take place.
