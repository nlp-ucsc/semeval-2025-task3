At the beginning of his career, Jaume Doménech Sánchez played for Villarreal CF's youth teams. He started in the Villarreal U19 squad in the 2008/09 season[6]. After that, he progressed through Villarreal's lower teams, playing for Villarreal C in the 2010/11 and 2011/12 seasons[1].

Specifically, his early career progression was as follows:

1. 2008/09: Villarreal U19
2. 2009/10: Villarreal C and a loan spell at CD Onda
3. 2010/11: Villarreal C
4. 2011/12: Villarreal B and Villarreal C

It's worth noting that during the 2009/10 season, while officially part of Villarreal C, Doménech was loaned out to CD Onda, where he made 33 appearances in the Tercera División (fourth tier of Spanish football)[1]. This loan spell provided him with valuable first-team experience early in his career.

After his time in the Villarreal system, Doménech had brief stints with CD El Palo and Huracán Valencia CF in 2012/13 before joining Valencia CF's reserve team in 2013, which marked the beginning of his long association with Valencia[1][3].
