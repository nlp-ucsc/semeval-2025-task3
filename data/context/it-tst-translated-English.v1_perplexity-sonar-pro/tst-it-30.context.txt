In Burmese Buddhism, there are specific rules and traditions for choosing Dhamma names (also called bwe in Burmese). Here are the key points about how Dhamma names are chosen in the Burmese Buddhist tradition:

1. The Dhamma name is typically given by the head monk of the monastery where a person is ordained[1].

2. The name is chosen in Pali, the sacred language of Theravada Buddhism[1].

3. The traditional Burmese naming system is used to select the name. This system stipulates that the first letter of one's name is determined by the day of the week on which they were born[1][4]. The correspondence is as follows:

   - Sunday: a, i, u
   - Monday: k, kh, g, gh, ṅ
   - Tuesday: c, ch, j, jh, ñ
   - Wednesday: y, r, l, v
   - Thursday: p, ph, b, bh, m
   - Friday: s, h
   - Saturday: t, th, d, dh, n

4. Examples of names based on birth days:
   - Sunday: Uttarañāṇa
   - Monday: Kovida
   - Tuesday: Chekinda
   - Wednesday: Revata
   - Thursday: Paṇḍita
   - Friday: Sīlānanda
   - Saturday: Dhammapāla[4]

5. The Dhamma name is considered aspirational rather than descriptive[1]. It often reflects qualities or aspects of Buddhist teaching that the individual is encouraged to embody or cultivate.

6. While the name is formally given, it's worth noting that in practice, especially for highly respected monks, people often use other forms of address out of respect. For instance, they might use a title like "Sayadaw" (meaning "royal teacher") followed by the place the monk is associated with, rather than their given Dhamma name[4].

7. This naming tradition applies to both monastic and lay practitioners who undergo Buddhist initiation rituals[1].

It's important to note that while these are the general rules, there can be some variation in practice. The specific choice of name might also be influenced by the lineage or tradition of the monastery, as well as the individual insights of the head monk giving the name.
