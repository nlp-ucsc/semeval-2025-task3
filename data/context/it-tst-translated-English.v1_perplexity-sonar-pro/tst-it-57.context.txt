Gödöllő is located in Pest County, Hungary, approximately 30 kilometers (about 20 miles) northeast of Budapest[1][2]. It is situated in the Budapest metropolitan area, making it easily accessible from the capital city[1][5].

Some key details about Gödöllő's location:

1. It lies in the Gödöllő Hill Region, which is a transitional area between mountains and plains[1].

2. The town is positioned on the banks of the Rákos stream, in the valley of the Gödöllő downs[2].

3. Gödöllő is surrounded by about 100 square kilometers of forest land, with pine, acacia, and oak trees being predominant[2].

4. It has good transportation connections:
   - The Budapest-Miskolc main railway line passes through the town[2].
   - Main road 3 crosses Gödöllő[2].
   - The M3 and M31 motorways are nearby, providing quick access to Budapest and Ferihegy Airport (about a 25-minute drive)[2].

5. The town serves as a traffic node and is considered one of the most attractive settlements in the Budapest area due to its natural surroundings and favorable geographical position[2][5].

Gödöllő's proximity to Budapest, combined with its rich historical and cultural heritage (notably the Royal Palace of Gödöllő), makes it a popular destination for both tourists and those looking to live outside the capital while maintaining easy access to it[5].
