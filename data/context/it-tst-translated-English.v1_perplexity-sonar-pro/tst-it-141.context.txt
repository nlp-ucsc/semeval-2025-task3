Domantas Sabonis has several nicknames used by friends, teammates, and fans:

1. "Domas" - This is a common shortened version of his first name that he's often called[1][3].

2. "Sabas Jr." - A reference to his father, Arvydas Sabonis, who was also a famous basketball player[7].

3. "Lithuanian Lasagna" - A humorous nickname given by Shaquille O'Neal during a TNT broadcast, which Sabonis himself approved of and found amusing[4].

4. "Ones" - This nickname originated during his time with the Indiana Pacers and has stuck with him. Sabonis even used it as the name for his new Napa Valley wine label, "Ones by Sabonis"[1][9].

5. "Dodo" - Another playful nickname mentioned by Sabonis himself[1].

While not exactly a nickname, it's worth noting that Sabonis is sometimes referred to as "Sabas" like his father, though this seems to be more of a general shortening of his last name rather than a personal nickname[7].
