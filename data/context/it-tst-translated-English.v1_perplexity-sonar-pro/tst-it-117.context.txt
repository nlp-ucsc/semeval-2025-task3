Aukštojas Hill is located in the Vilnius District Municipality of Lithuania[1][2][7]. This municipality is situated in the eastern part of the country, approximately 24 kilometers (15 miles) southeast of the capital city of Vilnius[1][4][5].

The hill is specifically situated in the Medininkai Highlands, within the Migūnai forestry area[1][4][5]. It's part of a region known for its slightly hilly terrain, which was shaped by glacial activity in the past[2]. The surrounding area is characterized by a mix of agricultural land and forested areas, with a grove of pine trees at the summit, which is typical of the Medininkai region[1][5].

The location of Aukštojas Hill makes it easily accessible for visitors from Vilnius, with the journey taking about 30-40 minutes by car[3]. Its proximity to the capital city and its status as the highest point in Lithuania have made it a popular destination for hikers, nature enthusiasts, and tourists interested in experiencing Lithuania's natural landscapes[6][8].
