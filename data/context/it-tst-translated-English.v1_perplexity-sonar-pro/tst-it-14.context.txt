The governorate of Tataouine was established on March 2, 1981[1][4]. It was created by splitting off from the governorate of Médenine[4]. Tataouine became one of the 24 governorates of Tunisia at that time[1][4].

Some key details about the establishment of Tataouine Governorate:

- It was created relatively recently compared to some other Tunisian governorates, as part of administrative reorganization in the early 1980s.
- The date of March 2, 1981 marks its official creation as a separate governorate.
- Prior to 1981, the area was part of the larger Médenine Governorate to the north.
- It became the southernmost governorate of Tunisia, bordering both Algeria and Libya.
- At 38,889 km², it also became the largest governorate by area in Tunisia upon its establishment[1][2].

So in summary, Tataouine Governorate has existed as a distinct administrative division of Tunisia for just over 40 years, having been formally established on March 2, 1981.
