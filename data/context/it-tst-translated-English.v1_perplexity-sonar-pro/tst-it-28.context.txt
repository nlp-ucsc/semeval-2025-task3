Guillaume Budé served as secretary to multiple French kings:

1. He was first appointed as a royal secretary to King Charles VIII, who ruled from 1483 to 1498[1].

2. Budé then continued as secretary under King Louis XII, who reigned from 1498 to 1515. In 1502, Louis XII sent Budé to Rome as the French ambassador for the coronation of Pope Julius II[3][6].

3. Finally, Budé served King Francis I, who ruled from 1515 to 1547. He became Francis I's secretary in 1517 and held several important positions during his reign[1][2]. 

Under Francis I, Budé's influence grew significantly. He was appointed as the master of the royal library at Fontainebleau and played a key role in establishing the Collège de France in 1530[2][3]. Budé also served as an ambassador to Rome for Francis I and held other important judicial and civil administrative posts during his reign[2].

So while Budé served multiple French monarchs as secretary, his most prominent and influential period of service was under King Francis I in the early 16th century.
