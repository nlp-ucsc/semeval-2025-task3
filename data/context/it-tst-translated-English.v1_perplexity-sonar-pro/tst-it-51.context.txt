The scientific name of the brown-headed crow is Corvus fuscicapillus[1][4]. Let's break down the meaning of this scientific name:

1. Genus: Corvus
   - Corvus is the genus name for crows and ravens.
   - It comes from the Latin word "corvus," which directly means "raven" or "crow."

2. Species: fuscicapillus
   - This is a compound word made up of two Latin parts:
     - "fusci-" comes from "fuscus," meaning "dark, swarthy, or dusky"
     - "-capillus" means "hair" or "head"
   
   When combined, "fuscicapillus" essentially means "dark-headed" or "dusky-headed," which accurately describes the brown head of this crow species.

Therefore, the full scientific name Corvus fuscicapillus translates to "dark-headed crow," which is a fitting description of the brown-headed crow's appearance[1].
