The Fens, a distinctive marshy region in eastern England, extend across several ceremonial counties:

1. Lincolnshire: The Fens cover a significant portion of southern Lincolnshire, including areas around Boston and Spalding[4][5].

2. Cambridgeshire: A large part of the Fens lies within Cambridgeshire, including the city of Ely and the area around Peterborough[2][4][5].

3. Norfolk: The Fens extend into western Norfolk[4][5].

4. Suffolk: A small area of Suffolk is also part of the Fenland region, though this is a relatively minor portion compared to the other counties[4][5].

Additionally, while not always included in the strictest definitions of the Fens, some sources also mention:

5. Northamptonshire: Specifically, the Soke of Peterborough, which is now part of Cambridgeshire but was historically part of Northamptonshire, is sometimes included in broader definitions of the Fenland area[3].

The Fens cover a total area of approximately 1,500 square miles (3,900 kmÂ²)[4][5]. This low-lying region is characterized by its history of drainage and reclamation, transforming what was once a vast wetland into highly productive agricultural land. The area is known for its flat landscape, rich biodiversity, and significant agricultural output, containing around half of the grade 1 agricultural land in England[5].

It's worth noting that while these ceremonial counties encompass the Fens, the region itself is defined more by its geographical and ecological characteristics than by modern administrative boundaries. The landscape and history of the Fens have played a crucial role in shaping the culture and economy of this unique part of England.
