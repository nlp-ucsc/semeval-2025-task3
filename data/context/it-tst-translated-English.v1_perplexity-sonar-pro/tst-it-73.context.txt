The initial line-up of the band HEALTH consisted of:

- Jake Duzsik (vocals, guitar)
- John Famiglietti (bass)
- Jupiter Keyes (guitar, keyboards)
- BJ Miller (drums)

HEALTH was founded in 2005 in Los Angeles, California[1][2]. Jake Duzsik and John Famiglietti met while working at Guitar Center in Los Angeles and decided to form a band. They recruited Jupiter Keyes, whom Duzsik knew from university, and found drummer BJ Miller through Craigslist to complete the original four-member lineup[4].

This core group of four members remained stable for about a decade, until Jupiter Keyes left the band in 2015[1]. Since then, HEALTH has continued as a trio consisting of Duzsik, Famiglietti, and Miller.
