Based on the search results provided, the river that crosses the French commune of Amoncourt is the Lanterne River.

The Lanterne is a river in eastern France, described as a substantial left tributary of the Saône River[1]. It flows through several towns and villages in the Haute-Saône department, including Amoncourt[1]. Specifically, the search results mention that the Lanterne passes through Amoncourt on its course[1].

Some key details about the Lanterne River:

1. Length: It is 64.3 km (40.0 mi) long[1].
2. Course: It rises in the Vosges mountains and flows generally westward and southwestward[1].
3. Watershed: The Lanterne's watershed contains over 1,000 bodies of water, notably in the "Plateau des Mille Étangs" (plateau of a thousand ponds) in the Vosges Massif[1].
4. Confluence: The Lanterne joins the Saône River at Conflandey, just downstream of Fleurey-lès-Faverney[1].

It's worth noting that Amoncourt is a small commune in the Haute-Saône department, located in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region of eastern France[6]. The commune is situated along the course of the Lanterne River, which plays a significant role in the local geography and hydrology of the area.
