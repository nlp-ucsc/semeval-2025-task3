Gordon Strachan has three children:

1. Craig Strachan
2. Gavin Strachan 
3. Gemma Strachan

Both of Gordon's sons, Craig and Gavin, followed in their father's footsteps and became professional footballers[5][6]. Gavin Strachan in particular has had a notable career in football:

- Gavin was born on December 23, 1978[1].
- He played professionally for several clubs including Coventry City, Peterborough United, and others[1].
- Gavin received 8 caps for the Scotland U21 national team[1].
- He later moved into coaching and management roles, including being assistant manager at Doncaster Rovers and Peterborough United[1].
- In June 2020, Gavin became a first team coach at Celtic FC[2], the club his father Gordon had previously managed.

Gavin has continued the family's football legacy, as his own son Luke Strachan is also a footballer, currently playing for Dundee FC[3]. This makes Gordon Strachan not only a father of footballers, but also a grandfather to one.
