The 2011 UEFA Super Cup was contested between Barcelona and FC Porto[1][4]. 

Barcelona, the UEFA Champions League holders, faced FC Porto, the UEFA Europa League winners, in this match[4]. The game took place on Friday, August 26, 2011, at the Stade Louis II in Monaco[1][4].

Barcelona emerged victorious with a 2-0 win over Porto[1]. The goals were scored by:

1. Lionel Messi (39th minute)
2. Cesc Fàbregas (87th minute)

This victory marked Barcelona's fourth UEFA Super Cup title, as they were making a record eighth appearance in the competition[6]. For Porto, this was their fourth Super Cup appearance, having won once before[3].

The match was notable for two red cards shown to Porto players:
