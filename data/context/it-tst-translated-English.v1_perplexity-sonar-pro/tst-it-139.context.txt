Some additional details about Bolatti's international career:

1. He earned a total of 12 caps (appearances) for Argentina[1][5].
2. His first cap came against Russia on August 12, 2009[1].
3. The goal against Uruguay was not only his first but also his only international goal[4][5].
4. Bolatti was included in Argentina's 23-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa[4].
