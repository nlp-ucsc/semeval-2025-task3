The town of Lockhart, Texas was used to represent the fictional town of Jarden in the TV series The Leftovers[1][5][9].

Some key details about the filming location:

1. Lockhart is located about 30 miles southeast of Austin, Texas[1].

2. The producers chose Lockhart after looking at locations in Atlanta and California, but were drawn to Lockhart's well-preserved architecture and lack of chain stores like Starbucks or McDonald's[1][5].

3. The Caldwell County Courthouse in Lockhart features prominently in several episodes and promotional materials for the show[9]. This beautiful Second Empire-style building dominates Lockhart's town square.

4. Filming for the second season of The Leftovers, which introduced Jarden (also called Miracle), took place in Lockhart and surrounding areas of Central Texas in 2015[3][9].

5. Other nearby locations used for filming included Richard Moya Park, Moore's Crossing Bridge, Pedernales Falls State Park, and McKinney Falls State Park[7].

6. The production team erected a "tower" on the Courthouse Square in Lockhart as part of transforming it into the fictional Jarden[3].

7. Lockhart is known as the "Barbecue Capital of Texas," which added to its appeal as a filming location[1][5].

The choice of Lockhart allowed The Leftovers to create a convincing small-town Texas setting for the fictional Jarden, leveraging the town's historic architecture and charming town square to bring the story to life.
