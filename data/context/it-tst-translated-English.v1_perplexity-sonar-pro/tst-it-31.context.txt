The Bundesautobahn 73 (A73) connects the city of Suhl in southern Thuringia with the city of Nuremberg in Central Franconia, Germany[1]. 

Specifically, the A73 begins at the Suhl autobahn triangle (where it intersects with the A71) and runs south, passing through several key cities and areas:

1. Coburg
2. Lichtenfels 
3. Bamberg
4. Erlangen
5. FÃ¼rth
6. Nuremberg

The section between Bamberg and Nuremberg is also known as the Frankenschnellweg (Franconian Expressway)[10]. 

Some additional details about the A73:

- The Suhl to Lichtenfels section was constructed as part of the German Unity Transport Project No. 16 and opened to traffic on September 5, 2008[1].
- This new section cost approximately 794 million euros and covers an area of 1,557 hectares, including 590 hectares of traffic areas and 967 hectares of compensation areas[1].
- Between Schleusingen and Coburg-Nord, and between Bamberg and Erlangen, the A73 runs parallel and close to the B4 (or the old route of the B4) and partially replaces it[1].

The A73 serves as an important north-south connection in eastern Germany, linking Thuringia with northern Bavaria and providing a crucial transportation route for both passenger and commercial traffic in the region.
