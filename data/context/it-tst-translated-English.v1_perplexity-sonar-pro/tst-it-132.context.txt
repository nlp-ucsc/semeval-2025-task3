Enrico Accatino, an Italian artist who lived from 1920 to 2007, is associated with the term "Carte Costruite" (Constructed Papers)[1][5]. This term refers to a technique of creating collages using papers that have been previously prepared with tempera or acrylic paints.

Accatino was a multifaceted artist who explored various mediums and techniques throughout his career. He was not only a painter but also worked as a sculptor and was involved in other artistic disciplines[1]. His work with "Carte Costruite" represents one of the innovative techniques he developed during his artistic journey.

The "Carte Costruite" technique involves a process where the artist first prepares papers with tempera or acrylic paints. These prepared papers are then used to create collages, resulting in unique and textured artworks. This method allows for a high degree of control over color and texture, as the artist can manipulate the papers before incorporating them into the final composition.

Accatino's exploration of this technique was part of his broader artistic experimentation. Throughout his career, he engaged with various forms of artistic expression, including painting, sculpture, and printmaking. His work with "Carte Costruite" demonstrates his interest in pushing the boundaries of traditional artistic methods and materials[5].

It's worth noting that while Accatino is credited with introducing the term "Carte Costruite" in the context of his artistic practice, the concept of using prepared papers in collage work has been explored by various artists throughout the 20th century. Accatino's contribution lies in his specific approach to this technique and his role in popularizing it within the Italian art scene.
