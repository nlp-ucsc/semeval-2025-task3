The fossils found in the Chengjiang fossil site date to the early Cambrian period, specifically around 530-518 million years ago[1][2][3]. This places them in the Terreneuvian Epoch of the Cambrian Period, which spans from 541 million to 521 million years ago[1].

The Chengjiang fossils are particularly significant because they provide an exceptional record of the rapid diversification of life that occurred during the early Cambrian, a phenomenon known as the "Cambrian explosion"[3]. This was a crucial time in Earth's history when most major groups of animals first appeared in the fossil record and complex ecosystems began to develop.

The age of the Chengjiang Lagerstätte is locally termed Qiongzhusian, which correlates to the late Atdabanian Stage in Siberian sequences of the middle of the Early Cambrian[2]. More precisely, the shales containing the fossils have been dated to ≤518 million years ago[2].

These fossils are among the oldest known examples of many animal groups, including some of the earliest known vertebrates and possibly the oldest chordates in the fossil record[1]. They provide a unique window into the structure and diversity of early Cambrian marine communities, making the Chengjiang fossil site one of the most important locations in the world for understanding the evolution of early multicellular life[3].
