Sophie Nélisse won the Genie Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the 2011 film "Monsieur Lazhar"[1][2][6]. This was her debut film role, which she took on at the age of 10[4]. Her portrayal of Alice L'Écuyer, a precocious grade-schooler dealing with the aftermath of her teacher's suicide, earned her critical acclaim and multiple awards[4][6].

In addition to the Genie Award, Nélisse also won a Jutra Award for Best Supporting Actress for the same role[1][2][10]. At the time of her Genie win, she was 11 years old, making her the youngest Genie winner since Nina Petronzio in 1991[6].

"Monsieur Lazhar" was a highly successful film, receiving nine Genie nominations overall and winning six, including Best Picture[6]. The film was also nominated for an Oscar in the Best Foreign Language Film category[6].

This early success in "Monsieur Lazhar" helped launch Nélisse's acting career, leading to her later starring roles in films such as "The Book Thief" and her current role in the television series "Yellowjackets"[2][5].
