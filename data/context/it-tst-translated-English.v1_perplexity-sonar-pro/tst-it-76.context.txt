The symbol of the Popular Democratic Front (Fronte Democratico Popolare) in Italy featured an image of Giuseppe Garibaldi, the Italian unification hero, surmounted by a green star[1]. 

Giuseppe Garibaldi was a key figure in the Italian Risorgimento, the 19th century movement for Italian unification. He was renowned for his military campaigns that helped unite Italy and is considered one of the "fathers of the fatherland" in Italian history. By incorporating Garibaldi's image into their symbol, the Popular Democratic Front was likely attempting to associate themselves with his legacy of Italian nationalism and unification.

The green star above Garibaldi's image was likely meant to represent hope or socialism, as green is often associated with these concepts in political symbolism. This combination of nationalist imagery (Garibaldi) with socialist symbolism (the star) reflected the coalition's attempt to unite left-wing parties, including the Italian Communist Party and Italian Socialist Party, under a broad front in the 1948 Italian general election[1].
