The two main ports of Agistri island are:

1. Skala
2. Megalochori (also known as Myloi or Milos)

Skala is the primary port and main tourist resort on Agistri. It's where most ferries from Piraeus arrive and depart[1][5]. Skala offers a good selection of tavernas, shops, and accommodation options for visitors[5].

Megalochori, also referred to as Myloi or Milos, is the island's capital and secondary port[1][4]. It's where the high-speed ferries (flying dolphins) from Piraeus typically dock[2]. Megalochori is slightly more residential compared to Skala but still offers amenities for tourists[4].

These two ports are located quite close to each other, about 1-1.5 km apart (approximately a 15-20 minute walk)[1][4]. Both ports connect Agistri to Piraeus and other islands in the Saronic Gulf, with regular ferry services throughout the year[2][3].

It's worth noting that when booking ferry tickets or accommodations, you should pay attention to which port you'll be arriving at or staying near, as this can affect your travel plans on the island[5].
