I apologize, but I don't have any specific information about who dubbed Catherine McCormack's voice in the Italian version of "The Tailor of Panama." The search results don't provide details about the Italian dubbing cast for this particular film. 

In general, major Hollywood films are typically dubbed into Italian for release in Italy, with professional voice actors providing the Italian dialogue. However, without access to the Italian dubbing credits for this specific movie, I cannot confirm who voiced Catherine McCormack's character Francesca Deane in the Italian version.

If you're interested in finding this information, you may want to check Italian movie databases or dubbing studio records, as they sometimes list voice actors for foreign films. Alternatively, you could try contacting the Italian distributor of the film directly to inquire about the dubbing cast.
