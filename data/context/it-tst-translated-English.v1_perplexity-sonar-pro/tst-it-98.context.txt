The Oxford Covered Market was officially inaugurated on November 1, 1774[1][3]. This historic market has been a significant part of Oxford's commercial and cultural landscape for 250 years, making it one of the oldest continually operating markets in the United Kingdom[1].

The market's origins can be traced back to the Oxford Improvement Act of 1771, which proposed plans for a covered city market to bring disparate street traders under one roof and improve public health[1]. A market committee was established, bringing together representatives from both the City and the University. John Gwynn, the architect responsible for Magdalen Bridge, was appointed to design the new market[1][3].

When it first opened in 1774, the Covered Market was smaller than its current form and featured timber stalls[1]. Over time, the market expanded and evolved:

- In the 1840s, there was a partial expansion of the market, transforming it into its current form and adding the Market Street entrances[1].
- Throughout the 19th century, the variety of traders expanded. While it was originally conceived primarily as a meat market, it gradually incorporated fruit, vegetables, fish, and cheese vendors[1].
- By the end of the 19th century, cafes, eateries, and non-food outlets began to emerge in the market[1].

Today, the Oxford Covered Market remains a vibrant and integral part of the city, housing over 50 specialist independent traders[3]. It has survived various challenges, including a post-war proposal to demolish and relocate it. In recognition of its historical and architectural significance, the market was listed as a Grade II structure in March 2000[1].

As it celebrates its 250th anniversary in 2024, the Oxford Covered Market continues to be a beloved destination for both locals and visitors, offering a unique shopping experience that blends centuries of tradition with modern commerce[1][2].
