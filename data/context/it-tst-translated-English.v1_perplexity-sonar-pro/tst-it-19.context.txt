In the film "Sweet Home Alabama," Andrew's mother, Kate Hennings (played by Candice Bergen), plays a significant role during the wedding scene between Andrew and Melanie. Kate, who is the Mayor of New York City, is present at the wedding ceremony in Alabama[5].

During the wedding, a dramatic turn of events unfolds. As Melanie is walking down the aisle, her lawyer interrupts the ceremony with the revelation that while Jake (Melanie's estranged husband) has signed the divorce papers, Melanie herself has not[5]. This interruption leads to a pivotal moment where Melanie realizes she doesn't want to marry Andrew because she still loves Jake[5].

While the specific actions or reactions of Kate Hennings during this moment are not explicitly detailed in the available search results, it's reasonable to assume that as Andrew's mother and a politically conscious figure, she would be deeply concerned and likely upset by this turn of events. The situation would be particularly embarrassing for her, given her position as Mayor of New York City and her aspirations for Andrew's political future[5].

The scene ultimately culminates in Melanie not marrying Andrew and instead running off to find Jake[5]. This outcome would undoubtedly be a significant disappointment and source of frustration for Kate Hennings, who had doubts about Melanie's suitability for her son from the beginning[5].
