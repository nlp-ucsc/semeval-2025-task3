The plasmodium of Fuligo septica, commonly known as dog vomit slime mold or scrambled egg slime mold, exhibits several color variations:

1. Bright yellow: This is the most common and distinctive color of Fuligo septica's plasmodium[1][2][3]. The bright yellow hue is what often draws attention to this organism in gardens and wooded areas.

2. Orange-yellow: Some variations of the plasmodium can appear in an orange-yellow shade[2].

3. White to grayish-white: As the plasmodium matures into an aethalium (the spore-bearing structure), it can transform from yellow to a white or grayish-white color[2][4].

4. Tan: The color can fade to tan as the organism ages and dries out[4][10].

5. Pinkish tan: In some cases, as the aethalium degrades, it may darken to a pinkish tan color before releasing its spores[7].

6. Red: Although less common, some sources mention that the plasmodium can occasionally appear red[6][9].

It's important to note that the color of Fuligo septica can vary slightly depending on environmental factors such as temperature, pH, and the substances it consumes[9]. The striking yellow color is due to the presence of a pigment that plays a role in forming chelates with heavy metals, which contributes to the organism's ability to accumulate and detoxify metals like zinc[7].

As the plasmodium progresses through its life cycle, its appearance changes. It typically starts as a bright yellow, slimy mass, then transforms into a more structured, cushion-like form (aethalium), and finally dries out and darkens before releasing its spores[1][4][10]. This color transformation, combined with its unusual texture, contributes to its common names like "dog vomit slime mold" and "scrambled egg slime mold"[8].
