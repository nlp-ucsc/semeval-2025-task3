The eldest son of Emperor Uda, who was the 59th Emperor of Japan, was originally named Prince Atsuhito (敦仁親王, Atsuhito-shinnō)[1][2]. He later became the 60th Emperor of Japan, known as Emperor Daigo (醍醐天皇, Daigo-tennō)[1][2].

Emperor Uda abdicated in 897 in favor of Prince Atsuhito, who then ascended the throne as Emperor Daigo[1][3]. Daigo was born on February 6, 885, in Kyoto and reigned from 897 to 930[8]. 

It's worth noting that Emperor Daigo's mother was Fujiwara no Taneko (also known as Inshi), who was the daughter of Fujiwara no Takafuji, the minister of the center[2]. However, since Daigo's mother died before his ascension to the throne, he was raised by another of Uda's consorts, Fujiwara no Onshi, daughter of the former kampaku Fujiwara no Mototsune[2].
