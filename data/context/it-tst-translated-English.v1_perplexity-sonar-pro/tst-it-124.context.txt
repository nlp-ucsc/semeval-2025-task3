The Cuban men's national volleyball team won the gold medal in the World Cup in 1989[1]. This was a significant achievement for the Cuban team, marking their first and only World Cup victory to date. The World Cup is one of the most prestigious international volleyball competitions, alongside the Olympics and the World Championship.

Some additional context about Cuba's performance in the World Cup:

1. Before their gold medal win, Cuba had achieved bronze in 1977 and silver in 1981, showing a steady improvement in their performance[1].

2. After their 1989 victory, Cuba continued to perform well in subsequent World Cups, securing silver medals in 1991 and 1999[1].

3. The 1989 World Cup victory was part of a golden era for Cuban volleyball, which included success in other major tournaments during the late 1980s and early 1990s.

4. One of the key players during this period was JoÃ«l Despaigne, who led the Cuban team to the gold medal at the 1989 FIVB World Cup in Japan[2]. Despaigne was considered one of the best volleyball players in the world at that time and was instrumental in Cuba's success.

This World Cup victory remains a highlight in the history of Cuban volleyball, showcasing the country's strength in the sport during that period.
