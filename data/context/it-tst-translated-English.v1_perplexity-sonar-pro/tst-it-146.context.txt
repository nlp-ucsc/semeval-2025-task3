The eye socket, also known as the bony orbit, has four walls and several borders. Here's a detailed breakdown:

## Walls of the Eye Socket

The eye socket has four main walls:

1. **Roof** (Superior Wall): 
   - Formed by the frontal bone and the lesser wing of the sphenoid[1][3].
   - Separates the orbit from the anterior cranial fossa[1].

2. **Floor** (Inferior Wall):
   - Composed of the maxilla, palatine, and zygomatic bones[1][3].
   - Separates the orbit from the underlying maxillary sinus[1].

3. **Medial Wall**:
   - Consists of the ethmoid, maxilla, lacrimal, and sphenoid bones[1][3].
   - The ethmoid bone separates the orbit from the ethmoid sinus[1].

4. **Lateral Wall**:
   - Formed by the zygomatic bone and greater wing of the sphenoid[1][3].
   - This is the thickest and strongest wall of the orbit[7].

## Borders of the Eye Socket

The eye socket also has several important borders:

1. **Apex**:
   - Located at the opening to the optic canal (optic foramen)[1][7].
   - Transmits the optic nerve and ophthalmic artery[7].

2. **Base** (Orbital Rim):
   - Opens out into the face and is bounded by the eyelids[1].
   - Also known as the orbital margin[7].
   - Has a quadrangular shape with the following borders:
     - Supra-orbital margin (superior): formed by the frontal bone
     - Medial margin: formed by the frontal process of the maxilla
     - Infra-orbital margin (inferior): formed by the zygomatic process of the maxilla and the zygomatic bone
     - Lateral margin: formed by the zygomatic process of the frontal bone and the zygomatic bone[7]

The eye socket is a complex structure composed of seven bones in total: frontal, sphenoid, maxillary, zygomatic, palatine, ethmoid, and lacrimal[3][4]. This bony structure provides crucial protection for the eyeball and associated structures, while also serving as an anchor point for muscles and allowing passage for important nerves and blood vessels[3].
