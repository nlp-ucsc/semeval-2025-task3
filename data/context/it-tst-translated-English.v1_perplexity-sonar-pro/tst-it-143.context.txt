The inhabitants of Formentera are called Formenterans or Formenterencs[1][2]. More specifically:

- In English, they are referred to as Formenterans.
- In Catalan (the official language of the island), they are called Formenterencs.
- In Spanish, they are known as Formenterenses.

The local population of Formentera is relatively small, with the island having 11,981 inhabitants as of January 1, 2021[1]. The people of Formentera have a distinct cultural identity shaped by the island's unique history and geography:

1. Language: While Spanish is widely spoken, the official language is Catalan. Locals often speak a dialect of Catalan called 'pag√®s'[7].

2. Historical influences: The island's population has been shaped by various cultures throughout history, including Carthaginians, Romans, Moors, and Catalans[4].

3. Way of life: Formenterans traditionally lived off agriculture, fishing, and salt production before the rise of tourism[4].

4. Cultural values: The inhabitants are known for valuing personal freedom and have historically resisted outside domination, as evidenced by their resentment of the 700 years of Majorcan control[5].

5. Modern identity: Today, while maintaining their traditional roots, Formenterans are also part of a community that caters to a significant tourist population, especially during the summer months[6].

It's worth noting that the current population of Formentera includes both native Formenterans and people who have moved to the island from other parts of Spain and around the world, contributing to a diverse yet close-knit island community.
