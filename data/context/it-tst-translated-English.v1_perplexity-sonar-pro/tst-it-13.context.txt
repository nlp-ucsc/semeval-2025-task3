Richard Layard, Baron Layard, co-founded the Action for Happiness movement in 2010 along with Sir Anthony Seldon, Sir Geoff Mulgan, and Dr. Mark Williamson[1][2][5].

Sir Anthony Seldon was the Vice-Chancellor of Buckingham University and previously the Master of Wellington College, where he introduced well-being classes[5]. Sir Geoff Mulgan was the CEO of NESTA and previously the CEO of the Young Foundation[5]. Dr. Mark Williamson has been the Director of Action for Happiness since its inception and has overall strategic and operational responsibility for the organization[8].

The movement was initially created and incubated within The Young Foundation before becoming an independent registered charity in January 2018[2]. Action for Happiness aims to increase happiness in the world by bringing people together and supporting them to take practical action to build a happier society[2]. The organization has no religious, political, or commercial affiliations and welcomes people of all faiths or none[1].

Since its founding, Action for Happiness has grown into a global movement with over 270,000 members in 190 countries[2]. The Dalai Lama serves as the patron of the organization[2][5].
