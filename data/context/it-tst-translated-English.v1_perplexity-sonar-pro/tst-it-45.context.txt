I apologize, but I don't have any specific information about who dubbed Alan Rachins in Italian for the film "Un fantasma per amico" (known in English as "Heart Condition"). The search results provided do not contain any details about the Italian dubbing cast for this movie. 

Without access to reliable sources about the Italian voice actors for this particular film, I cannot provide an accurate answer to your query. Voice acting and dubbing information for international releases of films is often not widely documented, especially for older movies.

If you're interested in finding this information, you might consider:

1. Checking Italian movie databases or dubbing-specific websites
2. Looking for the Italian DVD or Blu-ray release, which might list dubbing credits
3. Contacting Italian film archives or dubbing studios that might have records from that time

I apologize that I couldn't provide a more helpful answer based on the available information.
