The body color of Pseudomugil gertrudae, commonly known as the Spotted Blue Eye, is typically a semi-transparent silvery-blue or blueish-silver[1][5]. However, there is some variation in coloration across different populations:

- The fish often displays a radiant golden-yellow sheen over its silvery-blue base color[1].
- Some descriptions note a grayish-silver body color, which can also appear turquoise[4].
- The head and belly may have yellow-orange tones[4].
- Some populations, like those from the Aru Islands, have an overall golden color on both the body and fins[5].
- Fish from the Goanna Lagoon in Arnhem Land are noted to have golden body colors[5].

It's important to note that the body is moderately compressed and elongated, with a semi-transparent quality that allows the swim bladder to be visible[1][5]. The fish's appearance is further enhanced by:

- A latticework pattern formed by black-edged scales[5].
- Several rows of spots on the body scales, forming about 6 rows of discontinuous lines[5].
- A mid-lateral stripe that tends to be continuous from just below the origin of the first dorsal fin to the caudal peduncle[5].

The overall coloration and pattern can vary between populations and even change in individual fish over time[5]. This variability in body color and pattern contributes to the unique and attractive appearance of Pseudomugil gertrudae.
