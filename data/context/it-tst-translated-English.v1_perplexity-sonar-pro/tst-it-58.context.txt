In 1740, Carlo Gozzi was living in Dalmatia, where he had volunteered for military service. Specifically:

Carlo Gozzi volunteered in 1740 for the military forces of Girolamo Querini, who was the Provveditore Generale (Governor General) for Dalmatia and Albania along the west coast of the Balkan Peninsula[4]. He spent about three years in this military service in the Dalmatia region[1][3].

During his time in Dalmatia, Gozzi:

1. Performed as a member of a nonprofessional impromptu theatre company of male actors, playing the part of the soubrette[4].

2. Often had his comedy talents excuse him from regular military duties[4].

3. Gained experience that would later influence his theatrical works and defense of traditional Italian commedia dell'arte[3].

Gozzi returned to Venice in 1744 after completing his three-year period of military service[3][7]. This military experience in Dalmatia was a formative period for the young Gozzi, occurring when he was around 20 years old, and likely contributed to his later literary and theatrical pursuits.
