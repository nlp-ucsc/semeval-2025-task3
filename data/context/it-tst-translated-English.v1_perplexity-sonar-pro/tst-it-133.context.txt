The SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) string for bombykol is:

CCC/C=C\C=C\CCCCCCCCCO

This SMILES string represents the chemical structure of bombykol, which is a pheromone produced by female silkworm moths (Bombyx mori) to attract mates[1][7]. Let's break down the SMILES string to understand its components:

1. CCC - represents the first three carbon atoms in the chain
2. /C=C\ - indicates a trans (E) double bond
3. C=C\ - represents a cis (Z) double bond
4. CCCCCCCCCO - the remaining carbon chain ending with an alcohol (OH) group

Bombykol's full chemical name is (10E,12Z)-hexadeca-10,12-dien-1-ol, which aligns with this SMILES representation[6]. The molecule has 16 carbon atoms (hexadeca-) with two double bonds at positions 10 and 12, and an alcohol group (-ol) at position 1.

It's worth noting that there are alternative SMILES representations for bombykol that are also correct. For example, the canonical SMILES provided by some sources is:

OCCCCCCCCCC=CC=CCCC

This representation is equivalent to the first one but starts from the alcohol end of the molecule[7]. Both accurately describe the same chemical structure of bombykol.
