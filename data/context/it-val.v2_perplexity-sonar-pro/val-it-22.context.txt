Chris Claremont wrote the series "Prudence & Caution" for Defiant Comics in 1994[3][7]. This series was a monthly comic book that only ran for two issues, published in May and June of 1994, before Defiant ceased publication[3].

Some key details about "Prudence & Caution":

1. The main characters, Prudence and Rick (Caution), were originally created by Jim Shooter and first appeared in Defiant's "Warriors of Plasm" series[3].

2. While Shooter created the characters, Chris Claremont wrote the "Prudence & Caution" comic series[3].

3. The artist for the series was Jim Fern, whose quirky style complemented the offbeat nature of the stories[3].

4. The series presented Prudence and Caution as an unlikely duo, using their contrasting personalities to create interesting and humorous storylines[3].

5. Although only two issues were published, several more were solicited to vendors, leading to rumors of additional issues existing[3].

6. The series was cut short due to low sales in the comic book industry and Defiant's financial difficulties[3].

This short-lived series represents an interesting footnote in Claremont's extensive comic writing career, showcasing his work outside of his well-known Marvel Comics contributions, particularly his long run on X-Men titles[2][6].
