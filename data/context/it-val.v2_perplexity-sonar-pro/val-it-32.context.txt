Ted Lange participated in 250 episodes of The Love Boat series[3]. He played the role of Isaac Washington, the ship's bartender, for the entire run of the show from 1977 to 1986[1][3]. Lange was one of only three cast members, along with Gavin MacLeod and Bernie Kopell, to appear in every episode of the series[3]. 

The Love Boat aired for 9 seasons, with a total of 250 episodes produced[3]. Lange's character Isaac Washington was a main cast member throughout the show's entire run, appearing consistently across all seasons[3][7]. 

In addition to his acting role, Lange also directed and wrote several episodes of The Love Boat during its run[7]. His involvement with the series extended beyond just appearing on screen, as he took an active role behind the scenes as well.

Lange's portrayal of Isaac Washington became iconic, and he reprised the role in spin-offs and reunions even after the original series ended. For example, he directed two episodes of the 1999 series Love Boat: The Next Wave[7], and made an appearance in the first episode of the 2022 reality show The Real Love Boat[9].
