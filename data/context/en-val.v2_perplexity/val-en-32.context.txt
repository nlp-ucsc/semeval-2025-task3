No, Windows Neptune was never released. It was a version of Microsoft Windows that was under development in 1999 and early 2000, but it was canceled before its release. The project was merged with the Odyssey project, and the combined team worked on a new project codenamed Whistler, which eventually became Windows XP[1][3][4].

Despite its cancellation, Neptune's features and concepts influenced later versions of Windows. For example, the Activity Centers, a new task-based user interface, and the improved user management features were initially part of Neptune but were later integrated into other versions of Windows, such as Windows XP[1][3][4].
