Captain Morgan rum was first introduced in 1944 by the Seagram Company, a Canadian multinational company[1][4][5]. The brand was named after Sir Henry Morgan, a 17th-century Welsh privateer, and it has since become one of the top-selling rum brands globally. Initially, the rum was produced in Jamaica, but production was later shifted to Puerto Rico and eventually to the U.S. Virgin Islands[2][3][5].
