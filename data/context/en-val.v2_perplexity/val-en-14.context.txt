The Bleeding Kansas civil confrontations took place from 1854 to 1861. This period was marked by a series of violent conflicts between pro-slavery and anti-slavery groups in the Kansas Territory and neighboring Missouri, resulting from the debate over whether Kansas would enter the Union as a slave state or a free state[1][4]. The violence escalated immediately after the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in May 1854 and continued until Kansas was admitted to the Union as a free state on January 29, 1861[1][4].
