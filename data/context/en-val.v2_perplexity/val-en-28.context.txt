The first physician to study and define cerebral palsy was Dr. William John Little. He began his research in the 1830s and made significant contributions to understanding the condition, particularly in his lectures and publications starting from the 1840s. Dr. Little's work laid the foundation for later researchers and clinicians who continued to study and treat cerebral palsy[1][2][5].

However, it was Dr. Little who first identified and described the condition, which was initially referred to as "Little's Disease" or "cerebral paralysis." His research and lectures, including those at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in London, provided early insights into the condition's causes and symptoms[1][3][5]. The term "cerebral palsy" was later coined by Sir William Osler in 1887, but Dr. Little's work was instrumental in establishing the field of study for this condition[1][3].
