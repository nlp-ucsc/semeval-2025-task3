3. **Ningbo Style**: Specializing in seafood, with an emphasis on freshness and salty dishes. Ningbo cuisine retains original freshness, tenderness, and softness through techniques like quick-frying, stir-frying, deep-frying, simmering, and steaming[1][2][3].

4. **Wenzhou Style (Ou Cuisine)**: Known for delicious seafood and light, delicious dishes. Wenzhou style is characterized by its proximity to Fujian Province and is often included as a separate subdivision due to its unique flavor profile[1][2][3].
