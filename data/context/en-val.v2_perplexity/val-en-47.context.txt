Bischofsheim was a constituent community of Mainz from 1930 to 1945[2]. During this period, the station was renamed Mainz-Bischofsheim, reflecting its status as a district of the city of Mainz[2]. After World War II, Bischofsheim was transferred to American administration and later became a self-governing municipality again, but the station retained its name Mainz-Bischofsheim[2].
