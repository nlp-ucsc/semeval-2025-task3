The Swedish Navy was founded in 1522, when King Gustav Vasa purchased a number of ships from the Hanseatic town of LÃ¼beck, marking the beginning of the modern Swedish Navy[1][2][3]. This event is often recorded as the birth of the current Swedish Navy. However, it is worth noting that there were earlier forms of naval organization in Sweden, dating back to the 9th to 14th centuries with the use of *ledungen*, combined rowing and sailing ships[1].
