Hamilton Academical F.C. play their home matches at New Douglas Park, which is located in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, Scotland. The stadium has a capacity of 6,018 and has been the home ground of the club since 2001[1][2][3]. It is currently known as ZLX Stadium, although it was previously known as SuperSeal Stadium following a naming rights sponsorship deal in 2016[4]. The stadium is close to the Burbank and Whitehill residential areas and is easily accessible by public transport, with Hamilton West Railway Station being just a few minutes' walk away[1][4].
