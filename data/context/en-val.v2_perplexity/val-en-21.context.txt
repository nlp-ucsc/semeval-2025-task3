Yes, kremlins and detinets are similar in the sense that both terms refer to fortified complexes or citadels in Russia. However, there are some nuances and historical contexts that distinguish them:

1. **General Term**: The term "kremlin" (Кремль, kreml’) is a general term for town and city citadels in Russia. It encompasses a wide range of fortified complexes, including those that were historically significant and those that have been preserved[2].

2. **Historical Context**: The term "detinets" (детинец) is specifically used to refer to the fortified complex in Veliky Novgorod, which is also known as the Novgorod Kremlin. This term was historically used to describe the citadel in Novgorod, emphasizing its unique role as a fortified ecclesiastical site[1][3].

3. **Structural and Architectural Differences**: While both kremlins and detinets are fortified complexes, the Novgorod Detinets has a distinct history and architectural style. It was initially an ecclesiastical site with the first bishop building the Cathedral of Holy Wisdom in 989. The fortifications were built in stages, with the first wooden palisade and earthen embankments dating back to 1044, and later stone walls and towers constructed in the 14th century[1][3].

4. **Preservation and Significance**: The Novgorod Detinets, as a specific example, has been preserved and is notable for its historical significance, including the oldest church building in Russia, the Cathedral of St. Sophia. It has undergone various reconstructions and restorations over the centuries, including significant work in the 1950s and 1960s[1][3].

In summary, while both kremlins and detinets refer to fortified complexes in Russia, the term "detinets" specifically refers to the Novgorod citadel, which has a unique historical and architectural context.
