No, not all arthropods have antennae. There are exceptions within the arthropod group.

1. **Chelicerates**: This group includes spiders, mites, and their relatives. They do not have antennae[4][5].
2. **Proturans**: These arthropods also lack antennae[1].
3. **Some larval forms**: While most adult arthropods have antennae, some larval forms may have reduced or modified antennae, such as the nauplius larvae of crustaceans which use their antennae for swimming[1].

However, the majority of non-crustacean arthropods do have a single pair of antennae[1]. Crustaceans, on the other hand, have two pairs of antennae: primary antennae (antennules) and secondary antennae[1].
