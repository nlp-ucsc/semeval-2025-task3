Yes, the Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI) is still maintained. It is part of the Web of Science Core Collection, which includes the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), and Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI). Clarivate Analytics, the current publisher, has announced that all journals in the Web of Science Core Collection, including those in AHCI, will receive a Journal Impact Factor starting with the 2023 release[2][4].

The AHCI continues to cover a wide range of disciplines in the arts and humanities, including archaeology, art, architecture, Asian studies, classics, dance, folklore, history, language, linguistics, literary reviews, literature, music, philosophy, poetry, radio, television, film, religion, and theater[1][3][5]. It provides comprehensive indexing and abstracting services for over 1,700 arts and humanities academic journals, with coverage dating back to 1975[5]. The database is accessible through Web of Science and includes various types of content such as articles, letters, editorials, meeting abstracts, errata, poems, short stories, plays, music scores, excerpts from books, chronologies, bibliographies, and filmographies[5].
