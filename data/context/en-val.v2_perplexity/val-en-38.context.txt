In Bruce Sterling's "Schismatrix," the two main factions are the **Shapers** and the **Mechanists**. Here is a detailed description of each faction:

### Shapers
- **Philosophy**: The Shapers aim to enhance humanity through biogenetic engineering and psychotechnic training. They strive for an idealized human form and believe in the potential of genetic modifications to reshape humanity.
- **Technologies**: Shapers use advanced genetic engineering to create superior beings. They can change their mode of consciousness at will, which allows them to free themselves from emotional baggage and enhance their analytical acumen[1][2].
- **Society**: Shaper society is often aristocratic, with a strong emphasis on genetic heritage. They spend significant resources on rejuvenation therapies to combat aging[1][2].

### Mechanists
- **Philosophy**: The Mechanists seek to augment human capabilities through technology, relying on machinery and medical advancements to conquer human limitations. They believe in the potential of technology to perfect humanity.
- **Technologies**: Mechanists use advanced prosthetics and cyborg technology to extend their lives and enhance their abilities. They have two notable subgroups: "Lobsters," who permanently seal their bodies into life-support shells for deep space work, and "Wireheads," who leave their bodies behind to live as computer simulations[1][2].
- **Society**: Mechanist society is often characterized by ancient aristocrats who have extended their lives with advanced technology. They view the Shapers as unnatural abominations, leading to a deep-seated conflict between the two factions[1][5].

These two factions are central to the conflict and world-building in "Schismatrix," representing fundamentally different approaches to human evolution and enhancement.
