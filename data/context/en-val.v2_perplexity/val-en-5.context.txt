The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) defines a sustainable city as one that is inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. This definition encompasses several key aspects:

1. **Inclusivity**: Ensuring that all members of the community have access to basic services and opportunities, regardless of their socio-economic status or other factors[1][3][5].

2. **Safety**: Providing a secure environment for all residents, with measures to reduce crime and ensure public safety[1][3][5].

3. **Resilience**: Building the capacity of cities to withstand and recover from natural disasters, social unrest, and economic shocks[1][2][3].

4. **Sustainability**: Managing urban development in a way that minimizes environmental impacts, such as reducing carbon emissions, improving waste management, and promoting green spaces[1][2][3].

Additionally, SDG 11 emphasizes the importance of sustainable transport systems, inclusive and sustainable urbanization, and the protection of cultural and natural heritage[1][3][5].

### Key Features of a Sustainable City
- **Environmental Consciousness**: Improving environmental impact by reducing carbon emissions, promoting green spaces, and enhancing waste management[2][3].
- **Resilience to Disasters**: Building capacity to withstand natural disasters and social unrest[1][3].
- **Inclusive Communities**: Ensuring access to basic services and opportunities for all members of the community[1][3][5].
- **Economic Activity**: Fostering economic activity and job generation through sustainable practices[2].

These elements collectively aim to create urban environments that are not only livable but also contribute to global sustainability goals.
