Yes, a Graphics Address Remapping Table (GART) is a type of Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU). The GART is specifically designed to manage memory access for graphics processing units (GPUs) by translating graphics controller addresses to physical addresses in system memory. This function is similar to that of an IOMMU, which maps device-visible virtual addresses to physical addresses, making it useful in virtualization and ensuring secure and efficient memory access for I/O devices, including GPUs[2][3][5]. 

In the context of AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port) systems, the GART plays a crucial role in translating linear virtual addresses used by the CPU into physical addresses that the GPU can access directly, thereby improving performance and reducing memory latency[3]. This functionality aligns with the broader role of IOMMUs in managing memory access for I/O devices.
