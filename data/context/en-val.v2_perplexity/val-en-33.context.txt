No, Chris Claremont is not the sole writer of the comic book storyline "Days of Future Past." He co-wrote the story with artist John Byrne. The storyline was featured in two issues of "The Uncanny X-Men" (issues #141 and #142) and is considered a classic in the X-Men canon[1][2]. The 2014 film adaptation, "X-Men: Days of Future Past," also took its name from this comic book storyline, but it was not written by Chris Claremont. The screenplay for the film was developed by Simon Kinberg, Matthew Vaughn, and others[5].
