A western oriole, specifically the Bullock's Oriole, is a medium-sized songbird. Here are its measurements:

- **Length**: 6.7-7.5 inches (17-19 cm) for both sexes[1][4].
- **Weight**: 1.0-1.5 ounces (29-43 grams) for both sexes[1].
- **Wingspan**: 12.2 inches (31 cm) for both sexes[1].

These dimensions make the Bullock's Oriole slightly larger than a Yellow Warbler and about the same size but slimmer than a Brewer's Blackbird[1].
