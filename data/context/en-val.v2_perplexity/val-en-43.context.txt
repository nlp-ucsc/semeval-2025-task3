In a caseâ€“control study, two groups are compared: the **case group** and the **control group**. The case group consists of individuals who possess the condition or attribute of interest (e.g., a disease), while the control group consists of individuals who do not have the condition or attribute of interest but are otherwise similar to the cases in terms of demographic and other relevant characteristics[3][4][5].
