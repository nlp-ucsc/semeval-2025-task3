There are three stages of labor in childbirth:

1. **First Stage of Labor**: This stage begins when labor starts and ends with full cervical dilation at 10 centimeters. It is further divided into two phases:
   - **Latent Phase**: Characterized by slow cervical dilation from 0 to 6 centimeters. Contractions are mild and may not be consistent.
   - **Active Phase**: Marked by strong, more frequent contractions that cause the cervix to dilate from 6 to 10 centimeters[1][2][3].

2. **Second Stage of Labor**: This stage commences with complete cervical dilation at 10 centimeters and ends with the delivery of the neonate. It involves the fetus descending into the vaginal canal and passing through the birth canal via the cardinal movements[1][2][3].

3. **Third Stage of Labor**: This stage begins after the baby is born and ends with the delivery of the placenta. It involves mild, less painful contractions that help move the placenta into the birth canal, followed by its expulsion[1][2][3].
