If today is October 14th and it is not a leap year, there are 58 days remaining until the end of the year. Here's the calculation:

1. **Days in October**: Since October 14th has already passed, we need to count the remaining days in October.
   - October has 31 days, and 14 days have already passed, so there are **17 days** remaining in October.

2. **Days in November**: 
   - November has 30 days.

3. **Days in December**:
   - December has 31 days.

Adding these together:
- **17 days** (remaining in October) + **30 days** (in November) + **31 days** (in December) = **78 days**.

Therefore, there are **78 days** remaining until the end of the year if today is October 14th and it is not a leap year[4].
