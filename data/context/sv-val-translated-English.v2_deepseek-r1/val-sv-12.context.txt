Yes, coastal artillery continues to be a part of modern military forces, although its role and form have evolved significantly since its heyday in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Here are some key points about the current status:

1. **Evolution of Technology**: With advancements in missile technology, naval aviation, and precision-guided weapons, traditional coastal artillery systems (like large-caliber guns) have largely been replaced. Modern coastal defense systems now rely more on anti-ship missiles, radar systems, and integrated air defenses.

2. **Missile-Based Systems**: Many countries have adopted mobile missile systems for coastal defense. For example, Russia's Bal-E and Bastion-P systems, China's YJ-18 and YJ-21 missiles, and the U.S. Navy's Harpoon and Tomahawk missiles are used for maritime defense.

3. **Multi-Domain Integration**: Modern coastal defense is integrated with other military domains, including air, land, and cyber. This means that coastal artillery now works in conjunction with air defense systems, submarines, and surveillance networks to provide a layered defense.

4. **Legacy Systems in Some Nations**: Some smaller nations or those with limited defense budgets may still maintain older coastal artillery systems, either due to cost considerations or strategic necessity. These might include towed guns, fixed emplacements, or older missile systems.

5. **Asymmetric Warfare and Terror Threats**: There is also a focus on defending against asymmetric threats, such as fast attack craft or terrorists using small boats. This has led to the development of rapid-reaction systems, including auto-cannons and short-range missiles.

6. **Training and Exercises**: Many navies still conduct exercises that involve coastal defense scenarios, indicating that the concept remains relevant. For instance, some naval exercises include simulated attacks on coastal targets or defense against amphibious landings.

7. **Historical Preservation**: Many historical coastal artillery sites have been preserved as museums or tourist attractions, serving as reminders of past military strategies and technologies.

8. **Emerging Technologies**: The future of coastal defense might involve advanced technologies like hypersonic missiles, directed energy weapons (e.g., lasers), and unmanned systems (e.g., drones and unmanned patrol boats).

In summary, while traditional coastal artillery is less prominent, the concept of coastal defense remains integral to national security strategies. It has adapted to modern threats and technologies, incorporating a mix of missiles, electronics, and multi-domain capabilities.
