Predatory birds, commonly known as raptors, are characterized by several distinct features that enable them to hunt and kill their prey efficiently. Here are the key characteristics that distinguish them:

1. **Sharp, Hooked Beak (Rostrum):** Predatory birds have a distinctive curved beak that is sharp and hooked. This allows them to tear flesh and break bones of their prey effectively.

2. **Talons (Claws):** Raptors possess strong, sharp, and curved talons on their feet, which they use to grasp, kill, and carry their prey. These talons are often zygodactylous, meaning two toes point forward and two backward, providing a firm grip.

3. **Exceptional Eyesight:** Predatory birds have highly developed eyesight, often 4 to 8 times stronger than human vision. This allows them to spot prey from great distances. Some, like eagles and hawks, can see into the ultraviolet spectrum, aiding in hunting.

4. **Powerful Legs and Muscles:** Strong, muscular legs are essential for raptors to exert the force needed to grab and hold onto struggling prey. This is also crucial for the kill strike.

5. **Aerodynamic Bodies:** Raptors generally have sleek, streamlined bodies that reduce air resistance, enabling them to fly swiftly and engage in hovering or diving maneuvers when hunting.

6. **Feathers Adapted for Stealth and Speed:** Their feathers are often sleek and can be adjusted to reduce noise during flight, aiding in ambush tactics. Contour feathers may be soft under the wings to muffle sound, making them silent hunters.

7. **Keen Hearing and Smell:** While vision is their primary sense, many raptors also possess acute hearing and, in some cases, a developed sense of smell, which assists in locating prey.

8. **Intelligence:** Many predatory birds are highly intelligent, capable of complex behaviors such as strategic hunting, problem-solving, and memory of hunting grounds and caches.

These features collectively make predatory birds highly efficient hunters, capable of thriving in diverse environments around the world.
