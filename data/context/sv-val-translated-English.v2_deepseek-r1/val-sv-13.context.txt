The name "Galicia" originates from the ancient Celtic tribe known as the Gallaeci, who inhabited the region in what is now northwest Spain and northern Portugal during the pre-Roman and Roman periods. The Romans referred to the area as Gallaecia, which they later Latinized. Over time, the name evolved into "Galicia" in Spanish and Portuguese, and "Galiza" in the Galician language. This historical linguistic evolution reflects the region's rich Celtic and Roman heritage.
