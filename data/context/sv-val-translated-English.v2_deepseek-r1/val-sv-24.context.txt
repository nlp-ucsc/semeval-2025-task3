As of my last update in July 2024, I don't have access to real-time data or specific statistics about the population density of General Pinedo, Argentina. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking the latest census data or official sources such as the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INDEC) of Argentina or local government publications.
