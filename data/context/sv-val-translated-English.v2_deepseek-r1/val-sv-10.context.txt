I'm unable to provide the exact population of Bischofsheim in 2022 as I don't have access to that specific data. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking the latest figures from the German Federal Statistical Office (Deutsche Bundesamt f√ºr Statistik) or the official website of Bischofsheim. Additionally, local government resources or recent publications may also offer the information you're seeking.
