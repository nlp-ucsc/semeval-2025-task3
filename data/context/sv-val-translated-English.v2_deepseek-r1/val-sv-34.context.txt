Type 2 diabetes can cause a variety of symptoms, some of which may be subtle or develop gradually over time. Common symptoms include increased thirst and frequent urination, as high blood sugar levels lead to excess glucose in the urine, which pulls water with it, resulting in more trips to the bathroom and dehydration. Fatigue is another common symptom, as the body's cells are not getting the glucose they need for energy.

Blurred vision can occur when high blood sugar affects the lenses of the eyes. Hunger or increased appetite may also be present, despite eating, because the body isn't effectively using glucose for energy. Slow healing of cuts or wounds and frequent infections are additional symptoms, as high blood glucose can affect blood flow and the ability of the immune system to fight off infections.

 Tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, known as neuropathy, can develop when high blood sugar damages nerve endings. Unexplained weight loss, despite eating more, can happen if the body starts breaking down muscle and fat for energy due to insufficient insulin. Frequent yeast infections, especially in women, can occur because excess glucose in the urine and sweat provides a breeding ground for yeast. Lastly, darkened skin patches, particularly in the armpits, neck, and groin, known as acanthosis nigricans, can be a sign of insulin resistance.

It's important to note that some people with type 2 diabetes may not experience symptoms in the early stages, but over time, untreated diabetes can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, kidney damage, and vision problems. If you suspect you have diabetes, it's crucial to consult a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and management.
