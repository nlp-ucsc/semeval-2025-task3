The average pregnancy in humans, also known as gestation, typically lasts about 40 weeks. This period is counted from the first day of the woman's last menstrual period (LMP) to the day of delivery. However, it's important to note that only about 5% of babies are born exactly at 40 weeks. Most babies are born between 37 and 42 weeks of gestation. A pregnancy that lasts fewer than 37 weeks is considered preterm, and one that goes beyond 42 weeks is considered post-term.
