In the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, the spiritual leader is known as the **Sakya Trinzin**. The title "Trinzin" means "holder of the throne," signifying the leader's role in upholding the lineage and teachings of the Sakya tradition. The Sakya Trinzin is the head of the Sakya lineage, which is one of the four main schools of Tibetan Buddhism.
