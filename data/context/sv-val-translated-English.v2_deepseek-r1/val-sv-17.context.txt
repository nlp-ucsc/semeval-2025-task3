At the 1991 Biathlon World Championships, the women's relay event featured the Norwegian team consisting of Anne Elvebakk, Grete Ingeborg Nykkelmo, and Elin Kristiansen. Unfortunately, I don't have access to specific medal details from those Championships. For the most accurate information, I recommend checking historical records or official biathlon databases.
