The jungle oriole, specifically the *Symes's oriole*, has a black-colored beak. Oriole beaks are typically sturdy and pointed, well-suited for their diet which often includes insects, fruits, and nectar. If you're referring to a different species of oriole, the beak color might vary slightly, but many orioles share this black beak characteristic.
