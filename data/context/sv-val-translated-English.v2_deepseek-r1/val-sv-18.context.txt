The Roman city of Lugdunum, which is now modern-day Lyon, France, was founded in 43 BCE. It was established by Lucius Munatius Plancus, a Roman governor, under the authority of Emperor Claudius. The city became an important center for Roman administration, culture, and trade in Gaul (ancient France).
