Cerebral palsy (CP) is typically associated with brain injuries or developmental issues that occur before, during, or shortly after birth, up to the age of 3. It is most commonly diagnosed in early childhood, usually by the age of 2. However, symptoms might become more apparent as the child grows and reaches certain developmental milestones. In some cases, CP may not be diagnosed until later in childhood.
