Iran first participated in the Olympic Games in 1900[3][1]. However, this participation was not as an official team. In 1900, Iran (then known as Persia) was represented by a single athlete, Prince Freydoun Malkom, who competed in fencing[1][2].

Iran's first official participation as a team in the Summer Olympics was in 1948[1][3]. This came after the establishment of Iran's National Olympic Committee in 1947, which was recognized by the International Olympic Committee in the same year[1][8].

Regarding Winter Olympics, Iran made its debut in 1956[1][7]. Since then, Iran has participated in several Winter Olympic Games, focusing primarily on skiing events[2][7].

It's worth noting that while Iran has consistently participated in the Summer Olympics since 1948, they did miss two Summer Games in 1980 and 1984 due to political boycotts[1][3].
