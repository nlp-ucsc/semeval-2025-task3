According to the most recent information available, Iran has 26 wetlands that have been designated as Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar Sites) under the Ramsar Convention[1][10].

Key details about Iran's Ramsar sites:

1. The total surface area of Iran's Ramsar sites is 1,488,624 hectares[1][3].

2. Iran was one of the original signatories of the Ramsar Convention, which was signed in the Iranian city of Ramsar in 1971[3].

3. Some of Iran's notable Ramsar sites include:
   - Lake Urmia
   - Miankaleh Peninsula
   - Gorgan Bay
   - Shadegan Marshes
   - Neiriz Lakes & Kamjan Marshes[3]

4. The most recent addition to Iran's list of Ramsar sites is the Barm Alvan Wetland, which became the country's 26th designated site[10].

5. Iran's wetlands are crucial for biodiversity, especially as stopover sites for migratory birds. The country is located at the intersection of two main global bird migration routes[6].

6. While Iran has a significant number of internationally recognized wetlands, many of them face environmental challenges. About one-third of Iran's Ramsar sites are reported to be under pressure or in critical condition[7].

7. In total, Iran has over 100 wetlands covering approximately 3 million hectares of land, highlighting the country's rich wetland resources beyond just the Ramsar-designated sites[3].

The designation of 26 Ramsar sites demonstrates Iran's commitment to wetland conservation, though ongoing efforts are needed to protect and manage these important ecosystems effectively.
