The United States is the largest destination for Iranian immigrants[5][6]. According to data from the United Nations Population Division, the United States hosts the largest population of Iranians living abroad[5]. This is further supported by statistics showing that in 2019, the United States was home to 387,246 Iranian immigrants, ranking first among the top destination countries for Iranian immigrants[6].

Several factors contribute to the United States being the primary destination for Iranian immigrants:

1. Opportunities: The U.S. offers a wide range of opportunities in various fields, including education, business, and technology[2].

2. Strong Economy: As one of the largest economies in the world, the U.S. provides ample job prospects for immigrants[2].

3. Cultural Diversity: The United States is known for its multicultural society, which can be welcoming for people from diverse backgrounds[2].

4. Established Iranian Communities: Large Iranian communities, particularly in California, provide support networks for new immigrants[5].

5. Education: Many Iranians come to the U.S. for higher education opportunities[1].

Within the United States, the distribution of Iranian immigrants is not uniform:

- Over half of all Iranian immigrants in the U.S. live in California[5].
- More than one-third live in the Los Angeles metropolitan area alone[5].
- Other significant populations can be found in the Washington, DC, New York, and San Francisco metropolitan areas[5].

It's worth noting that while the U.S. remains the top destination, other countries also host significant Iranian immigrant populations. Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Turkey are among the other top destinations for Iranian immigrants[5][1]. However, the number of Iranian immigrants in these countries is considerably lower compared to the United States.
