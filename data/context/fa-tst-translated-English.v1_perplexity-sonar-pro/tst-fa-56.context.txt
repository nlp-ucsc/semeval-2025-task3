The Iranian volleyball team first achieved a position in the World Championship in 1970[7]. 

To provide more context:

1. Iran's volleyball journey began in 1921 when Mir Mehdi Varzandeh introduced the sport to the country[7].

2. The first Iranian Volleyball Championship was held in 1939[7].

3. After World War II, Iran started to engage in more international volleyball activities, including sending coaches and referees to international classes and inviting foreign teams[7].

4. Iran began participating in official international tournaments and competitions like the Asian Games, Asian Championships, and World Championships[7].

5. However, it wasn't until 1970 that Iran first qualified for and participated in the FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship[7].

6. Since then, Iran has made significant progress in international volleyball. For instance, in the 2014 World Championship, Iran finished in 6th place, which was a notable improvement from their earlier performances[3].

7. As of 2017, Iran was ranked 8th in the FIVB World Rankings and was considered the strongest team in Asia[1].

This progression demonstrates Iran's growing strength in international volleyball over the decades since their first World Championship appearance in 1970.
