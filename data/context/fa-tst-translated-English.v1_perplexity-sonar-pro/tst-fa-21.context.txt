Nowruz, the ancient celebration marking the Persian New Year and the arrival of spring, was inscribed on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2009[1][2][3][4]. This initial inscription included contributions from seven countries[8].

However, it's important to note that the recognition of Nowruz by UNESCO was extended in 2016[1][4]. This extension included additional countries, bringing the total number of participating nations to twelve. The countries that jointly inscribed Nowruz on the UNESCO list are Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, India, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan[1][4].

The inclusion of Nowruz on UNESCO's list acknowledges its significance as a cultural tradition that promotes peace, solidarity, and reconciliation. It also recognizes Nowruz's role in cultural diversity and friendship among peoples and different communities[1][4].

This UNESCO recognition has further elevated the status of Nowruz as an important cultural heritage, encouraging efforts to preserve and develop the traditions and cultures related to this ancient celebration[1]. It has also led to increased awareness and annual commemorative events in many countries where Nowruz is celebrated.
