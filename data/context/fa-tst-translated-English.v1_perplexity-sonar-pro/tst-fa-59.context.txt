Kimia Alizadeh became the first Iranian woman to win a medal at the Olympics[1][2]. She achieved this historic feat at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, where she won a bronze medal in the taekwondo 57 kg weight class[1].

Some key details about Kimia Alizadeh and her achievement:

1. Full name: Kimia Alizadeh Zonouzi (Persian: کیمیا علیزاده زنوزی)
2. Born: July 10, 1998, in Karaj, Iran
3. Sport: Taekwondo
4. Olympic achievement: Bronze medal in the 57 kg weight class at the 2016 Rio Olympics

Prior to her Olympic success, Alizadeh had already shown promise in taekwondo:

- She won a gold medal in the women's 63-kg class at the 2014 Youth Olympic Games in Nanjing[1].
- In 2015, she won a bronze medal at the World Taekwondo Championships, defeating Jade Jones, the gold medalist from the 2012 and 2016 Olympics[1].

Alizadeh's victory was significant not only for her personal achievement but also for women's sports in Iran. After the 1979 revolution, Iranian women were banned from participating in international sports competitions for over a decade[2]. Her medal win was celebrated in Iran, with President Hassan Rouhani congratulating her on the historic victory[2].

However, in January 2020, Alizadeh announced that she was leaving Iran permanently, citing oppression of women in the country[1]. She has since competed as part of the Refugee Olympic Team at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and now represents Bulgaria in international competitions[1][7].
