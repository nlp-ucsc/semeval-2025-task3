The Iranian national football team has qualified for the FIFA World Cup six times so far[1][2]. Here are the details of their World Cup appearances:

1. 1978 - Iran's first World Cup qualification
2. 1998 - Iran's second appearance, where they recorded their first World Cup victory
3. 2006
4. 2014
5. 2018
6. 2022

Iran's World Cup journey began in 1974 when they first participated in the qualifiers, but it wasn't until 1978 that they reached their first finals tournament[2]. In their debut World Cup appearance in 1978, Iran lost to the Netherlands and Peru but managed to hold Scotland to a 1-1 draw[2].

The 1998 World Cup was particularly significant for Iran as they recorded their first-ever World Cup victory, defeating the United States 2-1[2]. However, despite this historic win, Iran has never progressed beyond the group stages in any of their World Cup appearances[1].

It's worth noting that Iran's recent qualifications for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups marked the first time in their history that they qualified for two consecutive World Cup tournaments[4]. This achievement highlights the progress and consistency of the Iranian national team in recent years.

Currently, Iran is performing well in the qualifiers for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. As of the latest results, they are leading their qualification group with impressive performances, including a 4-1 victory over Qatar[3][5][9] and a 3-2 win against Kyrgyzstan[7]. These results suggest that Iran is in a strong position to potentially qualify for their seventh World Cup appearance in 2026.
