Traditional Iranian music, also known as Persian classical music, is based on a complex system of modes and melodies. Here's a detailed breakdown of the modes and songs in this musical tradition:

## Modes (Dastgāh and Āvāz)

The Iranian classical music system consists of:

1. Seven primary modes called **dastgāh**:
   - Shur
   - Mahur
   - Homayun
   - Nava
   - Segah
   - Chahargah
   - Rast-Panjgah[6]

2. Five secondary modes called **āvāz**, which are derived from the primary dastgāhs:
   - Abu-Ata
   - Bayat-e Tork
   - Afshari
   - Dashti
   - Esfahan[6]

These 12 modes (7 dastgāhs and 5 āvāz) comprise the entire "radif" or the collection of modes in Persian classical music[6].

## Melodic Motions (Gusheh)

Within these modes, there are more than 200 short melodic motions called **gusheh**[1][4]. These gushehs are the building blocks of Persian classical music compositions and improvisations.

## Historical Context

The system of modes in Persian music has a rich history:

1. Sasanian Era: The court musician Barbad is credited with organizing a musical system consisting of:
   - 7 "royal modes" (xosrovāni)
   - 30 derived modes (navā)
   - 360 melodies (dāstān)[1]

2. Safavid Empire: By the end of this era, more complex musical movements in 10, 14, and 16 beats ceased to be performed[1].

3. Qajar Era: The system was restructured, leading to the development of the current dastgāh system[1].

## UNESCO Recognition

The "Radif of Iranian music," which encompasses this entire repertoire of modes and melodies, was listed by UNESCO in 2009 as an element of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity[3].

In summary, traditional Iranian music is built upon a system of 12 modes (7 dastgāhs and 5 āvāz), which contain over 200 melodic motions (gusheh). This system evolved from earlier structures that included hundreds of melodies and dozens of modes, showcasing the rich and complex nature of Persian classical music.
