The Treaty of Turkmenchay was signed on February 10, 1828 (or February 22, 1828, according to some sources) between Qajar Iran and the Russian Empire[1][3][4]. This treaty concluded the Russo-Persian War of 1826-1828 and had significant territorial and political implications for both nations[4].

Key provisions of the Treaty of Turkmenchay included:

1. Territorial Cessions:
   - Iran ceded control of several areas in the South Caucasus to Russia, including the Erivan Khanate, the Nakhchivan Khanate, and the remainder of the Talysh Khanate[4].
   - The Aras River was established as the new border between Russia and Persia[3][4].

2. Financial Reparations:
   - Persia agreed to pay Russia 20 million silver rubles in reparations[4].

3. Maritime Rights:
   - Persian ships lost full rights to navigate the Caspian Sea and its coasts, which were given to Russia[4].

4. Diplomatic Privileges:
   - Russia gained the right to send consular envoys anywhere in Persia[4].
   - Russia was granted capitulation rights for its subjects in Persia[4].

5. Succession Support:
   - Russia promised to support Abbas Mirza as the heir to the throne of Persia upon the death of Shah Fath Ali (though this clause became moot when Abbas Mirza predeceased Shah Fath Ali)[4].

6. Population Movement:
   - Article 15 provided for the resettlement of Armenians from Iranian Azerbaijan to the Caucasus and included the liberation of Armenian captives taken by Persia since 1804 or 1795[4].
   - Inhabitants of the ceded regions were given the right to move from Persian districts to Russian districts within one year[4].

7. Amnesty:
   - Shah Fath Ali promised not to persecute any inhabitants or officials in the region of Iranian Azerbaijan for actions during the war or the temporary Russian occupation[4].

8. Commercial Agreements:
   - Both parties accepted commercial treaties with detailed conditions[4].

9. Prisoner Exchange:
   - Prisoners of war were to be exchanged[4].

The Treaty of Turkmenchay, along with the earlier Treaty of Gulistan (1813), solidified Russian control over the Caucasian territories formerly held by Iran, including present-day Armenia, Azerbaijan, and parts of northern Iran[4]. This treaty marked a significant shift in the balance of power in the region and had lasting impacts on the geopolitical landscape of the Caucasus.
