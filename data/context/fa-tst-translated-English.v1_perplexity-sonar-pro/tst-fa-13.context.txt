The Lut Desert, also known as Dasht-e Lut, in Iran is recorded as the hottest place on Earth[1][2][3]. This vast desert, located in southeastern Iran, has been measured to have the highest land surface temperatures ever recorded on our planet[4][6].

In 2005, NASA's Aqua satellite recorded a surface temperature of 70.7°C (159.3°F) in the Lut Desert, which remains the highest land surface temperature ever measured on Earth[1][2][7]. This extreme temperature was specifically recorded in an area of the desert called Gandom Beryan, a large plateau covered in dark lava[1][5].

Several factors contribute to the Lut Desert's extreme heat:

1. Geography: The desert covers an area of about 51,800 square kilometers (20,000 sq mi), making it Iran's largest desert after Dasht-e Kavir[1].

2. Climate: The region experiences an arid, subtropical climate with very little rainfall and low humidity[3].

3. Topography: The desert's low elevation, flat terrain, and lack of vegetation contribute to its ability to absorb and retain heat[3].

4. Solar radiation: Its location near the equator and lack of cloud cover result in intense solar radiation[3].

5. Atmospheric conditions: The lack of moisture and clouds allows heat to be trapped at the surface[3].

It's important to note that while the Lut Desert holds the record for the highest land surface temperature, air temperatures are typically lower, ranging from 45°C (113°F) to 55°C (131°F) in the daytime during summer[1]. Despite these extreme conditions, the desert is home to a variety of unique geological features and has been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site since 2016[1][10].
