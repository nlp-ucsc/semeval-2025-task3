The first Iranian film to win an award at the Cannes Film Festival was "Dawn of the Capricorn" (also known as "The Dawn of Capricorn") by Ahmad Farooqi Qajar in 1964[3]. This film competed in the short film category and won the "High Technical Council Award"[3].

It's worth noting that this was the first major recognition for Iranian cinema at Cannes, marking the beginning of Iran's presence on the international film festival circuit. After this initial success, it took nearly three decades before Iranian films began to consistently receive recognition at Cannes:

1. In 1992, Abbas Kiarostami's "Life and Nothing Else" won the "Best Film" award and the "Rossellini Award"[3].

2. In 1995, Jafar Panahi's "The White Balloon" received three awards: the "Golden Camera", the "Fipresci Prize", and "Best Film in the Fifteen Days of Directing" category[3].

3. A significant milestone came in 1997 when Abbas Kiarostami's "Taste of Cherry" won the prestigious Palme d'Or, sharing it with "The Eel" by Japanese director Shohei Imamura[3][10]. This marked the first time an Iranian film won Cannes' top prize.

Since then, Iranian cinema has continued to garner acclaim at Cannes and other international film festivals, with directors like Asghar Farhadi, Samira Makhmalbaf, and Mohammad Rasoulof receiving various awards and recognition for their work[1][2][4].
