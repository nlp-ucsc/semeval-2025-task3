The Nasta'liq script reached its peak during the Safavid Dynasty, particularly in the first half of the 16th century and early 17th century[7]. This period saw the refinement and perfection of the Nasta'liq style, which had been developing since its emergence in the 14th century.

Several key factors contributed to Nasta'liq's flourishing during this time:

1. Patronage: The Safavid rulers were great patrons of the arts, which led to the flourishing of calligraphy as a form of artistic expression[5].

2. Master Calligraphers: This era produced some of the most renowned calligraphers who brought Nasta'liq to its classical form. Notable masters include:

   - Mir Emad Hassani (c. 1554-1615 CE), whose style became the model for future generations[4][7].
   - Sultan 'Ali Mashhadi (d. 1520 CE), who composed an influential guide to writing Nasta'liq called "Sirat al-Sutur" (The Path of Writing) around 1514 CE[7].

3. Artistic Development: During this period, Nasta'liq evolved from a simple tool of writing poetry to a sophisticated expression of art[3]. The script was refined to achieve an impeccable elegance, balance, and beauty[7].

4. Cultural Significance: Nasta'liq became the preferred script for penning Persian poetry and other secular texts due to its bold yet elegant appearance[8]. It was widely adopted throughout the Persian-speaking world, from Turkey to India[3].

The peak of Nasta'liq's development is generally considered to be between 1400 and 1600 CE[3][10]. This timeframe encompasses the late Timurid and early Safavid periods, during which the script reached its highest level of sophistication and artistic merit.

It's worth noting that while the Safavid era marked the classical peak of Nasta'liq, the script continued to evolve and remained significant in later periods. For instance, in the 19th century, calligraphers like Mirza Mohammad Reza Kalhor (d. 1892) reintroduced a more compact style of Nasta'liq[4], demonstrating the script's ongoing development and importance in Persian culture.
