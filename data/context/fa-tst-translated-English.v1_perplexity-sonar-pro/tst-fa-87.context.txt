Based on the search results provided, the first specialized pharmaceutical town in Iran appears to be Barkat pharmaceutical town. This can be inferred from the following information:

Barkat pharmaceutical town is described as "a new industrial zone under construction" located "on the northern side of Tehran-Qazvin highway, close to the small town of Kordan and just an hour drive west of Tehran"[4]. 

The Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk chose this location to build its factory in Iran after signing a Memorandum of Understanding with the Iranian Food and Drug Administration. Specifically, the search results state:

"It was only a few months after the agreement with the Ministry of Health that Novo announced it had chosen a location to build its factory. Barkat pharmaceutical town, a new industrial zone under construction, is situated on the northern side of Tehran-Qazvin highway, close to the small town of Kordan and just an hour drive west of Tehran."[4]

The fact that a major international pharmaceutical company like Novo Nordisk selected this location for its manufacturing facility in Iran suggests that Barkat was being developed as a specialized zone for pharmaceutical production. The description of it as a "new industrial zone under construction" specifically for pharmaceutical manufacturing indicates it was likely the first of its kind in Iran.

However, it's worth noting that the search results do not explicitly state that Barkat was the very first specialized pharmaceutical town in Iran. The information provided suggests it was a new development at the time Novo Nordisk chose to build there, but does not rule out the possibility of earlier pharmaceutical industrial zones. To make a definitive claim, additional historical information about Iran's pharmaceutical industry development would be needed.
