The oldest known Iranian carpet, called the Pazyryk carpet, was discovered in 1949 in the Pazyryk Valley of the Altai Mountains in Siberia[1][2][3]. This remarkable find was made during an archaeological excavation of a Scythian burial mound, specifically in the grave of a Scythian nobleman[4][5].

The Pazyryk carpet is considered one of the oldest carpets in the world, dating back to the 4th-3rd centuries BC, making it approximately 2,500 years old[1][4]. Its preservation is attributed to a unique set of circumstances:

1. The carpet was buried in a tomb as part of the nobleman's possessions.
2. The tomb was robbed soon after the burial.
3. The thieves left a hole in the burial mound, which allowed water to enter.
4. The water subsequently froze, encasing the carpet in ice and preserving it for over two millennia[2].

This fortuitous series of events protected the carpet from decay, allowing it to survive in remarkably good condition until its discovery in the mid-20th century.

The Pazyryk carpet's origins are subject to debate among scholars. While it was found in a Scythian tomb, many experts attribute its creation to Persia (modern-day Iran) due to its sophisticated design and weaving techniques[2][3]. The carpet's intricate patterns, including horsemen, deer, and geometric designs, showcase a level of craftsmanship that suggests a well-developed weaving tradition[1][2].

Currently, this ancient treasure is housed in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia, where it continues to be studied and admired as a testament to the long and rich history of Persian carpet-making[4][5].
