The capital of the Parthian Empire changed over time, but Ctesiphon eventually became the main capital and most important city of the empire. Here's a detailed overview of the Parthian capitals:

1. Early Capitals:
- Nisa (also called Mithradatkert) was one of the earliest capitals, established around 250 BC[5]. It was located in modern-day Turkmenistan.
- Dara (modern Abivard) is mentioned as probably the earliest Parthian capital[4].
- Hecatompylos, likely near modern Dāmghān in Iran, served as one of the later capitals[4][10].

2. Shift to Ctesiphon:
- Ctesiphon, located on the eastern bank of the Tigris River about 35 km southeast of modern Baghdad, became the primary capital during the Parthian period[1][3].
- The exact date of Ctesiphon becoming the capital is not certain, but it likely occurred in stages:
  - It was founded in the late 120s BC[1].
  - It became a royal residence during the reign of Orodes II, around 58 BC[1].
  - Some sources suggest it may have become the official capital during the reign of Gotarzes I (c. 90–80 BC)[2].

3. Importance of Ctesiphon:
- Ctesiphon served as the winter residence for Parthian kings[3].
- It gradually merged with nearby cities, including the Hellenistic city of Seleucia, forming a large metropolitan area[1].
- The city became a rich commercial center and a cosmopolitan metropolis[1].
- Ctesiphon's strategic location on the Tigris River and the Silk Road contributed to its importance[2].

4. Reasons for Choosing Ctesiphon:
- Its western location made it a better administrative center for the expanding empire[1].
- The move westward may have been partly due to Scythian incursions near the earlier eastern capitals[1].
- Its position allowed better control over Mesopotamia and facilitated trade[7].

5. Continuity:
- Ctesiphon remained the capital during the subsequent Sasanian Empire, demonstrating its enduring strategic importance[1][3].

In summary, while the Parthians had several early capitals including Nisa, Dara, and Hecatompylos, Ctesiphon eventually emerged as the primary and most significant capital of the Parthian Empire, a status it maintained for centuries[1][2][3].
