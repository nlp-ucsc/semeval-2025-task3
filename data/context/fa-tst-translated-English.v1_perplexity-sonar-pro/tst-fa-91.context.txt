According to Transparency International's 2019 Corruption Perceptions Index, Iran ranked 146th out of 180 countries assessed[10]. Iran received a score of 26 out of 100 on the index, where 0 is highly corrupt and 100 is very clean[10]. This low score and ranking indicate that Iran was perceived to have very high levels of public sector corruption in 2019.

To provide some context:

1. Iran's score of 26 was well below the global average score of 43[7].

2. Iran shared its 146th place ranking with other countries like Mozambique and Nigeria, which also scored 26 points[10].

3. Iran's score placed it among the bottom quarter of countries assessed, indicating it was seen as one of the more corrupt nations globally in 2019.

4. For comparison, the top-performing countries in 2019 were Denmark and New Zealand with scores of 87, while the worst-performing was Somalia with a score of 9[7].

This ranking reflects the perception of Iran as a country with widespread corruption issues, particularly in its public sector. The low score suggests significant challenges with transparency, accountability, and integrity in government institutions and processes.
