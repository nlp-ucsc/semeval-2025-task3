According to the latest available data, the population density of Iran is approximately 54-56 people per square kilometer. Here are the key details:

1. The most recent official census data from 2016 indicated a population density of 49 people per square kilometer[4].

2. However, more recent estimates for 2024-2025 show an increase:

   - Worldometers estimates Iran's population density at 57 people per square kilometer as of 2025[2].
   - Countrymeters reports a population density of 54.0 people per square kilometer as of January 2025[7].
   - The World Bank reported Iran's population density at 55.18 people per square kilometer in 2022, which is likely to have increased slightly since then[8].

3. The total land area of Iran used in these calculations is consistently reported as approximately 1,628,550 square kilometers[2][6][7].

4. Iran's population has been growing steadily, with the latest estimates ranging from about 85 million to 91 million people[3][4].

5. The population is not evenly distributed across the country. Urban areas, particularly Tehran and other major cities, have much higher population densities compared to rural and less hospitable regions[6].

It's important to note that population density can vary slightly depending on the exact population estimate used and the precise measurement of land area. However, based on the most recent data, a population density of 54-56 people per square kilometer appears to be the most accurate range for Iran as of 2025.
