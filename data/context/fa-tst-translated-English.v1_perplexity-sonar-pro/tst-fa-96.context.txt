Based on the search results, the rate of land subsidence in Iran is significantly higher than in developed countries and the global average. Here are the key points:

1. Iran's land subsidence rate is 5 times the global average[9][10]. The average global land subsidence rate is about 3 centimeters per year, while in Iran it averages about 15 centimeters per year[10].

2. Some sources indicate an even more extreme difference, stating that Iran's land subsidence is 90 times higher than in developed countries[6].

3. In certain areas of Iran, the subsidence rate is alarmingly high:
   - In some regions, it reaches up to 35 centimeters per year[4][7].
   - In Kerman province, subsidence rates exceeding 35 centimeters per year have been measured in some locations[7].

4. Iran ranks among the countries with the highest land subsidence rates globally:
   - It has been reported as having the fourth-largest land subsidence in the world[6].
   - Other sources place Iran as the second worst globally for land subsidence, just behind India[1].

5. The extent of the problem is vast, with about 11% of Iran's land area (approximately 18.5 million hectares) at risk of land subsidence, affecting nearly 49% of Iran's population[1][9].

In conclusion, while the exact multiple varies depending on the source and specific regions being compared, it's clear that Iran's land subsidence rate is significantly higher than that of developed countries, ranging from 5 to 90 times greater, with some areas experiencing extreme rates far beyond global averages.
