Based on the search results provided, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact year for the first edition of Hafez's Divan. However, we can piece together some key information:

1. Hafez lived in the 14th century (1315-1390), and his Divan was likely compiled after his death[3].

2. The first compilation of Hafez's Divan was probably done by Mohammad Glendam after Hafez's death. There are some unconfirmed reports that Hafez may have published his own Divan in 770 AH (1368 CE), about 20 years before his death, but this is not widely accepted[3].

3. The earliest printed editions of Hafez's Divan appeared outside of Persia. The first printed edition using movable type was published by Upjohn's Calcutta press in 1791[1].

4. The first lithograph of the Divan to appear in Persia was a pocket edition dated 18th Moá¸¥arram 1254/13th April 1838[1].

5. Many early editions were published in India, Europe, and other parts of the world throughout the 19th century[1].

It's important to note that the concept of a "first edition" for Hafez's Divan is complex, as it existed in manuscript form for centuries before being printed. The earliest manuscripts date back to the early 15th century, not long after Hafez's death. For example, one manuscript mentioned in the search results is dated 813-14/1410-11[1].

In conclusion, while the original compilation of Hafez's Divan likely occurred in the late 14th or early 15th century, the first printed edition appeared in 1791 in Calcutta, and the first printed edition in Persia was in 1838. The exact date of the very first manuscript compilation remains uncertain.
