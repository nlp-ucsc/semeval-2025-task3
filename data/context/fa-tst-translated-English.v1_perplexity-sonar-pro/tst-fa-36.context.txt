Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, the fourth Shah of Qajar Iran, was assassinated during the Qajar era on May 1, 1896[1]. He had ruled Iran for nearly 51 years, from September 5, 1848, until his assassination. The assassination took place while Naser al-Din Shah was visiting and praying at the Shah Abdol-Azim Shrine in Rayy, near Tehran[1].

The assassin was Mirza Reza Kermani, a follower of Jam훮l al-D카n al-Afgh훮n카[1]. The assassination was carried out with a revolver, which was reportedly old and rusty. It is said that if the Shah had worn a thicker overcoat or been shot from a longer range, he might have survived the attempt on his life[1].

This assassination marked a significant turning point in Iranian political history. Shortly before his death, Naser al-Din Shah is reported to have said, "I will rule you differently if I survive!"[1] The assassination and the subsequent execution of Kermani led to changes in Iranian political thought that would ultimately contribute to the Iranian Constitutional Revolution during the reign of Naser al-Din Shah's successor, Mozzafar-al-Din Shah[1].

Naser al-Din Shah's assassination is considered the first modern political assassination in Iran during the Qajar era[4]. It set the stage for future political upheavals and marked the beginning of a tumultuous period in Iranian history that would eventually lead to the fall of the Qajar dynasty and the rise of the Pahlavi dynasty in the early 20th century.
