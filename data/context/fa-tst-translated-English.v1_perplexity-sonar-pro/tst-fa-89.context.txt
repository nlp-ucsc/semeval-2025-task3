Based on the search results provided, there is no definitive information on which specific ethnic group has conducted the most internal migration in Iran. However, I can provide some relevant insights on internal migration patterns in Iran:

Internal migration in Iran has been a significant demographic trend, particularly from rural areas to cities. This trend began in the 1960s and has continued since then[2]. Over the past four decades, on average about one million people have migrated annually across the country[9].

Several factors have contributed to internal migration in Iran:

1. Economic opportunities: The oil boom and urbanization have attracted people to cities in search of better employment prospects[7].

2. Political events: The 1979 Revolution and the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988) accelerated rural to urban migration[7].

3. Climate change: In recent years, environmental factors have become a driver of internal migration. In the past three decades, over 1 million people moved internally within Iran, resulting in a 5% decrease in the rural population between 1996 and 2011[7].

4. Development disparities: Some ethnic minority regions, such as Baluchistan, remain less developed and have high unemployment rates, which may contribute to out-migration[3].

While the search results don't specify which ethnic group has migrated the most internally, it's worth noting that Iran is home to several ethnic minorities, including Azeris, Kurds, Arabs, Baluchis, and Lors[1]. These groups may have different migration patterns based on their specific economic, social, and environmental circumstances.

Additionally, it's important to note that Iran also hosts a large population of Afghan refugees and migrants, with estimates ranging from 1.5 to 2 million undocumented Afghans living in the country[5]. While these are international migrants, their presence may influence internal migration patterns as well.

To determine which ethnic group has conducted the most internal migration in Iran, more specific demographic studies focusing on ethnic migration patterns would be necessary.
