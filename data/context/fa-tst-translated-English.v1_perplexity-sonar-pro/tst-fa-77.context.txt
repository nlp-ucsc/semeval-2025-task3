The construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant began in 1975[1][3][4][5]. Here are some key details about the start of construction:

1. Original German project:
- Construction was initially started in 1975 by German companies, specifically Kraftwerk Union AG (a Siemens subsidiary)[1][3][4].
- The original plan was for two 1,200 MW reactors[2][5].
- The project was commissioned by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi as part of his vision for a national electrical grid powered by nuclear plants[4].

2. Initial timeline:
- The completion date was originally set for 1981[5].
- However, the project faced significant delays and interruptions.

3. Early challenges:
- Construction was halted in 1979 following the Iranian Revolution[3][4].
- The site was damaged during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s[1][2].

4. Russian involvement:
- After years of being idle, Russia signed a contract in 1995 to complete the plant[2][3].
- This marked the restart of the project under Russian guidance.

It's worth noting that while 1975 marks the beginning of physical construction, the planning and contracting phase began slightly earlier. In August 1974, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi publicly announced his vision for nuclear power in Iran, which led to the Bushehr project[4].
