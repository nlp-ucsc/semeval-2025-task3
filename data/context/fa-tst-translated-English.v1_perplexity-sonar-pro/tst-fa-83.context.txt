Artificial intelligence became an academic discipline in 1956. This pivotal year marked the official birth of AI as a field of study, centered around the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence[1][5][6].

The Dartmouth workshop, organized by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon, took place in July and August of 1956 at Dartmouth College[2]. This event is widely considered the founding moment of AI as a formal academic discipline[5][7].

Key aspects of this foundational event include:

1. Coining of the term: John McCarthy introduced the term "artificial intelligence" in the proposal for this summer research project[2][5].

2. Interdisciplinary approach: The workshop brought together scientists from various fields, including mathematics, computer science, and psychology[5].

3. Ambitious goals: The organizers proposed that "every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it"[1].

4. Lasting impact: This event laid the groundwork for future AI research and established AI as a distinct field of study[6].

While the concept of intelligent machines had existed in various forms before 1956, including Alan Turing's influential work in 1950[1][3], the Dartmouth workshop formalized AI as an academic discipline and set the stage for decades of research and development in the field.
