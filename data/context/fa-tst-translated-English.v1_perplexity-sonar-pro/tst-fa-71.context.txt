The Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus) is widely recognized as a prominent symbol of Iran's wildlife[1][9]. This critically endangered subspecies of cheetah is now found only in Iran, making it a unique and important part of the country's natural heritage[10].

While Iran has several animal symbols rather than a single official national animal, the Asiatic cheetah holds a special place among them due to its rarity and conservation status. Other animal symbols of Iran include:

1. Asiatic lion: Historically significant and featured in Iranian iconography[1][7]
2. Persian leopard: Native to Iran and an important part of its ecosystem[5][9]
3. Persian fallow deer: An endangered species native to Iran[1][7]
4. Persian cat: Representing Iran's domestic animal heritage[1][7]

The Asiatic cheetah's importance is highlighted by its critically endangered status, with only a small population remaining in the wild. Conservation efforts in Iran focus on protecting this iconic species, which has become a flagship for the country's wildlife conservation initiatives[2].

Iran's diverse wildlife also includes other notable species such as:

- Persian onager (wild ass)
- Caspian seal
- Mugger crocodile (locally called Gando)
- Various bird species like the golden eagle and common nightingale (which is considered Iran's national bird)[9]

These animals collectively represent the rich biodiversity of Iran's various ecosystems, from its deserts and mountains to its coastal areas. The emphasis on the Asiatic cheetah and other rare species underscores Iran's commitment to preserving its unique wildlife heritage.
