Based on the provided search results, the largest age group in Iran's population is the working-age group, specifically those aged 15-64 years old.

As of 2023, approximately 69.8% of Iran's population falls within the 15-64 age range[2]. This is supported by multiple sources:

1. The World Factbook (CIA) data shows that the 15-64 age group makes up 69.8% of the total population as of 2024 estimates[2].

2. Statista reports that in 2023, about 69.25% of Iran's inhabitants were aged 15 to 64 years[4].

3. The Population Trends Asia Pacific data indicates that in 2023, the 15-64 age group comprises 61,362,000 people out of a total population of 89,173,000, which is about 68.8% of the population[10].

This large working-age population is part of what demographers call a "demographic window" or "demographic dividend," where the working-age population greatly outnumbers young and elderly dependents[1]. This favorable demographic structure is expected to last until sometime between 2040 and 2045, providing Iran with an opportunity to harness its human capital for economic growth[1].

It's worth noting that while this age group is currently the largest, Iran's population is aging. The median age of the Iranian population was 32 years as of January 2025[2], and projections suggest that the proportion of elderly (65 and over) will increase significantly in the coming decades[1][10].
