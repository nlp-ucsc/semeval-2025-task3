According to recent reports, the number of annual deaths in Iran attributed to air pollution is alarmingly high, with estimates ranging from 30,000 to 50,000 deaths per year.

The most recent and specific figure comes from the Iranian Ministry of Health. Abbas Shahsavani, head of the Air Health and Climate Change Group at Iran's Health Ministry, announced that based on monitoring a statistical population of 48 million people, 30,692 deaths were attributed to air pollution in the Iranian year 1402 (roughly March 2023-March 2024)[1][2]. This represents a 17% increase (4,385 more deaths) compared to the previous year.

Other sources provide slightly different but consistently high estimates:

- A study revealed that approximately 12% of deaths in Iran are attributed to air pollution, with about 50,000 deaths in Iran attributed to air pollution last year, out of an annual total of about 450,000 deaths from various causes[8].

- Another report states that an estimated 40,000 people fall victim each year due to air pollution in Iran[9].

- Some sources cite even higher figures, with one stating that approximately 50,000 Iranians died from air pollution in a recent year[4].

The economic impact of this crisis is also significant, with the Health Ministry estimating the cost of deaths attributed to air pollution last year at $12 billion[1][2].

The situation is particularly dire in major cities:

- In Tehran, one of the world's most polluted cities, over 4,000 people reportedly lose their lives annually due to air pollution[4].

- Only 12 days in Tehran – a mere 3% of the year – had safe levels of particulate matter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), a dangerous pollutant that can penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream[2].

These figures highlight the severe and ongoing air pollution crisis in Iran, which poses a significant threat to public health and requires urgent attention and action.
