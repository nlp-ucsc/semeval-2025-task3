No Iranian author has won the International Booker Prize yet. However, Shokoofeh Azar, an Iranian-Australian author, was shortlisted for the 2020 International Booker Prize for her novel "The Enlightenment of the Greengage Tree"[1][2]. This made her the first Iranian author to be nominated for this prestigious literary award[2].

Shokoofeh Azar was born in Iran in 1972 and worked as a journalist there before seeking political asylum in Australia in 2011[3]. She wrote "The Enlightenment of the Greengage Tree" in Farsi, and it was translated into English by an anonymous translator[2]. The novel is set in Iran during the decade following the 1979 Islamic Revolution and uses magical realism to tell its story[1][3].

Azar's nomination for the International Booker Prize was a significant achievement, as it brought attention to Iranian literature on the global stage. She expressed hope that her nomination would help draw attention to other literature translated from Farsi and to translated literature more broadly[1].

While Azar did not win the 2020 International Booker Prize, her shortlisting was a milestone for Iranian literature. The prize that year was awarded to Marieke Lucas Rijneveld for "The Discomfort of Evening"[6].
