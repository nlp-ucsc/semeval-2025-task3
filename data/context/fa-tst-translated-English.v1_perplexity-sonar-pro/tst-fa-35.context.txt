The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) was officially established by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in May 1979, shortly after the Iranian Revolution[1][3][4]. 

Specifically:

1. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Supreme Leader of Iran at the time, issued a decree on May 5, 1979 that formally established the IRGC[1][4].

2. The IRGC was created in the immediate aftermath of the 1979 Iranian Revolution that overthrew the Shah and established the Islamic Republic[1][3].

3. Khomeini's intention in creating the IRGC was to have a military force loyal to the new revolutionary government and Islamic system, as opposed to the regular army which was seen as potentially still loyal to the deposed Shah[1][4].

4. The IRGC was meant to protect the newly established Islamic Republic and revolutionary values, serving as a counterweight to the traditional armed forces[3][4].

While Khomeini is recognized as the official founder, it's worth noting that others were involved in the IRGC's early formation:

- Mohsen Sazegara claims to be one of the founders and was involved in drafting the IRGC's initial charter, though he left the organization soon after[10].

- Ayatollah Hassan Lahouti was reportedly ordered by Khomeini to begin collecting weapons from the public, which was one of the first steps in establishing the IRGC[10].

However, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini is widely and officially recognized as the founder of the IRGC, as he issued the decree that formally established it as an organization within the new Islamic Republic of Iran.
