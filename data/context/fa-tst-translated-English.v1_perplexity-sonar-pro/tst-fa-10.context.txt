The Karun River originates in the Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province and flows into the Khuzestan Province of Iran[1][2][3].

Specifically, the river's source is located in the Zagros Mountains, particularly in the Zard Kuh mountains of the Bakhtiari district[2]. It begins its journey in the heights of Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province, where several tributaries converge to form the main river[1][3].

From its mountainous origins, the Karun River flows southwestward, entering Khuzestan Province. As it travels through Khuzestan, it passes through several important cities:

1. Shushtar
2. Ahvaz (the capital of Khuzestan Province)
3. Khorramshahr

In Ahvaz, the river notably divides the city into two parts, with several bridges connecting the two sides[1][7].

As it approaches its final stretch, the Karun River divides into two main branches near Khorramshahr:

1. One branch flows into the Arvand Rud (also known as Shatt al-Arab)
2. The other branch continues towards the Persian Gulf[1][2]

Ultimately, the waters of the Karun River empty into the Persian Gulf, completing its journey from the mountainous regions of western Iran to the southwestern coastal areas[2][3].
