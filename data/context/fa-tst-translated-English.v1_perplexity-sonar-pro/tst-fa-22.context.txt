The Persian Garden was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011[1][4][7].

UNESCO added nine famous Persian gardens to its World Heritage list under the collective name "The Persian Garden" during the 35th session of the World Heritage Committee, which took place in Paris from June 19 to June 28, 2011[1][4].

These nine gardens, selected from various regions of Iran, represent the diversity of Persian garden designs that have evolved and adapted to different climatic conditions over centuries while retaining core principles dating back to the time of Cyrus the Great in the 6th century BC[4][9].

The inscribed Persian gardens include:

1. Pasargadae Garden in Pasargad County
2. Chehel Sotoun in Isfahan
3. Fin Garden in Kashan
4. Eram Garden in Shiraz
5. Shazdeh Garden in Mahan
6. Dowlatabad Garden in Yazd
7. Abbasabad Garden in Behshahr
8. Pahlavanpour Garden in Mehriz
9. Akbarieh Garden in Birjand[2]

These gardens were recognized by UNESCO for their outstanding universal value, meeting criteria (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), and (vi)[4]. They are considered masterpieces of human creative genius, showcasing an important interchange of human values, and bearing exceptional testimony to cultural traditions that have evolved in Iran and the Middle East over more than two millennia[9].
