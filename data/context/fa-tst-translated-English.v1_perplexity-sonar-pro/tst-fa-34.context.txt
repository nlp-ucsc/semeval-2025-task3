The first presidential election in Iran was held on January 25, 1980[2]. This election took place about one year after the Iranian Revolution, when the Council of the Islamic Revolution was in power. It marked the first time Iranians directly elected their president through popular vote. In this historic election, Abolhassan Banisadr emerged as the winner, securing 75.6% of the votes[2].

Some key details about this first presidential election:

- The voter turnout was 67.42%[2]
- 124 candidates initially registered to run, but only 96 were allowed to participate[2]
