The Pahlavi dynasty was established following the 1921 coup d'état in Iran. This coup marked the beginning of the end for the Qajar dynasty and paved the way for the rise of Reza Khan, who would later become Reza Shah Pahlavi, the founder of the Pahlavi dynasty[1][2].

Key events in the establishment of the Pahlavi dynasty:

1. On February 21, 1921, Reza Khan, a 42-year-old soldier, led a military coup in Tehran with about 1,200 men of the Persian Cossack Brigade[1][2].

2. Initially, Reza Khan became the war minister in the new government formed after the coup, while a young journalist named Sayyid Zia al-Din Tabatabaʾi became prime minister[2].

3. Over the next few years, Reza Khan consolidated his power, becoming prime minister in 1923[2].

4. In 1925, the Iranian parliament (Majles) deposed Ahmad Shah Qajar, the last ruler of the Qajar dynasty, who had been absent from the country[1][2].

5. On December 12, 1925, the Majles, convening as a Constituent Assembly, formally declared Reza Khan as the new Shah of Iran, establishing the Pahlavi dynasty[1][3].

6. Reza Khan adopted the dynastic name "Pahlavi," which recalled the Middle Persian language of the Sasanian Empire, to strengthen his nationalist credentials[1].

This series of events transformed Iran from the Qajar monarchy to the Pahlavi dynasty, marking a significant shift in the country's political landscape and setting the stage for the modernization efforts that would characterize the Pahlavi era[2][3].
