The architect of the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art is Kamran Diba. He designed the museum in 1977[1][2]. Kamran Diba is a renowned Iranian architect, urban planner, and artist[1]. He is also the cousin of Farah Pahlavi, the former Empress of Iran, who played a significant role in establishing the museum[2][5].

Some key points about Kamran Diba and his design of the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art:

1. Diba drew inspiration from traditional Persian architecture, particularly the windcatchers (badgirs) of desert towns like Yazd and Kashan, while incorporating modernist principles[1][2].

2. The museum's design features a striking blend of brick, concrete, and glass, utilizing local materials in a contemporary form[1].

3. The building has a low profile and integrates well with its surroundings, reflecting the Persian concept of humility in architecture[1].

4. Most of the museum area is located underground, with a circular walkway that spirals downwards and galleries branching outwards[4][5].

5. The exterior design represents traditional Iranian wind catchers, while the interior layout is reminiscent of the modern Guggenheim Museum in New York[5].

6. Diba's design masterfully balances modernist architectural ideals with deep-rooted traditions of Persian culture, embodying Iran's contemporary aspirations and rich historical identity[1].

The Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, completed in 1977, stands as a significant example of modern architecture in Iran, showcasing Kamran Diba's ability to seamlessly blend Persian architectural traditions with minimalist principles of modernism[1].
