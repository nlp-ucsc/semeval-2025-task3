At its peak around 480 BCE, the Achaemenid Empire (also known as the Persian Empire) governed approximately 44% of the world's population[1][3]. This remarkable feat made it the largest empire in history by percentage of global population ruled.

Some key details about the Achaemenid Empire's population and extent:

- The empire contained an estimated 49.4 million people out of a total world population of about 112.4 million at that time[3][4].

- It covered a vast territory of over 5.5 million square kilometers (2.1 million square miles), spanning from the Balkans and Egypt in the west to the Indus Valley in the east[7].

- The empire included parts of Central Asia, the Mediterranean, North Africa, and even European territories such as ancient Thrace and Macedonia[3].

- It was founded by Cyrus the Great in 550 BCE and reached its territorial peak under Darius I and Xerxes I in the early 5th century BCE[2].

- Some estimates put the empire's population as high as 50 million[2][5][6].

It's important to note that population estimates for ancient empires can vary and have some degree of uncertainty. However, multiple sources consistently cite the 44% figure, making it a widely accepted estimate[1][3][4]. This percentage is considered the highest share of global population ever ruled by a single empire in recorded history.

The Achaemenid Empire's ability to govern such a large proportion of the world's population was due to several factors, including its efficient centralized bureaucracy, multicultural policies, advanced infrastructure, and strong military[7]. These innovations allowed the Persians to effectively administer their vast territories and diverse subject peoples.
