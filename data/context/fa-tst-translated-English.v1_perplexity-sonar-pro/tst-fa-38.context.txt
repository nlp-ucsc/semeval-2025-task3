Several Persian translations and adaptations of "Kalila and Dimna" were made over the centuries:

1. Abū al-Fażl Bal'amī (d. 940) produced an early prose translation from Arabic into Persian, commissioned by the Samanid ruler Naṣr II b. Aḥmad. However, this version has not survived[1].

2. The poet Rūdakī (d. ca. 940) created a verse adaptation of Bal'amī's work, of which only fragments remain[1].

3. The most influential Persian version was produced by Abū al-Ma'ālī Naṣr Allāh Munshī in the mid-1140s. He translated it from the Arabic version of Ibn al-Muqaffa', adding extensive quotes from the Qur'an, hadith, and Persian and Arabic poetry. This version is considered one of the foundational works of Persian "artistic prose"[1][5].

4. Around the same time (1149 CE), Muḥammad ibn 'Abd Allāh al-Bukhārī created a simpler Persian rendering, though this version was less influential[1].

5. In 1260, Bahāʾ-al-Din Aḥmad b. Moḥammad Qāneʿi Ṭusi turned Naṣr Allāh's version into a mathnawi (a form of Persian poetry)[5].

6. In the late 15th century, Ḥosayn Wāʿeẓ Kašefi (d. 1504-5) created a new Persian version called "Anwār-e Sohayli," which became very popular[5][6].

7. About a century later, Abu'l-Fażl ʿAllāmi (d. 1602) revised Kašefi's version for the Mughal emperor Akbar, calling it "ʿEyār-e dāneš"[5].

Among these, Naṣr Allāh Munshī's 12th-century translation is often considered the most significant and influential in Persian literature[1][5][10].
