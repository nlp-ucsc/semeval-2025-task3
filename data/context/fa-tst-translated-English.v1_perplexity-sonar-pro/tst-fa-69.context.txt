The largest protected area in Iran is the Naybandan Wildlife Refuge in Tabas. Turan Protected Area, also known as Khar Turan National Park, is the second-largest protected area in Iran[1].

Turan Protected Area encompasses a vast wilderness that borders the central desert of Iran. Some key facts about Turan Protected Area:

- It spans 1,470,640 hectares (14,706 square kilometers)[1].
- It was designated as a wildlife refuge in 1972 and gained UNESCO Biosphere Reserve status in 1976[1].
- The central part was upgraded to national park status in 2002[1].
- It is the second-largest biosphere reserve in the world, after only the Serengeti in Tanzania[1].

Within Turan's borders lies a mosaic of protected zones, including:

- Turan National Park 
- Turan Wildlife Refuge

Together, these areas cover over 1 million hectares[1]. The park features diverse landscapes ranging from arid desert zones to lush oases, surrounded by prominent mountains like Shotorkuh, Qale Bala, and Kuh-e Peyghambar[1].

While Turan is the second-largest, Iran has been expanding its network of protected areas in recent years. As of 2024, protected areas under the supervision of the Department of Environment account for 11.8% of Iran's total land area, covering 19.5 million hectares across more than 300 sites[3]. This represents a significant increase from the 58 protected areas covering 6.335 million hectares before the 1979 Islamic Revolution[3].
