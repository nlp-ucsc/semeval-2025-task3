The first National Consultative Assembly of Iran was inaugurated on October 7, 1906[1]. This legislative assembly, also known as the First Iranian Majlis, marked a significant milestone in Iran's constitutional history. It was formally opened by Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar and operated from October 7, 1906, to June 23, 1908[1].

This inaugural parliament was established as a result of the Persian Constitutional Revolution and the promulgation of the Persian Constitution of 1906. The constitution, which was ratified by Mozaffar ad-Din Shah on December 30, 1906, laid the foundation for this new legislative body[2].

Some key points about the first National Consultative Assembly:

1. It consisted of 160 members[1].
2. The first Chairman (Speaker) was Morteza Gholi Khan Hedayat[1].
3. The assembly represented the whole of the people of Persia, allowing them to participate in the economic and political affairs of the country[2].
4. Members were elected for two-year terms[2].
5. The assembly had the right to propose measures for the well-being of the government and the people, subject to approval by the Senate and the Shah[2].

The establishment of this assembly was a crucial step towards constitutional monarchy in Iran, limiting the absolute power of the Shah and introducing elements of representative governance.
