The first science and technology park in Iran was established in Tehran. Specifically, it was the University of Tehran Science and Technology Park (UTSTP), which was launched in 2001[1].

To provide more details:

1. The University of Tehran Science and Technology Park (UTSTP) is Iran's first and oldest university park[1].

2. It was established in Tehran, the capital city of Iran, in 2001[1].

3. UTSTP serves as a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship, supporting various stakeholders including scientists, researchers, academics, students, and knowledge-based businesses[1].

4. The park's mission is to support the commercialization of innovation from the University of Tehran's ecosystem and to increase local competitiveness[1].

5. Currently, UTSTP is home to 300 companies employing over 6,500 people, focusing on sectors such as biotech, energy, agriculture, and ICT[1].

It's worth noting that while UTSTP was the first, several other science and technology parks have since been established across Iran. For example:

- Isfahan Science and Technology Town (ISTT) in Isfahan[3]
- Pardis Technology Park, located 20 km northeast of Tehran[4][7]
- Kermanshah Science and Technology Park[5]
- Sharif Science and Technology Park in Tehran, established in 2016[8]

As of recent reports, there are now over 40 science and technology parks operating in Iran[6], showcasing the country's commitment to fostering innovation and technological development.
