The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal, was signed on July 14, 2015[1][2]. This landmark agreement was reached between Iran and the P5+1 (the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council—China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States—plus Germany) together with the European Union[1]. The deal was finalized in Vienna, Austria, after extensive negotiations[1].

The JCPOA was the culmination of a 20-month negotiation process that began with the adoption of the Joint Plan of Action in November 2013[1]. The agreement aimed to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief and other provisions[1][2]. Following its signing, the United Nations Security Council formally endorsed the agreement on July 20, 2015, through Resolution 2231[1][3].

It's important to note that while the agreement was reached in 2015, its implementation began on January 16, 2016, when the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) certified that Iran had taken the key steps to restrict its nuclear program and had put in place increased monitoring[3][9].
