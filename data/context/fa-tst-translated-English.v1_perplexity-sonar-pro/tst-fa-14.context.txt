The Alborz mountain range passes through several provinces in northern Iran. Based on the information provided in the search results, we can identify the following provinces:

1. Alborz Province: This province, with its capital city Karaj, is located at the foothills of the Alborz mountains[3]. While it's Iran's smallest province by area, it's directly associated with the mountain range, even sharing its name.

2. Tehran Province: Although not explicitly mentioned in the search results, Tehran, Iran's capital city, is known to be located near the southern foothills of the Alborz mountains. The search results mention that Karaj lies 10 km west of Tehran[3], indicating Tehran's proximity to the range.

3. Mazandaran Province: This province is indirectly referenced in the search results. The city of Sari, which is mentioned as a reference point for describing the eastern part of the Alborz[7], is the capital of Mazandaran Province.

4. Gilan Province: The search results mention that the Gilan region receives significant precipitation (1,000 mm or 40 inches annually)[4], indicating that the Alborz range passes through this province.

5. Golestan Province: While not directly named, the city of Gorgan is mentioned in the context of describing the eastern section of the Alborz range[1], and Gorgan is the capital of Golestan Province.

6. Semnan Province: The city of Semnan is mentioned as a reference point for describing the eastern part of the Alborz[7], indicating that the mountain range likely passes through or near this province.

7. North Khorasan Province: The search results mention that the Alborz range extends to the "northern parts of the Khorasan region"[1], which likely refers to North Khorasan Province.

It's important to note that the Alborz mountain range spans approximately 900 km (560 miles) in length[1][4], forming a crescent shape along the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. Therefore, it's likely that the range also passes through or influences other nearby provinces not explicitly mentioned in the search results.
