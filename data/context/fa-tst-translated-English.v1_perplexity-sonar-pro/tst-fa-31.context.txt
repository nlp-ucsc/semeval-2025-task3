The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, was signed in 2015 by the following participants:

1. Iran
2. The United States (withdrew in 2018)
3. United Kingdom
4. France 
5. Germany
6. Russia
7. China
8. European Union (as a coordinating entity)

These participants are often referred to as the P5+1 (the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany) along with Iran and the EU[1][2]. The agreement was the result of extensive negotiations between these parties, with the goal of limiting Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.

The European Union, represented by its High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, played a crucial role in coordinating the negotiations and continues to coordinate the Joint Commission established under the JCPOA[8].

It's worth noting that while the United States was an original signatory to the agreement, President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the JCPOA in May 2018[4]. Since then, there have been efforts to revive the deal, but as of 2023, the agreement's future remains uncertain.

The JCPOA was a landmark accord in international diplomacy and non-proliferation efforts. It was unique in several ways, including being the first time the UN Security Council had recognized a developing country's nuclear enrichment program within the framework of a resolution (UNSC Resolution 2231)[2].
