In 2013, Sorena Sattari was selected as the head of Iran's National Elites Foundation (INEF).

Sorena Sattari served as the vice president for science and technology under Presidents Hassan Rouhani and Ebrahim Raisi from 2013 to 2022[5]. As part of this role, he oversaw the National Elites Foundation.

According to a 2014 interview with Fars News Agency, Sattari stated that among Iran's population of over 77 million at the time, only 13,000 people were members of INEF. Of those, only 72 were considered "elite" while the rest were categorized as "highly talented" or "brilliant talent" individuals with intellectual giftedness and potential to become elites with proper support and guidance[1].

The National Elites Foundation aims to identify, organize and support Iran's top talents, particularly in science, research, technology and the arts. It provides various forms of support to its members, including financial assistance, access to resources and facilities, involvement in national projects, and help commercializing innovations[1].
