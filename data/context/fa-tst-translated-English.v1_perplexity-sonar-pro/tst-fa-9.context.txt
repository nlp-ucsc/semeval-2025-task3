Mount Damavand is the highest peak in Iran. It stands at a height of approximately 5,610 meters (18,406 feet) above sea level[1][7][9].

Mount Damavand is not only the tallest mountain in Iran but also holds several other notable distinctions:

1. It is the highest volcano in Asia[1][6].
2. It ranks as the 12th most prominent peak globally[9].
3. It is the second most prominent peak in Asia, after Mount Everest[5].

Located in the Alborz mountain range, about 80 km northeast of Tehran, Damavand is a dormant stratovolcano[5][6]. Its impressive height and conical shape make it visible from great distances, and it has become an iconic symbol deeply rooted in Persian culture, literature, and mythology[1][6].

It's worth noting that there are slight variations in the reported height of Damavand across different sources. While most recent and official sources cite 5,610 meters, some measurements have reported heights ranging from 5,609 to 5,671 meters[1][2][5]. These minor discrepancies likely result from different measurement techniques and the ongoing scientific interest in accurately determining the mountain's precise elevation.
