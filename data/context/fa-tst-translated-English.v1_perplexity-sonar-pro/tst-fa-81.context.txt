The translation movement reached its peak during the reigns of two Abbasid caliphs:

1. Harun al-Rashid (r. 786-809 CE)
2. Al-Ma'mun (r. 813-833 CE)

Harun al-Rashid initiated significant support for the translation movement, but it was under his son Al-Ma'mun that the movement truly flourished and reached its zenith[1][2][3].

Al-Ma'mun, in particular, is credited with greatly expanding and institutionalizing the translation efforts:

1. He established the famous Bayt al-Hikma (House of Wisdom) in Baghdad, which became a major center for translation and scholarly activities[3].

2. Al-Ma'mun actively encouraged and funded the translation of Greek, Persian, and Indian texts into Arabic[3].

3. He sent scholars across the known world to collect and bring back scientific and literary works for translation[1].

4. Under his patronage, the translation movement expanded to cover a wide range of subjects including philosophy, science, medicine, and mathematics[2][3].

5. Al-Ma'mun employed a large cadre of translators, tutors, physicians, and advisors to carry out this massive undertaking[5].

The efforts initiated by Harun al-Rashid and greatly expanded by Al-Ma'mun led to a period of intense intellectual activity and cross-cultural exchange, making Baghdad a center of learning and contributing significantly to what is known as the Islamic Golden Age[3][4].

It's worth noting that while these two caliphs' reigns marked the peak of the movement, the translation efforts continued for nearly three centuries during the Abbasid period, involving many other caliphs and patrons[2]. This sustained effort had a profound impact on the preservation and advancement of knowledge in the Islamic world and beyond.
