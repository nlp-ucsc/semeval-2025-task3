The first food product produced through biotechnology was introduced to the market in 1994. This was the Flavr Savr tomato, developed by Calgene[1][7][9].

The Flavr Savr tomato was genetically engineered to have a longer shelf life compared to conventional tomatoes. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for sale in grocery stores in 1994[9]. This marked a significant milestone in the commercial application of genetic engineering to food crops.

However, it's worth noting that while the Flavr Savr was the first genetically modified whole food product to reach the market, it was not a commercial success. The tomato faced issues with high production and distribution costs, which ultimately led to its failure in the marketplace[7].

Prior to the Flavr Savr tomato, other biotechnology products had been approved for use in food production, but these were not whole foods themselves:

1. In 1988, genetically modified microbial enzymes were first approved for use in food manufacture[1].
2. In the early 1990s, recombinant chymosin (a genetically engineered enzyme used in cheese production) was approved for use in several countries[1].

After the introduction of the Flavr Savr tomato, the adoption of genetically engineered crops increased rapidly. By the late 1990s, genetically modified varieties of crops such as soybeans, corn, cotton, and canola became widely cultivated[3][9].
