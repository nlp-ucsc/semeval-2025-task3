Lake Urmia has experienced significant shrinkage over the past few decades, but it's important to note that the lake's size has fluctuated considerably. To answer your specific question about the lake's area in the year 1400 (which I assume refers to the Persian calendar year 1400, equivalent to 2021-2022 in the Gregorian calendar):

By 2021-2022, Lake Urmia had retained only a small fraction of its original area. According to the search results:

1. In 2017, the lake had shrunk to only 10% of its original size from 1972[10].

2. By 2022, 95% of the lake had dried up[10].

3. At its greatest extent, Lake Urmia covered a surface area of approximately 5,000-6,000 square kilometers (1,930-2,317 square miles)[1][3].

4. In recent years, the lake's surface area has fluctuated significantly. For instance, in April 2019, it reached about 3,000 square kilometers (1,200 square miles) after heavy rains[5].

5. However, by autumn 2023, the lake had nearly dried out again, transforming into a vast, dry salt flat[2].

Given this information, we can conclude that in the year 1400 (2021-2022), Lake Urmia likely retained only about 5-10% of its original area. This means the lake's surface area was probably between 250-600 square kilometers (97-232 square miles) during this period, though exact figures may vary due to seasonal fluctuations and ongoing environmental changes.

It's worth noting that the lake's size has been highly variable in recent years due to factors such as climate change, drought, water mismanagement, and conservation efforts[3]. The situation remains dynamic, with periods of partial recovery followed by renewed shrinkage.
