Iran has an area of 1,648,195 square kilometers (636,372 square miles)[1][4][6]. In terms of world ranking by size, Iran holds the 17th position globally[1][6][10].

To provide more context:

1. Iran is the sixth-largest country entirely in Asia and the second-largest in West Asia[1].

2. It occupies a significant portion of the Iranian Plateau and is one of the world's most mountainous countries[1].

3. Iran's geography is diverse, featuring:
   - Rugged mountain ranges like the Caucasus, Zagros, and Alborz[1]
   - Desert basins such as the Kavir Desert and Lut Desert[1]
   - Lush lowland Caspian Hyrcanian forests along the Caspian Sea[1]
   - Coastal plains along the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman[1]

4. The country's highest point is Mount Damavand, standing at 5,610 meters (18,406 feet), which is also the highest volcano in Asia[1][4].

5. Iran's size and diverse geography have significantly influenced its politics, economics, and culture throughout history[1].

It's worth noting that while most sources consistently report Iran's area as 1,648,195 square kilometers, there is a slight discrepancy in one source. The World Bank reported Iran's land area (excluding inland water bodies) as 1,622,500 square kilometers in 2022[7]. This minor difference likely accounts for the exclusion of water bodies in the World Bank's calculation.
