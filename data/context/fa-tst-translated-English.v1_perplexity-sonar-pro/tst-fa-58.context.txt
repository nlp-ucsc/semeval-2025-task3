The Iranian Basketball Super League (IBSL), which is the top professional basketball league in Iran, was founded in 1998[3]. This league has since evolved into a highly competitive platform that attracts both local and international players, coaches, and fans[3].

The IBSL follows a promotion and relegation system, where the two worst-performing teams are relegated to the 1st Division at the end of each season[3]. This system helps maintain competitiveness and provides opportunities for lower-division teams to rise to the top league.

Some key points about the Iranian Basketball Super League:

1. Structure: It is a professional men's basketball league[3].
2. Founding year: 1998[3].
3. Current format: The league includes multiple teams competing throughout a season, with games typically starting in October[1].
4. International recognition: The league has gained prominence in the Middle East and is known for offering competitive salaries to players[4].

It's worth noting that while the IBSL is the current top-tier league, basketball has a longer history in Iran. However, the establishment of the IBSL in 1998 marked the beginning of a more structured and professional era for basketball in the country.
