Hungary was the first country to recognize Ukraine's independence, establishing diplomatic relations on December 3, 1991, just two days after Ukraine's independence referendum[7]. This was quickly followed by several other countries in rapid succession:

1. Lithuania on December 12, 1991
2. Bulgaria on December 13, 1991
3. Armenia on December 25, 1991
4. Israel on December 26, 1991
5. Belarus and Moldova on December 27, 1991[7]

The United States recognized Ukraine's independence on December 25, 1991, when President George H.W. Bush announced the decision in an address to the nation regarding the dissolution of the Soviet Union[6]. However, diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Ukraine were formally established on January 3, 1992[7].

Other major countries that recognized Ukraine's independence early in 1992 include:

- China on January 4, 1992
- Poland on January 4, 1992
- United Kingdom on January 10, 1992
- Germany on January 17, 1992[7]

It's worth noting that while these countries were among the first to officially recognize Ukraine's independence, the process of Ukraine becoming an independent state had been ongoing for some time. The Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine was issued on July 16, 1990, and the Act of Declaration of Independence was ratified on August 24, 1991[7]. The independence referendum on December 1, 1991, where about 90% of voters supported independence, was a crucial step that paved the way for widespread international recognition[3].
