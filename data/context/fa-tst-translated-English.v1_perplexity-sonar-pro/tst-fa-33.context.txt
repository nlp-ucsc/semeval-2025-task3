Ali-Asghar Khan Atabak was the first official prime minister of Iran[1]. He served in this role from May 4, 1907 to August 31, 1907, a tenure of 119 days. 

Some key points about the establishment of the prime minister position in Iran:

- The office of Prime Minister of Iran was established in 1907 during the Persian Constitutional Revolution[1].

- Before the Constitutional Revolution, the head of government in Iran was called the Grand Vizier (Sadr-e A'zam or Vazir-e A'zam)[1].

- There was a brief period with an acting prime minister before Ali-Asghar Khan Atabak took office. Soltan-Ali Vazir-e Afkham served as Acting Prime Minister from March 21, 1907 to April 29, 1907[1].

- Ali-Asghar Khan Atabak's term as the first official prime minister was relatively short, lasting only 119 days. He was assassinated on August 31, 1907, ending his time in office[1].

- The prime minister position continued to exist in Iran until 1989, when it was abolished following a constitutional referendum[1].

It's worth noting that the establishment of this position marked a significant change in Iran's governmental structure, moving towards a more modern system of governance with separate executive leadership. The role of prime minister would go on to be a crucial position in Iranian politics for over 80 years until its abolition in 1989.
