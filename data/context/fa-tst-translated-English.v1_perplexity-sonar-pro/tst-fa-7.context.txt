Ahmad Shah Qajar was the last ruling member of the Qajar dynasty and the final Qajar king of Iran. He lost the throne in 1925[4][5][7].

Ahmad Shah Qajar ascended to the throne at the young age of 12 on July 16, 1909, after his father Mohammad Ali Shah was deposed[4]. He was formally crowned on July 21, 1914, upon reaching the age of majority[10].

During his reign, Ahmad Shah faced numerous challenges, including:

1. Political instability and foreign interventions
2. The occupation of Iran by Russian and British troops during World War I
3. Growing influence of military leader Reza Khan

In November 1923, Ahmad Shah left Iran for Europe, ostensibly for medical treatment[4]. However, he never returned to Iran. While abroad, he attempted to organize an armed rebellion against Reza Khan with the help of his ally, Sheikh Khazal of Khuzestan, but this effort was unsuccessful[4].

The end of Ahmad Shah's reign came in multiple stages:

1. In October 1925, the Iranian parliament formally deposed Ahmad Shah while he was absent in Europe[7].
2. In December 1925, the National Consultative Assembly officially declared the removal of Ahmad Shah Qajar and approved the establishment of a new state under Reza Khan's leadership[5].
3. The following year, in 1926, Reza Khan declared himself the new Shah of Iran, founding the Pahlavi dynasty[5].

This marked the end of the Qajar dynasty, which had ruled Iran for 136 years since 1789[1]. Ahmad Shah Qajar died in exile in France on February 21, 1930, at the age of 32[10].
