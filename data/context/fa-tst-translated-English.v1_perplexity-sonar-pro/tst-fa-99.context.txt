Saadi, the renowned Persian poet, is believed to have passed away between 1291 and 1294 CE[1][2][4][7][8][9][10]. While there is some discrepancy regarding the exact date of his death, most sources agree on this range.

Some specific details about Saadi's death include:

1. He died in his hometown of Shiraz, Iran[1][2][4].

2. Some sources provide more precise dates:
   - December 9, 1291, according to Britannica[7].
   - Around 1292, as mentioned by Mehr News Agency[4].

3. At the time of his death, Saadi was likely in his 80s or early 90s. He was born around 1200-1210 CE, which means he lived a long life for his era[3][4][10].

4. His tomb, known as Saadieh or Sa'di Tomb, is located in southern Shiraz and has become a major tourist attraction[4][5]. The current mausoleum was constructed in the 1950s, replacing earlier structures[4].

5. Annually, on April 20 or 21 (depending on leap years), Iran commemorates Saadi Day, gathering scholars and literature enthusiasts at his tomb to honor his legacy[3][10].

While the exact date may be uncertain, it's clear that Saadi's influence on Persian literature and culture has endured for centuries after his death in the late 13th century.
