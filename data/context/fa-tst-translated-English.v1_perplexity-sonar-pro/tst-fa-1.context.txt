Shah Ismail I, the founder of the Safavid Empire, was the first Safavid ruler to declare Shia Islam as the official religion of Iran[1][2]. 

In 1501, after conquering Tabriz and establishing the Safavid dynasty, Ismail I proclaimed himself Shah (King) of Iran and officially declared Twelver Shia Islam as the state religion[3][6]. This marked a significant turning point in Islamic and Iranian history, as it was the first time Shia Islam became the official religion of a major Islamic state since the Fatimid Caliphate[1].

Ismail I took several steps to enforce and spread Shia Islam throughout his newly formed empire:

1. He ordered all mosques in his domain to use the Shia version of the Islamic call to prayer[1].
2. He mandated the public cursing of the first three Sunni caliphs (Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman)[1].
3. He brought Shia scholars from Lebanon and Syria to Iran to help spread Shia beliefs[2].
4. He used state funds to construct schools for teaching Shia doctrine and build shrines dedicated to Ali and his family[2].
5. He formed a group called "Tabarra'iyyun" who publicly cursed Sunni caliphs in the streets[4].

Ismail I's decision to make Shia Islam the official religion was not just a religious move but also a political one. It helped to differentiate the Safavid Empire from its Sunni neighbors, particularly the Ottoman Empire, and created a distinct Persian identity[6][9]. This policy of forced conversion was often met with resistance, and Ismail I used coercion and force to implement it, giving Sunni clerics and theologians the choice of conversion, exile, or death[2][4].

The establishment of Shia Islam as the state religion had long-lasting effects on Iran. It transformed the country from a predominantly Sunni nation to a Shia majority within a century, a demographic shift that persists to this day[2][5].
