The Islamic Golden Age began in the 8th century AD and ended in the 13th century AD[1][2]. However, there are some variations in the exact timeline:

1. Traditional timeline:
   The Islamic Golden Age is traditionally said to have lasted from the 8th century AD to the 13th century AD[1][2]. This period is most commonly associated with the flourishing of science, culture, and economic development under various caliphates.

2. Starting point:
   The beginning of the Islamic Golden Age is often linked to the reign of the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid (786-809 AD)[2]. This period saw the inauguration of the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, which became a major center for the translation and preservation of classical knowledge.

3. Ending point:
   The end of the Islamic Golden Age is frequently associated with the Mongol invasion and the Siege of Baghdad in 1258 AD[2]. This event led to the destruction of the House of Wisdom and marked a significant decline in the cultural and scientific output of the Islamic world.

4. Alternative timelines:
   - Some scholars extend the end date to around 1350 AD, including the Timurid Renaissance[2].
   - Others place the end as late as the 15th-16th centuries, encompassing the rise of Islamic gunpowder empires like the Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal Empires[1][2].
   - Some researchers, like Khan (2003), identify a more focused golden age between 750 and 950 AD[2].

It's important to note that the concept of the Islamic Golden Age and its exact timeline can vary depending on the criteria used by different historians and the specific aspects of Islamic civilization being considered.
