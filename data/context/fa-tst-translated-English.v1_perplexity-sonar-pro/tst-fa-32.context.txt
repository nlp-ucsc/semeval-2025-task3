The August 19 coup occurred in 1991 and ultimately failed after three days. 

The coup attempt began on August 19, 1991 when a group of hardline Soviet officials, known as the "Gang of Eight" or the State Committee on the State of Emergency, attempted to seize power from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev[1][3]. The coup plotters placed Gorbachev under house arrest at his dacha in Crimea and announced that he was unable to perform his duties due to "ill health"[1].

Key events during the coup attempt:

- Tanks and troops were deployed in Moscow[1][2]
- Boris Yeltsin, the president of the Russian Republic, rallied opposition to the coup by climbing atop a tank outside the Russian parliament building (known as the White House) and calling for resistance[1][3]
- Thousands of citizens gathered around the White House to defend it against a potential military assault[1][2]
- Some military units defected to support Yeltsin and the opposition[1]

The coup collapsed after just three days on August 21, 1991 due to several factors:

- Widespread popular resistance in Moscow and other cities[1][2]
- The refusal of many military and KGB units to obey orders to attack the opposition[1][3]
- The coup plotters' lack of a clear plan and their hesitation to use force[3]
- Yeltsin's effective leadership in rallying opposition[1][3]

Aftermath of the failed coup:

- Gorbachev was freed and returned to Moscow, but his authority was severely weakened[1][5]
- The Communist Party was banned in Russia and its property confiscated[4]
- Boris Yeltsin's popularity and power increased dramatically[5]
- The coup attempt accelerated the dissolution of the Soviet Union, with many republics declaring independence in the following months[3][5]
- By December 1991, the Soviet Union had officially ceased to exist[3]

In summary, the August 1991 coup was a pivotal moment that hastened the collapse of the Soviet Union and marked the ascendancy of Boris Yeltsin and the Russian Federation over the central Soviet government[1][3][5].
