The first national car of Iran was called the Paykan (also spelled PeykƒÅn), which means "Arrow" in Persian. It was produced by Iran Khodro (formerly known as Iran National) starting in 1967[1][3].

The Paykan was a licensed version of the British Rootes Arrow, specifically based on the Hillman Hunter model[3]. It was introduced to Iran by Mahmoud Khayami, co-founder and owner of Iran Khodro, who recognized the need for an affordable, simple car for the Iranian market[3].

Key points about the Paykan:

1. Production began in May 1967, initially at a rate of 6,000 units per year[4].

2. It quickly became popular and was known as the "national car of Iran"[1][2].

3. The Paykan was produced for nearly four decades, from 1967 to 2005[3].

4. Initially, the cars were assembled from complete knock-down (CKD) kits imported from the UK[3].

5. By the mid-1970s, full-scale manufacturing of the car (except for the engine) had started in Iran[1].

6. Production reached about 100,000 units annually by 1977[1].

7. The Paykan went through various iterations, including standard, deluxe, sport, and taxi versions[1].

8. It played a significant role in Iran's industrialization and automotive sector development[2].

The Paykan became an icon in Iranian culture, symbolizing different things in different eras - from modernization and consumerism in the pre-revolution period to resilience and practicality in the post-revolution years[2]. Its long production run and widespread use made it a crucial part of Iran's automotive history and national identity.
