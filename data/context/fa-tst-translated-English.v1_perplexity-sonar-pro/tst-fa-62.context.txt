According to the most recent data available, the literacy rate in Iran in 2022 was 88.96%, which represents a 3.42% increase from 2016[4]. While there isn't a specific figure provided for 2021, we can infer that the literacy rate was likely between 85.54% (the 2016 rate) and 88.96% (the 2022 rate).

Some key points about literacy in Iran:

1. The overall literacy rate has been steadily increasing over the years. From 1976 to 2022, it rose from 36.52% to 88.96%[4].

2. There is a gender gap in literacy rates. As of 2022, the literacy rate among men was 90.4%, while among women it was 87.1%[1].

3. Urban areas have higher literacy rates compared to rural areas, especially for women. The literacy rate for women in urban areas is estimated at 90%, while in rural areas it stands at 77.8%[1].

4. Youth literacy rates are significantly higher than the overall literacy rate. The youth literacy rate (ages 15-24) was reported to be 96.3%, with 96.5% for males and 96% for females[3].

5. Despite improvements, Iran still faces challenges in education. In the 2022-2023 academic year, over 556,000 children between the ages of 15 and 17 dropped out of high school, primarily due to economic factors[2].

6. The Iranian government has set goals to improve literacy rates further. The literacy growth rate in Iran is reported to be 2.5 times the world average, indicating significant efforts to enhance education in the country.

While Iran has made substantial progress in improving literacy rates over the past few decades, there are still areas for improvement, particularly in rural areas and among certain age groups.
