Hafez, the renowned 14th century Persian poet, is known as the "Tongue of the Unseen" (Lisan al-Ghayb in Persian)[1][2]. This title reflects Hafez's reputation for profound insight and his ability to speak of hidden truths and mysteries in his poetry.

Hafez, whose full name was Khwaja Shams al-Din Mohammad Hafez-e Shirazi, was born in Shiraz, Iran around 1315 CE and passed away in 1390 CE[2]. He is considered one of the most influential and beloved poets in Persian literature, known primarily for his ghazals - lyric poems that often deal with themes of love, spirituality, and social critique.

The epithet "Tongue of the Unseen" is significant for several reasons:

1. Mystical insight: It suggests that Hafez had access to hidden knowledge or spiritual truths, speaking of matters beyond ordinary perception[2].

2. Prophetic quality: Many Iranians believe Hafez's poems have a prophetic or oracular quality, often using his Divan (collected works) for bibliomancy - seeking guidance by randomly opening the book and interpreting the chosen poem[1].

3. Poetic genius: The title acknowledges Hafez's unparalleled skill in crafting verses that seem to reveal profound truths about human nature and the divine[1].

4. Cultural significance: Hafez's Divan is found in many Iranian homes and is used for divination, especially during important occasions or when seeking guidance[2][4].

Hafez's poetry combines elements of love, mysticism, and social commentary, often using symbolism and metaphor to convey complex ideas. His work has had a lasting impact on Persian culture and has been widely translated and admired internationally, influencing figures such as Goethe[2].

The enduring popularity of Hafez in Iran and his reputation as the "Tongue of the Unseen" speak to the deep cultural resonance of his poetry and the belief in its ability to offer wisdom and insight across centuries.
