Hossein Behzad (1894-1968) is known as the founder of the Tehran miniature school[1]. He played a significant role in revitalizing and modernizing Persian miniature painting in the 20th century.

Behzad's contributions to the Tehran miniature school include:

1. Innovative style: During a 13-month stay in Paris in 1934, Behzad developed a completely new style of miniature painting that combined aspects of traditional Persian painting with contemporary Western techniques[1]. This fusion became the foundation of the Tehran miniature school.

2. Educational impact: In the early 1930s, Behzad reorganized Tehran's Sanaye Mostazrafeh Art School, which helped establish the framework for teaching this new style of miniature painting[1].

3. International recognition: Behzad's work gained international acclaim, winning awards such as the 'first class medal of the ministry of culture' from Iran in 1949 and the 'first class medal of international painting' from Minneapolis, USA in 1958[1]. This recognition helped establish the Tehran school's reputation globally.

4. Exhibitions and influence: Behzad held numerous exhibitions worldwide, including a significant show at the Iran Bastan Museum in 1953 and another at the Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de Paris in 1955[1]. These exhibitions spread awareness and appreciation for the new Tehran style of miniature painting.

5. Legacy: The Behzad Museum, founded in 1994 in Tehran's Sa'dabad Complex, houses a large collection of his works, ensuring the continued study and appreciation of the Tehran miniature school[1].

Behzad's approach to miniature painting, which merged traditional Persian techniques with modern influences, set the foundation for the Tehran school and inspired subsequent generations of Iranian artists to explore new possibilities within this ancient art form.
