According to recent data, 77.26% of Iran's population lives in urban areas as of 2023[2][8]. This high level of urbanization reflects a significant concentration of people in cities and towns across the country.

Some key points about Iran's urban population:

1. Trend: The urban population in Iran has been steadily increasing over the years. From 2022 to 2023, there was a 1.29% increase in the urban population[1].

2. Growth rate: The annual urban population growth rate is estimated at 1.79%[3], indicating continued urbanization.

3. Total urban population: As of 2023, Iran's urban population was approximately 68,892,205 people[1].

4. Major urban centers: Tehran, the capital, is the largest city with a population of over 7 million. Other major urban areas include Mashhad, Isfahan, Karaj, and Tabriz[7].

5. Future projections: The rate of urbanization is expected to continue, with an estimated 1.32% annual rate of change from 2020 to 2025[9].

This high level of urbanization has significant implications for Iran's infrastructure, economy, and social dynamics. It presents both challenges and opportunities for urban planning, service provision, and sustainable development in the country's cities and towns.
