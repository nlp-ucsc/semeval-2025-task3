The establishment of the first university in Iran depends on how we define a "university" and whether we consider ancient institutions or modern ones. Here's a detailed breakdown:

## Ancient Institutions

The oldest institution of higher learning in Iran, and potentially one of the oldest in the world, was the Academy of Gondishapur (also known as Jundishapur), established in the 3rd century AD during the Sasanian Empire[9]. This academy was renowned for its medical education and was considered one of the most important intellectual centers of its time[9].

## Modern Universities

If we focus on modern universities as we know them today:

1. The first prototype of a modern national institution was the Dar al-Funun College, established in 1851[1]. This college, founded by Mirza Taghi Khan Amir Kabir, aimed to train Iranian experts in various fields of science and technology[1].

2. The University of Tehran, often considered Iran's first modern university, was officially established in 1934[1][2][4]. It was designed by French architect Andre Godard and is currently Iran's largest university with over 32,000 students[1].

3. The initial proposal for the University of Tehran was made by Ismail Sang in 1927, with the first official steps taken on March 31, 1931[2][6].

## Other Notable Dates

- In 1855, "The Ministry of Science" was first established in Iran[1].
- In 1878, Joseph Cochran founded what is often credited as Iran's "first contemporary medical college" in Urmia[1].
- By 1941, at the end of the first Pahlavi period, the University of Tehran was still the only modern university in the country[1].

In conclusion, while ancient institutions of higher learning existed in Iran as early as the 3rd century AD, the first modern university in the contemporary sense was the University of Tehran, officially established in 1934. However, the foundations for modern higher education in Iran were laid in the mid-19th century with institutions like Dar al-Funun College.
