Lake Urmia is located between two provinces in northwestern Iran: West Azerbaijan and East Azerbaijan[1][2][3]. It does not lie entirely within a single province, but rather straddles the border between these two adjacent provinces.

The lake's position is significant in the region:

1. To the east of Lake Urmia lies Tabriz, which is the largest city in East Azerbaijan province[1].

2. To the west of the lake is the city of Urmia (also spelled Orumiyeh), which is the capital of West Azerbaijan province[1][4].

The lake's location at the intersection of these two provinces has made it an important geographical and ecological feature in northwestern Iran. It's worth noting that Lake Urmia is a salt lake and was once the largest lake in the Middle East[2][3]. Its unique position has made it a subject of interest for both provinces, particularly in recent years as the lake has faced significant environmental challenges, including dramatic shrinkage due to drought and water management issues[2][5].

The lake's basin covers a large area of about 20,000 square miles (52,000 square km), forming a significant drainage system in the region[3]. This extensive basin area means that while the lake itself is split between the two Azerbaijan provinces, its ecological and hydrological influence extends across a broader area of northwestern Iran.
