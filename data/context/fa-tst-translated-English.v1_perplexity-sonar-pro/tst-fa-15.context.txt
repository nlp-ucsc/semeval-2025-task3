Khuzestan Province has the highest oil production in Iran. This southwestern province is home to many of Iran's largest and most productive oil fields. Here are some key details about oil production in Khuzestan:

1. Major oil fields: Khuzestan contains several supergiant and giant oil fields, including:

   - Ahvaz Field: The largest oil field in Iran with initial oil in place of 65.5 billion barrels and production of 945,000 barrels per day[1].
   - Marun Field: The second largest, with 46.7 billion barrels of initial oil in place and production of 520,000 barrels per day[1].
   - Gachsaran Field: Contains 52.9 billion barrels of initial oil in place and produces 560,000 barrels per day[1].

2. Historical significance: The first successful oil exploration well in Iran, Masjid Suleiman-1, was drilled in Khuzestan in 1908, marking the beginning of Iran's oil industry[1].

3. Onshore production: The majority of Iran's onshore oil production comes from fields in Khuzestan. The province accounts for about 80% of Iran's total oil output[1][3].

4. Infrastructure: Khuzestan has well-developed oil infrastructure, including pipelines, processing facilities, and export terminals, supporting its high production levels.

5. Recent developments: Iran has been investing in enhancing production from Khuzestan's fields. For example, a recent $11.5 billion contract was signed to develop the Azadegan field in Khuzestan, aiming to more than double its production to 550,000 barrels per day[3].

6. Future prospects: The Iranian National Oil Company (NIOC) continues to focus on Khuzestan for maintaining and increasing Iran's oil production. The province is expected to play a crucial role in Iran's plans to boost overall crude oil production in the coming years[10].

While other provinces like Ilam and Bushehr also contribute to Iran's oil production, Khuzestan remains the heart of Iran's oil industry and its most prolific oil-producing region.
