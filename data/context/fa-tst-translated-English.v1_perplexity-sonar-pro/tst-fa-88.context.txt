China has the most championship titles in the Asian Games, having dominated the medal table in recent decades[1][3]. 

China has been the top-performing country at the Asian Games since the 1982 edition in New Delhi. At the most recent Asian Games in 2022 (held in Hangzhou, China), China further cemented its dominance by achieving several unprecedented milestones[1][3]:

1. China won 201 gold medals, becoming the first country to surpass 100 gold medals in a single Asian Games edition.

2. China's total medal count reached 383, making it the first country to exceed 300 overall medals in one edition.

3. China's performance was far ahead of the next two top-performing countries, Japan and South Korea, who combined had fewer overall medals than China alone.

To put China's dominance in perspective, the all-time medal table for the Asian Games shows[1]:

1. China: 1,674 gold medals, 3,570 total medals
2. Japan: 1,084 gold medals, 3,242 total medals
3. South Korea: 787 gold medals, 2,425 total medals

While the exact number of times China has been the overall champion is not explicitly stated in the search results, it's clear that China has been the dominant force in the Asian Games for several decades, consistently finishing at the top of the medal table since 1982[1][3].
