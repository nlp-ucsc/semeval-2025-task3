Iran shares land borders with seven countries:

1. Iraq: Iran's western neighbor, sharing a 994-mile (1,599 km) border[1][3]. This is one of Iran's longest land borders.

2. Turkey: Located to the northwest of Iran, sharing a 332-mile (534 km) border[1][3]. The border between Iran and Turkey is among the oldest in the world, first demarcated in 1514[1].

3. Armenia: A small country to the northwest of Iran, sharing the shortest border of just 27 miles (43 km)[1].

4. Azerbaijan: Also situated to the northwest of Iran, with a 268-mile (431 km) shared border[1].

5. Turkmenistan: Iran's northern neighbor, sharing the longest border with Iran at 713 miles (1,148 km)[1].

6. Afghanistan: Located to the east of Iran, sharing a 572-mile (921 km) border[1].

7. Pakistan: Situated to the southeast of Iran, with a 596-mile (959 km) shared border[1][4].

In addition to these land borders, Iran is bounded by several bodies of water:

- To the north: The Caspian Sea[3][6][7]
- To the south: The Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman[3][6][7]

It's worth noting that Iran does not share land borders with some nearby countries that are sometimes mistakenly associated with it, such as:

- Syria
- Saudi Arabia
- Kuwait
- Bahrain

These countries are in the region but do not directly border Iran[5][7].
