The Constitutional Revolution in Iran succeeded in 1906, when Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar signed the country's first constitution[1][4]. This event marked a significant milestone in Iranian history, establishing a constitutional monarchy and a parliament (Majles) in the country.

The revolution formally began in August 1906, when the Shah signed a royal decree calling for the election of a Constituent Assembly[1]. This day is known as "Constitution Day" in contemporary Iran. The signing of the constitution was a result of widespread protests and demands for democratic reforms, triggered by economic upheaval and growing resentment towards Western influence in the country[1].

However, it's important to note that the process of implementing and solidifying constitutional rule in Iran was not immediate or straightforward:

1. The initial success in 1906 was followed by periods of struggle and setbacks.

2. In 1908, Muhammad Ali Shah Qajar, who succeeded Mozaffar ad-Din Shah, led a military coup against the Majles, temporarily halting the constitutional process[1].

3. Constitutionalist forces regained control in 1909, forcing Muhammad Ali Shah's abdication and re-establishing the constitution[4].

4. The revolution is generally considered to have ended in December 1911, when the Shah's ministers, backed by Russian troops, expelled the deputies of the Second Majlis from parliament[4].

While 1906 marks the initial success of the Constitutional Revolution with the signing of the constitution, the struggle for constitutional governance in Iran continued for several years afterward, with various challenges and developments shaping the country's political landscape in the early 20th century.
