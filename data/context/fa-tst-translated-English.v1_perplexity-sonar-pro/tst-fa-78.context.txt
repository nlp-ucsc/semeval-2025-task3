The Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute was established in 1925 under the supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture-Jahad in Iran[1][2]. The institute was founded in response to the global rinderpest epidemic that was causing high death rates in livestock at the time[1][6].

Some key details about the institute's establishment:

1. Location: It was founded in Karaj, Iran[5].

2. Founder: The institute was founded by Mustafa Qoli Bayat[5].

3. Original purpose: The primary goal was to counter epidemics in domestic animals, particularly rinderpest[1][5].

4. Early development: Shortly after its establishment, the institute began producing vaccines against rinderpest, taking a significant step in the country's biological industry[1].

5. Early leadership: In 1931, Louis Delpy, a French veterinarian, became the third director of the institute and played a crucial role in its development[8].

The Razi Institute has since grown to become one of the most reputable scientific research centers in Iran, with a history spanning almost a century. It has expanded its activities to include the production of a wide range of vaccines and antisera for both veterinary and human use[1][2].
