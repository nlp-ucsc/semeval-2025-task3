The Solar Hijri calendar was officially declared the national calendar of Iran on March 31, 1925[1][3]. This adoption came after a series of developments in Iran's calendar system:

1. In 1911, during the Constitutional Revolution, a version of the Persian solar calendar with the Hijra as its starting point was adopted due to the need for more accurate and universal timekeeping[2].

2. Towards the end of 1303 Solar Hijri (SH), which corresponds to early 1925 CE, a group of representatives in the fifth period of the Iranian Parliament proposed a law to change the Arabic names of the months to Persian names[3].

3. After debates, in the 148th meeting of the Parliament on 11 Farvardin 1304 SH (March 31, 1925), it was decided that Persian names would be used for months starting from the year 1304 SH[3].

4. The law passed on this date established the Solar Hijri calendar as the official Iranian calendar[3]. It included the following key points:
   a) The origin of the calendar would be the Prophet Muhammad's migration from Mecca to Medina.
   b) The beginning of the year would be the first day of spring (Nowruz).

This calendar system combined elements of Iran's pre-Islamic heritage (solar calendar and Persian month names) with its Islamic identity (using the Hijra as the starting point). It has remained the official calendar of Iran since then, despite some challenges and attempted changes over the years[2].
