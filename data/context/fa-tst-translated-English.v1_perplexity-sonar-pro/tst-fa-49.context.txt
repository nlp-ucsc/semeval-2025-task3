The first technology accelerator in Iran was established in Tehran in 2014. Specifically, Avatech was the first accelerator to be founded in Iran that year[4]. 

After Avatech's establishment, there was a wave of accelerator creation that began in 2016[4]. This marked the start of a broader movement to develop Iran's startup and innovation ecosystem.

Some key points about the early development of accelerators and innovation centers in Iran:

- While incubators had existed since 2000, accelerators were a newer concept that emerged later[4].

- The period from 2014-2020 saw increased government support for startups and innovation infrastructure like accelerators[4].

- In 2014, several private and governmental investment firms, venture capital firms, angel investors, accelerators, and incubators were established to drive ecosystem development[4].

- The Innovation Acceleration Center was founded in 2014 (1393 in the Iranian calendar) to help organize and support accelerators and entrepreneurial events across Iran[3][5].

So while innovation support structures like incubators existed earlier, Tehran saw the establishment of Iran's first true startup accelerator in 2014, kicking off accelerator growth in the country's capital and beyond in subsequent years.
