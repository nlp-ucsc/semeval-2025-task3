The first constitution of Iran was ratified in 1906. Specifically, it was ratified on December 30, 1906 during the reign of Muzaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar[1][2].

This constitution, known as the Persian Constitution of 1906 or the Iranian Constitution of 1906, was a result of the Persian Constitutional Revolution. It marked a significant milestone in Iranian history as it established Iran's first parliament (Majlis) and limited the absolute power of the Shah[2].

Some key points about this constitution:

1. It was promulgated in the reign of Muzaffar ad-Din Shah and ratified by him on December 30, 1906[1].

2. The constitution established the National Consultative Assembly (Majlis), which represented the people of Persia and allowed them to participate in the country's economic and political affairs[1].

3. It initially consisted of a preamble and 51 articles[3].

4. The constitution was supplemented with additional articles in October 1907, expanding it to include 107 supplementary articles[3].

5. It was modeled partly on the Belgian constitution and guaranteed citizens equality before the law, as well as safeguarding personal honor, property, and speech[2].

This 1906 constitution remained theoretically in force, with some amendments, until the Iranian Revolution of 1979, when it was replaced by the current Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran[5].
