The Hyrcanian forests are home to a rich diversity of animal species, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. Here's a detailed overview of the animal species found in these ancient forests:

## Mammals

The Hyrcanian forests support a variety of mammal species, with 58 species recorded in total[1][4]. Some of the notable mammals include:

- **Large predators**: 
  - Persian Leopard (iconic and endangered)[1][3][6]
  - Brown Bear[3][4][6]
  - Wolf[3][4][6]
  - Golden Jackal[3][4]

- **Other mammals**:
  - Wild Goat[1]
  - Wild Boar[3][4]
  - Jungle Cat[3][4]
  - Lynx[4]
  - Badger[4]
  - Roe Deer[7]
  - Red Deer[7]

- **Small mammals**:
  - 18 bat species[10]
  - Hirkan Field Mouse (endemic)[7]

## Birds

The Hyrcanian forests are a haven for numerous bird species, with 180 to 296 species recorded[1][3]. Some notable bird species include:

- Steppe Eagle[1]
- European Turtle Dove[1]
- Eastern Imperial Eagle[1]
- European Roller[1]
- Semicollared Flycatcher[1]
- Caspian Tit[1]
- Common Wood Pigeon[3]
- Jay[3]
- Shrike[3]
- Common Buzzard[3]
- Lesser Spotted Eagle[3]
- Caucasian Black Grouse[6]
- Caspian Pheasant[6]

## Reptiles and Amphibians

The herpetofauna of the Hyrcanian forests is diverse, with over 30 reptile species and several endemic amphibians[10]. Some notable species include:

- Steiner's Lacerta (endemic)[7]
- Cave Salamander (endemic)[7]

## Fish

The streams and creeks of the Hyrcanian Forest region are home to more than 50 species of native freshwater fish[10].

The Hyrcanian forests serve as a critical refuge for many rare, endemic, and relict species, making them of immense ecological and scientific importance[10]. The unique combination of geographical isolation and long-term evolution has resulted in a high degree of endemism across various taxonomic groups[10], contributing to the forests' status as a UNESCO World Heritage site and their significance for global biodiversity conservation.
