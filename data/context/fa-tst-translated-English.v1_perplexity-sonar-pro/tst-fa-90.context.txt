According to the Iran Statistical Yearbook for the year 1391 (which covers data from 1390 or 2011 in the Gregorian calendar), the mean age of marriage for men in Iran in 1390 was 29.8 years[9]. This figure represents the average age at which men in Iran were getting married during that specific year.

It's worth noting that this average age has been increasing over time in Iran. For context, in 1355 (1976-1977), the average age of first marriage for men was 24.1 years[1]. By 1395 (2016-2017), it had increased to 27.4 years for men[1]. The trend of increasing marriage age has continued, with more recent data from 2024 indicating that the mean age for marriage for men had risen to 29.5 years[4].

This gradual increase in the average marriage age for men in Iran reflects broader social and economic changes in the country, including factors such as:

1. Increased educational attainment
2. Economic challenges, including unemployment
3. Changing social norms and expectations
4. Urbanization and modernization

These factors have contributed to a general trend of delayed marriage in Iran, which is consistent with patterns observed in many other countries around the world.
