The identification of the first Iranian novel is a subject of some debate among scholars, but there are a few key works that are often cited as pioneering examples of the novel form in Persian literature:

1. "The Blind Owl" (Buf-e Kur) by Sadeq Hedayat, published in 1937, is widely considered the first modern novel in Persian literature[6]. This surrealist-melancholic masterpiece is recognized as a groundbreaking work that introduced modernist techniques to Persian fiction[9].

2. However, some scholars trace the origins of the Iranian novel further back. Mohammad-Ali Jamalzadeh's collection of short stories "Yeki Bud Yeki Nabud" ("Once Upon a Time"), published in 1921 in Berlin, is often cited as the beginning of modern Persian prose fiction[5]. While not a novel per se, it marked a significant turning point in the development of modern Iranian literature.

3. Interestingly, the first major Iranian novel often mentioned is actually a Persian translation of James Morier's "The Adventure of Hajji Baba of Ispahan" (1824), translated by Mirza Habib Isfahani between 1835 and 1893[5]. This work, though originally written in English, played a significant role in shaping the early Iranian novel tradition.

4. Some Persian scholars argue that even earlier works could be considered as novels, such as "One Thousand and One Nights," "Samak Ayar," "Eskandar-nameh" (c. 1202 A.D.), and "Darah Nameh" (12th century)[1][7]. However, these classifications are debated among literary historians.

It's important to note that the development of the novel in Iran was a gradual process, influenced by both traditional Persian storytelling and Western literary forms. The works of authors like Jamalzadeh, Hedayat, and others in the early 20th century were crucial in establishing the novel as a distinct and respected form of Persian literature.
