Amir Kabir was the founder of both Dar ul-Funun and the Vaghaye Etefaghieh newspaper[1][5][6][10].

Amir Kabir, also known as Mirza Taghi Khan Amir-Nezam, was an influential statesman and reformer during the Qajar dynasty in Iran. He served as the prime minister (royal vizier) to Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, who reigned from 1848 to 1896[4][10].

Regarding Dar ul-Funun:
- Amir Kabir established Dar ul-Funun in 1851 in Tehran[1][4][6].
- It was Iran's first modern institution of higher education, aimed at teaching young Iranians modern sciences and military knowledge[6][10].
- The school was opened on December 27, 1851, just 13 days before Amir Kabir's assassination[1][6].

Regarding Vaghaye Etefaghieh newspaper:
- Amir Kabir also founded the Vaghaye Etefaghieh newspaper, which was the second Farsi publication in Iran's history[5].
- This newspaper played a significant role in modernizing Iran's media landscape during the Qajar era[5][8].

Amir Kabir's vision for both Dar ul-Funun and the Vaghaye Etefaghieh newspaper was to bridge the gap between traditional Iranian knowledge and modern Western sciences. These initiatives were part of his broader efforts to modernize Iran and strengthen its position on the global stage[10].

Unfortunately, Amir Kabir's reforms and progressive ideas led to his downfall. He was dismissed from his position as prime minister and subsequently assassinated in 1852, shortly after the establishment of Dar ul-Funun[6][10]. Despite his untimely death, Amir Kabir's legacy as a reformer and founder of these important institutions continues to be recognized in Iranian history.
