Abolhassan Banisadr was the first president of Iran after the Islamic Revolution of 1979[1][4][6]. He was elected on January 25, 1980, with 76% of the votes, and took office on February 4, 1980[6][1].

Banisadr's presidency was brief and tumultuous, lasting only about 16 months. Some key points about his tenure include:

1. Background: Banisadr was a close associate of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini during their exile in France and returned with him to Iran after the revolution[4].

2. Election: He won the presidency with Khomeini's support, becoming the first democratically elected president of the Islamic Republic[1][4].

3. Challenges: His presidency was marked by several significant events:
   - The ongoing U.S. Embassy hostage crisis[4]
   - The beginning of the Iran-Iraq War in 1980[4]
   - Deteriorating relations with neighboring Arab countries and the West[4]

4. Political conflicts: Despite being elected with Khomeini's backing, Banisadr soon found himself at odds with the clerical establishment[4][8]. He opposed the growing power of the clerics in the new government and faced challenges from the Revolutionary Guard[8].

5. Impeachment and exile: Banisadr was impeached by the Iranian parliament on June 21, 1981, and dismissed from office by Ayatollah Khomeini on June 22[1][4]. He then fled to France, where he lived in exile until his death in 2021[4][8].

Banisadr's short-lived presidency highlighted the complex power dynamics in post-revolutionary Iran, where the elected president's authority was ultimately subordinate to that of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khomeini[8][9].
