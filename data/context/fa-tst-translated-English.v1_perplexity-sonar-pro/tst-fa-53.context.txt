Iran won its first Olympic gold medals in wrestling at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia[1][3]. Specifically, two Iranian wrestlers achieved this historic milestone:

1. Emam-Ali Habibi won gold in the men's freestyle 67 kg weight class[1][3].

2. Gholamreza Takhti won gold in the men's freestyle 87 kg weight class[1][3].

These victories marked a significant moment for Iranian sports, as they were the country's first Olympic gold medals since their official debut at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. Prior to these gold medal wins, Iran had already won several silver and bronze medals in wrestling and weightlifting at previous Olympic Games, but the 1956 Melbourne Olympics represented their breakthrough to the top of the podium[1].

Wrestling has consistently been one of Iran's strongest Olympic sports. Since these initial gold medals, Iranian athletes have continued to excel in wrestling, as well as in other strength and combat sports like weightlifting and taekwondo, earning numerous medals in subsequent Olympic Games[7].
