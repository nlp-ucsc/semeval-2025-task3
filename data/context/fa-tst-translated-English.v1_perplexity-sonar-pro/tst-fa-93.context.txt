According to the 2011 report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), approximately 25% of the world's mammals are at risk of extinction[1][9].

To provide more context:

The IUCN Red List assessment revealed that at least 1,141 out of 5,487 known mammal species on Earth were threatened with extinction[1]. This represents about 21% of all mammal species. However, the actual percentage could be higher, potentially reaching up to 36%, due to data deficiency for many species[1].

Some key points from the assessment:

1. 188 mammal species were categorized as Critically Endangered, the highest threat category[1].

2. Nearly 450 mammals were listed as Endangered[1].

3. Habitat loss and degradation affected 40% of the world's mammals, with the impact being most severe in Central and South America, parts of Africa, Madagascar, and South and Southeast Asia[1].

4. Overharvesting was identified as a major threat, particularly for larger mammals in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa and South America[1].

5. The study also highlighted that conservation efforts can be effective, with 5% of currently threatened mammals showing signs of recovery in the wild[1].

It's important to note that the situation for mammals is part of a broader biodiversity crisis. The IUCN Red List at the time included 44,838 species across all taxonomic groups, with 16,928 (38%) threatened with extinction[1]. This underscores the urgent need for comprehensive conservation efforts to protect not just mammals, but biodiversity as a whole.
