The Shahnameh, the epic masterpiece by the Persian poet Ferdowsi, contains approximately 50,000 verses and was completed in 1010 CE[1][2][3].

Ferdowsi began writing the Shahnameh around 977 CE and dedicated over 30 years of his life to crafting this monumental work[2][3]. The poem consists of about 50,000 couplets (also called distichs or bayts), with each couplet containing two hemistichs (lines)[1][7]. This makes the Shahnameh one of the world's longest epic poems created by a single author[1].

Some key points about the Shahnameh's composition:

1. Duration: Ferdowsi spent approximately 33-35 years working on the epic[5][6].
2. Completion date: The work was finished on March 8, 1010 CE, when Ferdowsi was about 71-81 years old[2][5].
3. Structure: The epic is divided into 62 stories told across 990 chapters[6][7].
4. Content: It covers the mythical and historical past of the Persian Empire from the creation of the world until the Muslim conquest in the 7th century[1].

It's worth noting that the exact number of verses can vary slightly depending on the manuscript or edition. Some sources mention up to 60,000 verses[10], while others cite figures between 50,000 and 58,000[1][4]. This variation is due to different manuscript traditions and scholarly debates about the authenticity of certain verses.
