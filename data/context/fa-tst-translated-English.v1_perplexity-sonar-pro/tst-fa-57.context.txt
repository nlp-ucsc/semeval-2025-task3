The first football club in Iran was named Iran Club, established in 1920[3][5]. 

Iran Club was founded in Tehran and marked the beginning of organized club football in the country. This pioneering club consisted of notable players such as Karim Zandi, the Khan Sardar brothers, Amir-Aslani brothers, Mohammad Ali Shokooh, and several others[3]. 

It's worth noting that Iran Club achieved early success, winning the Tehran Association Cup in 1923[3]. However, the club's existence was relatively short-lived. In 1923, all of Iran Club's players moved to a newly formed club called Tehran Club[6].

While Iran Club was the first official football club, it's important to mention that football had been played in Iran earlier, albeit in a less organized manner:

1. As early as 1898, British residents in Esfahan played against a team of Armenians[3].
2. In 1907, British sailors and workers introduced the game in southwestern Iran[3].
3. The first Iranian player, Karim Zandi, played from 1908 to 1916[3].
4. In 1910, Samuel M. Jordan introduced football as part of the curriculum at the American School (now Alborz High School) in Tehran[3][5].

These earlier instances of football in Iran paved the way for the establishment of Iran Club in 1920, which marked the formal beginning of club football in the country.
