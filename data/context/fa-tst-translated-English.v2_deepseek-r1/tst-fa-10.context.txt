The Karun River originates from the Zagros Mountains in the Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province of Iran. It flows southwestward and eventually empties into the Arvand Rud (Shatt al-Arab) in the Khuzestan province of Iran. This river is significant as it is one of the largest and most important rivers in Iran.
