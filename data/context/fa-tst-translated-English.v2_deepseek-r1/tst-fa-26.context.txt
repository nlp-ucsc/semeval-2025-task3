The Iranian scientist who introduced algebra to the world of mathematics is renowned as Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi. He was a prominent mathematician, astronomer, and geographer during the Islamic Golden Age. Al-Khwarizmi's most famous work, "Kitab al-mukhtasar fi hisab al-jabr wa'l-muqabala" ("The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing"), is considered one of the foundational texts in algebra. The term "algebra" itself is derived from the Arabic word "al-jabr," which refers to the method of solving equations through balancing. Al-Khwarizmi's contributions not only established algebra as a distinct field of mathematics but also significantly influenced its development across the globe.
