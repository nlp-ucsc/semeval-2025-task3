The rate of land subsidence in Iran is significantly higher than in most developed countries. According to various studies and reports, the land subsidence rate in Iran can be several times higher, often ranging between 2 to 10 cm per year, depending on the region. This is particularly pronounced in urban areas such as Tehran, where subsidence rates have been reported to reach up to 10 cm annually.

In contrast, in many developed countries, such as the United States, Japan, and those in Western Europe, land subsidence rates are typically much lower, often less than 1 cm per year. These countries have implemented stricter regulations, better water management practices, and advanced engineering solutions to mitigate subsidence.

The primary causes of accelerated land subsidence in Iran include excessive groundwater extraction, particularly for agricultural purposes, which leads to the compaction of aquifers. Additionally, the construction of heavy infrastructure without adequate consideration of geological factors and the impacts of climate change exacerbate the problem. These factors contribute to the significantly higher rates of land subsidence in Iran compared to developed nations.
