Under the Abbasid Caliphate, the translation movement reached its peak primarily during the reigns of Caliph Al-Mansur (r. 754–775), Caliph Al-Mahdi (r. 775–785), and Caliph Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809). This period is often referred to as the "Golden Age" of Islamic scholarship and intellectual pursuits. 

Al-Mansur established Baghdad as the capital and laid the foundation for the House of Wisdom (Bayt al-Hikma), which became a central institution for translation and intellectual exchange. The movement gained momentum under Harun al-Rashid, who actively promoted the translation of Greek, Persian, and other texts into Arabic. This era saw scholars like Hunayn ibn Ishaq playing a key role in translating important works, which significantly contributed to the preservation and advancement of knowledge in various fields.
