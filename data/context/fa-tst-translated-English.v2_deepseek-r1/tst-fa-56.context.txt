Alright, so I need to figure out in which year the Iranian volleyball team first won a title in the world championships. As of my last update in July 2024, I can provide information up to that point. But I don't have real-time data beyond that.

First, I should clarify what is meant by "world championships." Volleyball has several international competitions, such as the FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship, the Olympic Games, and others. The question seems to be referring to the FIVB World Championship, which is held every four years.

Iran's men's volleyball team has been gaining prominence over the years. I recall that Brazil, Poland, and other teams have been strong contenders. However, I'm not immediately sure about Iran's performance in the World Championships.

I think it's helpful to consider Iran's recent achievements. They have had success in the Asian Games and have qualified for the Olympics, but I don't remember them winning a World Championship title. If they had, it would likely be after 2010, but I'm not certain.

To be accurate, I would need to refer to historical data, but based on what I know up to July 2024, I don't believe Iran has won a World Championship title in volleyball. They have made significant strides and won other tournaments, but not the FIVB World Championship. If there have been any recent events after my knowledge cutoff, that might have changed, but as of now, I think it's correct to say they haven't won the World Championship.

So, putting it all together, I can say that as of 2023, the Iranian men's volleyball team has not yet won a title in the FIVB World Championships. Their achievements include silver medals in the Asian Games and participation in the Olympics, but the World Championship title remains elusive for them.
