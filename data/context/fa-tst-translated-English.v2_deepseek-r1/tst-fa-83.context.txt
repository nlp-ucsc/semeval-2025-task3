Artificial Intelligence (AI) as an academic field began to take shape in the mid-20th century. The term "Artificial Intelligence" was first coined in 1956 during the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence, led by John McCarthy. This conference is often considered the birthplace of AI as a field of research. Since then, AI has grown into a significant and interdisciplinary academic discipline.
