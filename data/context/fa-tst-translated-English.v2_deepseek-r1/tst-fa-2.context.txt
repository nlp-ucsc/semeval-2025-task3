The battle recognized as a turning point in the end of the Sassanian Empire is the **Battle of al-Q훮disiyyah**. This decisive battle took place in 636 CE, near the present-day city of Hilla in Iraq. 

### Key Points about the Battle:
1. **Opposing Forces**:
   - The **Sassanid Empire**, led by General Rostam Farrokhz훮d, had a large but disorganized army.
   - The **Rashidun Caliphate**, under the leadership of Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, fielded a disciplined and determined force.

2. **Outcome**:
   - The Rashidun Caliphate decisively defeated the Sassanid forces, leading to the fall of the Sassanian capital, **Ctesiphon**.
   - The loss at al-Q훮disiyyah weakened the Sassanian Empire irreparably, making it difficult for them to recover and resist further Arab conquests.

3. **Significance**:
   - This battle marked the beginning of the end of the Sassanian Empire, which had been a major power in the region for centuries.
   - It paved the way for the spread of Islam across Persia (modern-day Iran) and beyond, leading to the eventual collapse of the Sassanian Empire by the mid-7th century.

The Battle of al-Q훮disiyyah is thus regarded as a pivotal moment in history, leading to the decline and eventual dissolution of the Sassanian Empire.
