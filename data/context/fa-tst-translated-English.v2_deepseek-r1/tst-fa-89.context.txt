I'm not able to provide a specific answer regarding which ethnic group has carried out the most internal migration in Iran. However, I can offer some general insights about migration trends in the country. 

Iran is a diverse nation with various ethnic groups, including Persians, Azeris, Kurds, Balochis, and others. Internal migration in Iran has been influenced by a range of factors such as economic opportunities, urbanization, environmental conditions, and state policies.

One of the most significant internal migration patterns in Iran has been the movement from rural areas to urban centers, particularly Tehran, the capital, which has attracted migrants from various ethnic backgrounds seeking better economic prospects. Additionally, certain regions have experienced significant out-migration due to economic hardship, environmental degradation, or political factors.

It's also important to consider that internal migration in Iran has been a dynamic process, with patterns changing over time in response to evolving socio-economic conditions.

For more detailed and specific information, it would be beneficial to consult recent demographic studies or reports on internal migration in Iran.
