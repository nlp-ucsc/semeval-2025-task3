The Treaty of Turkmenchay was signed on February 21, 1828. It was concluded between the Russian Empire and Qajar Iran, marking the end of the Russo-Persian War of 1826â€“1828. The key provisions of the treaty included the cession of several territories from Iran to Russia, specifically the Erivan Khanate and the Nakhchivan Khanate, which correspond to much of present-day Armenia. Additionally, the treaty granted Russia exclusive rights to navigate the Caspian Sea and gave Russian merchants favorable trade concessions in Iran. The treaty significantly shifted the balance of power in the region, strengthening Russian influence in the Caucasus.
