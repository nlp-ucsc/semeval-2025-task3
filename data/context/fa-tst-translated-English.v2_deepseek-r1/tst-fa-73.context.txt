The founder of Dar ul-Funun and the Vaqayye-ye Ettefaqiyya newspaper was Amir Kabir, also known as Mirza Taghi Khan Farahani. He was a prominent Iranian politician and reformer during the Qajar era, serving as the Prime Minister of Iran from 1848 to 1851. Amir Kabir is celebrated for his progressive reforms and efforts to modernize Iran, particularly in education and administration. He established Dar ul-Funun, Iran's first modern university, which aimed to introduce Western education and technology to the country. Additionally, he founded the Vaqayye-ye Ettefaqiyya newspaper, one of the first modern newspapers in Iran, which focused on spreading news and promoting public awareness. Amir Kabir's innovations were significant but were cut short when he was dismissed and eventually assassinated in 1852.
