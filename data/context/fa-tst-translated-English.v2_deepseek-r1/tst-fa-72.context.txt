The Achaemenid Empire, which was a vast and influential empire under the rule of the Achaemenid dynasty, is estimated to have governed a significant portion of the world's population at its peak. Specifically, it controlled approximately **40% to 45%** of the global population. This was during the 5th and 6th centuries BCE, under emperors such as Darius I and Xerxes I. The empire's extensive territories included regions in modern-day Iran, Egypt, Anatolia (Turkey), Mesopotamia (Iraq), the Levant (Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan), and parts of Central Asia, the Caucasus, and the Balkans.

The Achaemenid Empire's ability to manage such a large and diverse population was due in part to its efficient administrative systems, including the use of satrapies (provinces governed by satraps, or local governors) and a complex communication network that facilitated governance across vast distances. However, it's important to note that the exact percentage of the world's population under Achaemenid rule can vary depending on historical estimates of both the empire's population and the total world population during that time. Nonetheless, it is widely recognized that the Achaemenid Empire was one of the largest empires of the ancient world in terms of both land area and population.
