The first Iranian satellite, named Omid (which means "Hope" in Persian), was successfully launched into space on February 2, 2009. This satellite was launched using the Safir rocket, a two-stage solid-fuel rocket developed by Iran. Omid was a data-processing satellite designed to test satellite technology and telecommunications. The successful launch of Omid marked a significant milestone in Iran's space program, demonstrating its capability to launch satellites independently.
