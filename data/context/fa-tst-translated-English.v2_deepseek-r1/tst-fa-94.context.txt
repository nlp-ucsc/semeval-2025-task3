The Hyrcanian forests are aﾆﾆﾆﾆ

Okay, the user is asking about which province in Iran has the largest Hyrcanian forest. I remember that Hyrcanian forests are in the north of Iran, along the Caspian Sea. They run across several provinces, but I think one of them is the largest.

I'm pretty sure Mazandaran is one of the provinces with a significant portion of these forests. It's a well-known area for its natural beauty. Maybe it's the largest? Or could it be Golestan? I think Golestan also has a big part of the Hyrcanian forests. I should verify which one is larger between the two. Wait, I've heard that Golestan actually has the largest area of these forests. Mazandaran's forests are also extensive, but perhaps Golestan covers a bigger chunk. I need to make sure about this to give an accurate answer.

Also, I should explain a bit about the Hyrcanian forests, maybe mention why they're significant, like their biodiversity. That way, the user gets a comprehensive answer. I don't want to just list the province; providing some context would be better.

So, putting it all together, I'll state that the Hyrcanian forests stretch across several provinces and specify that Golestan has the largest portion. Then, I'll add a bit about their significance and location.
The Hyrcanian forests, a UNESCO World Heritage site, are primarily located in the northern part of Iran, bordering the Caspian Sea. Among the provinces where these forests are found, Golestan Province is home to the largest portion of these ancient and biodiverse woodlands. These forests are not only significant for their natural beauty but also for their rich ecosystems and history.
