As of my knowledge cutoff in July 2024, Iran has a total of 25 wetlands designated as Wetlands of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention. These sites are recognized for their significant ecological and conservation value. For the most current information, please refer to the latest updates from the Ramsar Convention Secretariat or relevant Iranian environmental authorities.
