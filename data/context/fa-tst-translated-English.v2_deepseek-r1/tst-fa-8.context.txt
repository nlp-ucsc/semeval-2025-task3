The historical event that led to the establishment of the Pahlavi dynasty was the **Persian Constitutional Revolution of 1905-1911**. This revolution aimed to limit the absolute monarchy of the Qajar dynasty and introduce constitutional reforms. However, the dynasty that actually came to power was the Pahlavi dynasty.

### Key Event:
The **coup d'état of 1921**, led by **Reza Khan** (later Reza Shah Pahlavi), marked the beginning of the Pahlavi dynasty. Reza Khan, a former Cossack officer, seized power and eventually deposed the last Qajar ruler, Ahmad Shah Qajar, in 1925. He established the Pahlavi dynasty, which ruled Iran until the 1979 Iranian Revolution.

### Conclusion:
The **1921 coup d'état** led by Reza Khan was the direct event that established the Pahlavi dynasty, ending the Qajar rule and setting the stage for modernization and authoritarian rule in Iran.
