The first president of Iran after the Islamic Revolution was Abolhassan Banisadr. He served from January 4, 1980, until his impeachment on June 21, 1981. Banisadr was elected during the first presidential election in Iran following the 1979 revolution that overthrew the Shah and established the Islamic Republic. His tenure was marked by political tensions, particularly with the Islamic Republican Party and the religious leadership, leading to his removal from office.
