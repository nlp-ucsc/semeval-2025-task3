The age group that constitutes the largest population in Iran varies over time due to demographic changes. As of the most recent data available up to July 2024, Iran has been experiencing a demographic shift. Historically, the country had a relatively young population due to high fertility rates in previous decades. However, fertility rates have declined significantly, leading to an aging population.

### **Current Demographics (as of recent estimates):**
- **Youth Population (15-24 years):** A significant portion of Iran's population is young, but this group is no longer the largest. The youth population has been declining as fertility rates decrease.
- **Working-Age Population (25-64 years):** This is the largest age group in Iran. The majority of the population falls within this range, making it the most populous segment.
- **Elderly Population (65 years and older):** This segment is growing as life expectancy increases and fertility rates decline, but it still constitutes a smaller percentage compared to the working-age group.

### **Key Factors Influencing Demographics:**
1. **Declining Fertility Rates:** Iran's total fertility rate (TFR) has dropped significantly, from around 6.5 children per woman in the 1980s to below replacement levels (around 2 children per woman) in recent years. This decline is due to urbanization, education, and government family planning policies.
2. **Aging Population:** As the fertility rate decreases and life expectancy increases, the proportion of elderly individuals in the population is growing.
3. **Government Policies:** Past policies aimed at controlling population growth, such as the "Two Children Is Enough" campaign, have contributed to the demographic shift.

### **Conclusion:**
As of the latest data up to July 2024, the largest age group in Iran is the working-age population (25-64 years). This group drives the economy and societal trends, while the country gradually moves towards an aging population structure.
