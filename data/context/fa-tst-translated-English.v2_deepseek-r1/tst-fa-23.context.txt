The Nastaliq script, which is a calligraphic style of the Arabic script, reached its peak during the Timurid dynasty (1370-1507) and the subsequent Safavid dynasty (1501-1736) in Greater Iran. This period, often referred to as the "Golden Age" of Persian calligraphy, saw Nastaliq being refined and widely used for both literary and artistic purposes. Prominent calligraphers like Mir Ali al-Husayni and Sultan Ali Mashhadi played significant roles in perfecting the script during this time.
