The first constitution of Iran was adopted in 1906. It established Iran as a constitutional monarchy and provided for a parliamentary system of government, with a bicameral legislature known as the Majlis. This constitution was a significant step towards modernizing Iran's political structure and limiting the absolute power of the Shah.
