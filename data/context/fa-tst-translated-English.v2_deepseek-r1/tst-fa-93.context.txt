The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) report in 2011 indicated that approximately 25% of the world's mammals are at risk of extinction. This assessment highlights the significant threat to global biodiversity, with many species facing challenges such as habitat loss, climate change, pollution, and overexploitation. The report underscores the urgent need for conservation efforts to protect these species and their ecosystems.
