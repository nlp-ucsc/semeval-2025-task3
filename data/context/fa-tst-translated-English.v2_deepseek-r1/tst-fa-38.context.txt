The book "Kalila wa Dimna" was translated into Persian by Abdullah ibn al-Muqaffa in the 8th century. This translation from Arabic played a significant role in spreading the stories into Persian literature and subsequently influenced various other translations into different languages. Abdullah ibn al-Muqaffa is often credited with popularizing these fables in the Islamic Golden Age.
