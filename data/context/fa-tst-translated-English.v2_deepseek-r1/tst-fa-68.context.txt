The Hyrcanian forests, spanning across northern Iran and part of Azerbaijan, are one of the most biodiverse regions in the world. Here are some key animal species found there:

1. **Persian Leopard**: One of the rarest and most endangered big cats in the world, the Persian leopard is a apex predator in the region.

2. **Eurasian Lynx**: A medium-sized wild cat, the lynx is well-adapted to the forest environment.

3. **Brown Bear**: The Hyrcanian forests provide habitat for a healthy population of brown bears.

4. **Wolf**: Gray wolves roam the forests and surrounding areas.

5. **Wild Boar**: A common species in these forests, wild boars are adaptable and widespread.

6. ** Roe Deer**: Also known as the European roe deer, this species is abundant in the Hyrcanian forests.

7. **Red Deer**: Also present, with a smaller population compared to roe deer.

8. **Caucasian Black Grouse**: This bird species is native to the region and found in the Hyrcanian forests.

9. **Hoopoe**: A colorful bird with distinctive calls and plumage.

10. **Moroccan Cypress**: While not an animal, this ancient tree species is a unique part of the forest ecosystem.

These species thrive in the region due to the unique microclimate created by the Caspian Sea. The forests provide essential habitat for many animals, and conservation efforts are necessary to protect this biodiversity hotspot.
