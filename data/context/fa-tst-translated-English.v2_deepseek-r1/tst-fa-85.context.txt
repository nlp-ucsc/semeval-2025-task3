The National Elites Foundation of Iran, also known as the "Bonyad-e Mellat," was established after the 1979 Iranian Revolution. The foundation is responsible for identifying, supporting, and employing Iran's top talents and elites in various fields.

However, I don't have access to specific information about who was elected as the head of the National Elites Foundation in the year 1392 of the Persian calendar, which corresponds to 2013-2014 in the Gregorian calendar.

If you have access to more specific historical records or official announcements from that time, they would likely provide the most accurate information.
