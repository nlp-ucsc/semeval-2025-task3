The desert in Iran that has been registered as one of the hottest places on Earth is **Lut Desert**, also known as **Dasht-e Lut**. It holds the record for the highest surface temperature ever reliably recorded on Earth, reaching **80.8°C (177.4°F)** in 2005, as measured by NASA's MODIS instrument. This extreme heat is due to its unique geography and arid conditions.

**Key Points:**

1. **Location:** The Lut Desert is located in the southeastern part of Iran, predominantly in the provinces of Kerman and Sistan-Baluchestan.

2. **Hottest Surface Temperature:** While the air temperature is extremely high, the surface temperature recorded in the Lut Desert (80.8°C) is the highest ever measured globally.

3. **Why So Hot?** The desert's dark volcanic rocks and lack of vegetation contribute to its extreme heat. These factors absorb and retain sunlight, leading to record-breaking surface temperatures.

4. **UNESCO World Heritage Site:** The Lut Desert was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2016 due to its unique natural features and extreme climatic conditions.

5. **Unique Landforms:** The desert is known for its **"kaluts"**, which are large, crescent-shaped dunes formed by strong winds.

In summary, the Lut Desert in Iran is renowned for its record-breaking heat and unique geological features.
