As of my last update in July 2024, I don't have specific information about which bank in Iran first implemented automatic payment systems. The banking industry in Iran has been evolving with the adoption of technology, and many banks now offer digital services, but details about the first bank to introduce automatic payments might require more up-to-date or specialized sources. If you need accurate and current information, I recommend checking recent resources or official banking announcements from Iran.
