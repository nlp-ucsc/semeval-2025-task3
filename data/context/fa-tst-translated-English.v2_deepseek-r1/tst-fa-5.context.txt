The capital of the Parthian Empire was **Ctesiphon**. However, the Parthians also used other cities as seasonal or secondary capitals, such as **Ecbatana** and **Hecatompylos**. Ctesiphon, located along the Tigris River in modern-day Iraq, was the most notable and frequently used capital, especially during the later periods of the empire. It served as the royal residence and a center of administration and culture.
