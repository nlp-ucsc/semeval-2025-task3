Lake Urmia, located in Iran, faced significant challenges due to environmental factors such as drought and water diversion projects, leading to a substantial reduction in its surface area over the years. By the year 1400 in the Persian calendar, which corresponds to 2021 in the Gregorian calendar, Lake Urmia retained approximately 10% to 20% of its original area. This drastic reduction highlights the severe environmental impact on the lake and its ecosystem.
