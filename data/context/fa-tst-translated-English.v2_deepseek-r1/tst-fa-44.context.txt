The Divan of Hafez, which is the collected works of the Persian poet Hafez of Shiraz, was first published in its complete form after his death. Hafez lived in the 14th century, specifically from 1325/1326 to 1390. The compilation and publication of his poetry into a Divan occurred posthumously, primarily by his students and admirers. The exact year of the first publication is not certain, but it is believed to have been published in the early 15th century, during the Timurid Empire.

So, while Hafez wrote his poems during his lifetime in the 14th century, the actual publication of his Divan as we know it today happened after his death, likely in the early 15th century.
