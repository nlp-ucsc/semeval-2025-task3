The annual number of deaths in Iran attributable to air pollution is difficult to pinpoint with exactness, as it can vary based on factors like pollution levels, prevalent policies, and even seasonal changes. However, studies suggest that air pollution contributes significantly to health issues in Iran, particularly in major cities such as Tehran. Air pollution is linked to various health conditions, including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, which can lead to premature deaths. It's estimated that thousands of deaths each year in Iran may be associated with poor air quality. For precise data, consulting recent reports from organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) or local environmental agencies would be beneficial, as they provide updated statistics and analyses.
