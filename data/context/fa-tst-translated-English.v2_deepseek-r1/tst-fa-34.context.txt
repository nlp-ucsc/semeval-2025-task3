The first presidential election in Iran was held on January 25, 1980. This election took place after the establishment of the Islamic Republic following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, which overthrew the monarchy led by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Abolhassan Banisadr won this election and became the first President of Iran. However, his presidency was short-lived; he was impeached by the Iranian parliament in June 1981 and later executed in 1998.
