Moshood Abiola ran as the presidential candidate for the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in the Nigerian presidential election held on June 12, 1993[1][2][4]. 

The 1993 election was a two-party race between Abiola's SDP and the National Republican Convention (NRC), whose candidate was Bashir Tofa[1]. This election was part of a transition process from military to civilian rule that was initiated by the military government of Ibrahim Babangida[1].

The election was widely regarded as free and fair, with observers declaring it the freest and fairest in Nigerian history up to that point[8]. Unofficial results indicated that Abiola had won a clear majority, receiving 58.36% of the vote compared to 41.64% for Tofa[1]. Abiola appeared to have garnered support across ethnic and religious divides, winning in 19 out of 30 states plus the Federal Capital Territory[1][3].

However, before the official results could be announced, General Babangida annulled the election, citing alleged irregularities[1][8]. This annulment led to a major political crisis in Nigeria, with Abiola attempting to claim the presidency he appeared to have won[8]. His actions ultimately led to his arrest on treason charges in 1994 by the subsequent military regime of General Sani Abacha[8].
