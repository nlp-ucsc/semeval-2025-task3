The dwarf planet candidate Chaos (19521 Chaos) has an orbital period of approximately 309 years[4][7]. More precisely:

- Some sources list the orbital period as 309.1006 years[3][7].
- Another source gives a slightly longer period of 309.92 years[4].
- One source rounds it to 312.11 years[1].

Chaos orbits the Sun in the Kuiper Belt region beyond Neptune[1][7]. It follows an eccentric orbit with an average distance from the Sun of about 45.6 AU (astronomical units)[3]. At its closest approach to the Sun (perihelion), Chaos comes within about 41 AU, while at its farthest point (aphelion), it reaches nearly 51 AU from the Sun[1][3].

The relatively long orbital period of over 300 years is typical for objects in the outer Solar System. For comparison, Neptune's orbital period is about 165 years, while Pluto's is about 248 years[2]. Chaos's greater average distance from the Sun results in its longer orbital period.

It's worth noting that Chaos is considered a potential dwarf planet candidate, but it has not been officially classified as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union (IAU)[1][7]. Its size is estimated to be around 560-600 km in diameter, making it one of the larger objects in the Kuiper Belt[3][5].
