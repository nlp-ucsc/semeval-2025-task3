Hans Egede's oldest son was named Poul (also spelled Paul) Egede[1][2][4]. 

Poul Egede was born in 1708 and grew up in Greenland with his family[2]. He learned the Greenlandic language quickly as a child and later played a significant role in continuing his father's missionary work:

1. When Hans Egede left Greenland in 1736, Poul remained behind to carry on the mission[2][4].

2. Poul worked with Greenlandic assistants to produce the first Greenlandic translation of the New Testament in 1766[2].

3. He also created a dictionary of the Greenlandic language, which was important for the development of Greenlandic literature[2].

4. In 1740, Poul began serving as an aide to his father in the Seminarium Groenlandicum (Greenland Mission Seminary) in Copenhagen[1].

5. When Hans Egede resigned from leading the seminary in 1747, Poul took over his position[1].

Poul Egede's contributions were crucial in continuing and expanding upon the missionary and linguistic work his father had begun in Greenland.
