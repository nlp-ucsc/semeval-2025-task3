The Jomsvikings were a legendary group of Viking warriors whose exact location has been the subject of much debate among historians and archaeologists. However, based on the available information, we can provide some details about their purported location:

## Jomsborg Fortress

The Jomsvikings were said to be based at a stronghold called Jomsborg. This fortress was reportedly located on the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, in an area that was known as medieval Wendland and is now part of modern Pomerania[1][2]. 

## Possible Locations

Several locations have been proposed for the site of Jomsborg:

1. Wolin: The most commonly suggested location is near the present-day town of Wolin in northwestern Poland. This site is on the southeastern tip of the isle of Wolin, possibly at Srebrna Góra hill north of the town[1].

2. Usedom: Some theories place Jomsborg in the northwest of nearby Usedom island, on lands now submerged. This includes areas between the small islands of Ruden and Greifswalder Oie, and the Peenemünde shoals[1].

3. Other Baltic Coast Sites: While Wolin is the most frequently cited location, the exact site of Jomsborg remains unconfirmed, and other areas along the southern Baltic coast have been proposed.

## Recent Archaeological Findings

In 2023, Polish archaeologist Dr. Wojciech Filipowiak suggested he may have found evidence of Jomsborg near the island of Wolin. Excavations at an area known as Hangmen's Hill revealed charred traces of wooden structures, which the researcher interprets as the remains of a burnt 10th-century rampart. A wooden pier that could have served a Viking-era trading post was also discovered nearby[6].

## Historical Context

It's important to note that the existence of Jomsborg as a physical place is still debated among historians. The Jomsvikings appear primarily in Icelandic sagas from the 12th and 13th centuries, which were written long after the events they describe. There are no contemporary sources that specifically mention "Jomsvikings" or "Jomsborg"[2][5].

## Timeframe

According to the sagas, Jomsborg existed between the 960s and 1043. Some sources attribute its founding to the Danish king Harald Bluetooth in the 960s, while others credit the Viking leader Palnatoke[1][3].

While the exact location of the Jomsvikings remains a mystery, the legend of these fierce Viking warriors continues to captivate historians and enthusiasts alike. Ongoing archaeological work, particularly in the Wolin area, may yet shed more light on this intriguing aspect of Viking history.
