Catherine McCormack played the role of Murron MacClannough in the 1995 epic historical drama film "Braveheart"[1][2][3]. Murron was William Wallace's childhood friend who later became his secret wife[2]. Her character is crucial to the plot of the film, as her tragic fate becomes the catalyst for Wallace's rebellion against the English[2].

In the film, Murron and Wallace reunite as adults when Wallace returns to his hometown. They fall in love and marry in secret to avoid the English law of primae noctis[2]. Tragically, Murron is captured and executed by English soldiers, which drives Wallace to seek revenge and ignites the rebellion that forms the main plot of the film[2].

McCormack's portrayal of Murron, though brief, is significant and memorable. Her character represents the personal motivation behind Wallace's larger fight for Scottish independence. The scenes between McCormack and Mel Gibson (who played William Wallace) helped establish the emotional core of the film[1][6].

"Braveheart" was a major breakthrough for McCormack's career. It was one of her earliest film roles and brought her international recognition[3]. The film's massive success opened up new opportunities for her in both Hollywood and British productions[7].
