The Danish Golden Age refers to a period of exceptional creative and intellectual production in Denmark, primarily during the first half of the 19th century. While there is some variation in the exact dates, most sources agree on the following timeframe:

The Danish Golden Age is generally considered to have occurred between 1800 and 1850, with some scholars extending it to 1864[1][2][4]. This period encompasses significant developments in various fields, including art, literature, philosophy, science, and architecture.

Key aspects of the Danish Golden Age include:

1. Artistic Flourishing: The era is most commonly associated with the Golden Age of Danish Painting, featuring renowned artists such as Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, Christen Købke, and Constantin Hansen[2].

2. Historical Context: The Golden Age began during a challenging time for Denmark, following the Napoleonic Wars, the British bombardment of Copenhagen in 1807, and the state bankruptcy in 1813[1][2].

3. Intellectual Achievements: The period saw contributions from notable figures like Hans Christian Andersen in literature, Søren Kierkegaard in philosophy, and Hans Christian Ørsted in science[1][2].

4. Architectural Developments: Copenhagen underwent significant changes with the construction of Neoclassical buildings designed by architects like Christian Frederik Hansen[2].

5. Cultural Renaissance: Despite political and economic challenges, Denmark experienced a reassessment of national character and purpose, leading to a cultural flowering[1].

6. Extended Timeframe: Some scholars, including the organizers of recent exhibitions, extend the Golden Age to 1864, marking its end with Denmark's defeat in the Second Schleswig War[1][4].

It's worth noting that the term "Golden Age" (Den danske guldalder) was not used contemporaneously. It was first applied to this period in 1890 by Danish philosopher Valdemar Vedel, and further popularized in 1896 by author Vilhelm Andersen[2].

In summary, when referring to the Golden Age of Denmark, one typically means the period from 1800 to 1850 (or 1864), characterized by exceptional achievements in arts, literature, philosophy, and sciences, despite the nation facing significant political and economic challenges.
