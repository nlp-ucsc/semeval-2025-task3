The American film "Police Academy" is actually not titled "Police Academy" in German. The German title for the 1984 comedy film "Police Academy" is "Polizeiacademy - DÃ¼mmer als die Polizei erlaubt" [1][2]. This translates to "Police Academy - Dumber than the Police Allows" in English.

Some additional details about the German release and reception of Police Academy:

1. The film was very popular in West Germany upon its release [8]. 

2. In Germany, as in many other countries, the film spawned a series of sequels that retained the "Police Academy" title, though often with different subtitles [2][4].

3. The German dubbing of the film likely contributed to its success in German-speaking countries, as comedy films often benefit from localized humor and voice acting.

4. While the main title remained "Polizeiacademy" for the German release, it's common for Hollywood films to have slightly altered titles or added subtitles when released in other countries to better appeal to local audiences or clarify the content.

It's worth noting that while the film's title was translated, the concept of a "police academy" exists in Germany as well, though it's typically called "Polizeischule" (police school) in German [5].
