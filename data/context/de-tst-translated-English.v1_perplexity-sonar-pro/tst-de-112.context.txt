The statement that "Arkade" comes from the Latin word "arcus" meaning "arch" is partially correct, but it oversimplifies the etymology. Let's explore the origins of this term more thoroughly:

The word "Arkade" (or "arcade" in English) does indeed have its roots in Latin, but it follows a more complex etymological path:

1. Latin origin: The ultimate source is the Latin word "arcus," which means "bow," "arch," or "arc"[1][5].

2. Italian intermediary: From Latin, the word evolved into Italian "arcata," meaning "arch of a bridge"[1][3].

3. French adaptation: The Italian "arcata" was then borrowed into French as "arcade"[1][3].

4. English adoption: The English word "arcade" was borrowed directly from French in the early 18th century (around 1731)[9].

5. Other languages: The term then spread to other languages, such as Dutch "arcade," which in turn influenced the Indonesian "arkade"[7].

The meaning of the word has evolved over time:

1. Initially, it referred to a series of arches supported by columns[1][2].
2. It later came to mean a covered passageway, often with shops on both sides[1][2].
3. In modern usage, it can also refer to an establishment with coin-operated games[1][2].

So while it's true that the ultimate origin of "Arkade" can be traced back to the Latin "arcus," the word underwent several transformations in different languages before arriving at its current form and meaning. This journey from Latin through Italian and French to English and other languages illustrates the complex nature of linguistic evolution and borrowing.
