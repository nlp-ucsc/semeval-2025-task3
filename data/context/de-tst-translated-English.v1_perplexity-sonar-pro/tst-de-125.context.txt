The De Lucchi Pavilion in the Groninger Museum, designed by Italian architect Michele de Lucchi, houses works by the artist group De Ploeg[3]. Specifically, the central rooms of this pavilion feature works by the Groningen De Ploeg artist collective and affiliated Northern European Expressionists[3].

De Ploeg was an important artist collective based in Groningen, Netherlands. The pavilion designed by De Lucchi was conceived as a brick bastion, referencing the historical fortifications that once existed at the museum's location[3]. This architectural choice creates an appropriate setting for displaying both historical artifacts and artworks, including the paintings by De Ploeg members.

In addition to De Ploeg works, this pavilion also exhibits other parts of the museum's permanent collection, including:

- Paintings of famous Groningen residents
- Silver objects
- Masterpieces from the museum's painting collection
- Modern and Postmodern art and design[3]

The inclusion of De Ploeg works in this historically-inspired pavilion helps to contextualize the group's importance to Groningen's artistic heritage alongside other significant cultural artifacts from the region.
