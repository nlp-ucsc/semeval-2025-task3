El Al Flight 402 was shot down on July 27, 1955 by Bulgarian fighter jets due to a series of unfortunate events and Cold War tensions[1][3]. Here are the key details:

The flight was en route from London to Tel Aviv, with scheduled stops in Vienna and Istanbul[1]. After departing Vienna, the Lockheed Constellation aircraft veered off course into Bulgarian airspace, likely due to a thunderstorm affecting navigation equipment or causing the pilot to change course to avoid turbulence[1].

The plane flew over Bulgaria for about 120 miles, during which time it was tracked by two Bulgarian MiG-15 fighter jets[1]. The Bulgarian pilots claimed to have issued several warnings before ultimately shooting down the Israeli plane just before it reached the Greek border[1].

The order to shoot down the plane came from Gen. Velitchko Georgiev, second in command of Bulgaria's air defenses, who stated: "If the plane is leaving our territory, disobeying orders, and there is no time left for more warnings, then shoot it down."[1][3]

Key factors that contributed to this tragic incident include:

1. Cold War tensions: Bulgaria was a Communist country aligned with the Soviet Union at the time, and non-Warsaw Pact aircraft were not allowed in its airspace[5].

2. Navigational error: The El Al pilots likely made an unintentional error due to weather conditions or equipment malfunction[1][5].

3. Miscommunication: There are conflicting accounts about whether proper warning procedures were followed before the shootdown[3].

4. Mistaken identity: Some reports suggest the Bulgarian pilots may not have clearly identified the aircraft as a civilian passenger plane[5].

The crash killed all 58 people on board - 51 passengers and 7 crew members[1][3]. Bulgaria acknowledged the incident the next day, expressed regret, and eventually paid compensation to the victims' families, though the amount was significantly less than what Israel initially sought[1][3].

This incident remains the only time in El Al's history that one of its aircraft was shot down[5]. It highlights the dangers of Cold War tensions and the tragic consequences that can result from misunderstandings and errors in high-stakes situations involving military forces and civilian aircraft.
