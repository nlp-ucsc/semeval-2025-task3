Ożarów was deprived of its town rights in 1869[2]. This occurred as part of a broader punitive action by the Russian authorities following the failed January Uprising against Russian rule. Many Polish cities and towns that had supported the independence movement were stripped of their city rights as punishment[2]. 

This action was not unique to Ożarów. For example, the nearby town of Tarłów also lost its town rights in 1869 for the same reason[4]. The loss of town rights was a significant setback for these communities, as it often resulted in reduced autonomy and economic opportunities.

Ożarów remained without town rights for over a century. It wasn't until 1988 that Ożarów regained its status as a town[2]. This long period without town rights likely had a significant impact on the development and governance of Ożarów throughout much of the late 19th and 20th centuries.
