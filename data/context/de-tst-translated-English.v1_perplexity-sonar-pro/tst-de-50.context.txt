The Aloadae in Greek mythology were twin giants named Otus (also spelled Otos) and Ephialtes[1][2][4]. They were the sons of Iphimedia and Poseidon, though they were sometimes referred to as the sons of Aloeus, from whom they derived their collective name Aloadae[1][2].

Some key details about the Aloadae:

1. Names and meanings:
   - Otus (Ὦτος) means "insatiate" or "doom"[1][7]
   - Ephialtes (Ἐφιάλτης) means "nightmare"[1][7]

2. Parentage:
   - Mother: Iphimedia (also spelled Iphimedeia)[1][2]
   - Father: Poseidon, though they were sometimes attributed to Aloeus[1][3]

3. Physical characteristics:
   - They were extraordinarily tall and strong giants[2]
   - By age nine, they were said to be 27 cubits (about 40 feet) tall and 9 cubits wide[2]
   - They grew at an astonishing rate of 3 cubits in height and 1 cubit in width each year[2]

4. Notable deeds:
   - They attempted to storm Mount Olympus by stacking mountains (Olympus, Ossa, and Pelion) on top of each other[1][4]
   - They imprisoned Ares, the god of war, in a bronze jar for thirteen months[1][3]
   - They were known for founding cities and introducing civilization to some areas[1]

The Aloadae met their end when they tried to capture Artemis and Hera as wives. Artemis tricked them by running between them as a deer, causing them to accidentally kill each other with their spears[4][7].
