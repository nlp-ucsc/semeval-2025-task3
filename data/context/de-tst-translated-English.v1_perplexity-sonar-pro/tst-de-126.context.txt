Chögyam Trungpa's home monastery was Surmang Monastery in eastern Tibet[1][2]. Specifically:

- He was recognized as the 11th incarnation of the Trungpa tulku lineage, which was associated with the Surmang group of monasteries[1].

- He held the title of Supreme Abbot of the Surmang monasteries[1].

- He was enthroned as the supreme abbot of Surmang Dutsi-tel Monastery, which was part of the Surmang monastic complex[5].

Surmang Monastery was located in the Kham region of eastern Tibet, where Chögyam Trungpa was born in 1939[1][2]. It was a significant Kagyu lineage monastery, and Trungpa received much of his early Buddhist education and training there before fleeing Tibet in 1959[5]. His role as the 11th Trungpa tulku and abbot of Surmang was central to his spiritual authority and training in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition.
