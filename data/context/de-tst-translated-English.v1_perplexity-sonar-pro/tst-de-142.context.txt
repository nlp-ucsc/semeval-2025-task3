Albert Fran√ßois Lebrun, the 15th President of the French Republic, was born on August 29, 1871, in Mercy-le-Haut, a commune in the Meurthe-et-Moselle department in northeastern France[1][2][7]. 

Regarding his burial, Albert Lebrun died on March 6, 1950, in Paris at the age of 78[2][7]. Following his death, a national funeral was held for him at Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris[2]. While the search results don't explicitly state where he was buried, they provide information about his funeral:

1. A national funeral service was held at Notre-Dame-de-Paris[2].
2. There's a photograph showing Lebrun's funeral ceremony taking place in Notre-Dame Cathedral on March 10, 1950[10].

It's common for French presidents and other notable figures to be buried in various locations after a state funeral at Notre-Dame. However, without more specific information, we cannot definitively state where Lebrun was ultimately interred. The national funeral at Notre-Dame was a significant honor reflecting his role as a former President of France, but it doesn't necessarily indicate his final resting place.
