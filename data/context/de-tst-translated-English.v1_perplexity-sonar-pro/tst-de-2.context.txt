I apologize, but I don't have any specific information about a Benedictine monastery called "Saint-Pierre de la Haute-Pierre" or its founding date in the provided search results. The search results contain information about several other Benedictine monasteries and abbeys, but none match the exact name you're asking about.

To provide a helpful response, I can share some general information about Benedictine monasteries in France based on the search results:

Many Benedictine monasteries in France were founded between the 7th and 11th centuries. For example:

1. The Abbey of Saint Peter in Les Preaux, Haute-Normandie has origins dating back to before the arrival of the Normans, with its existence referenced in a will from the early 9th century[1].

2. Hautvillers Abbey, or the Abbey of St Peter, Hautvillers, was founded in 650 by Saint Nivard, Bishop of Reims[2].

3. The Abbey of St. Solesmes was founded in 1010 by Geoffrey, seigneur of Sabl√©[3].

4. The Abbey of Saint-Pierre de la Couture was founded by Saint Bertrand, Bishop of Le Mans, who served from 586 to 616[4].

5. According to legend, Moissac Abbey was founded by the Frankish king Clovis in 506, though historical records indicate it was actually founded by Saint Didier, bishop of Cahors, in the middle of the 7th century[6].

If you have any additional information about the specific monastery you're inquiring about, such as its location or any historical figures associated with it, that might help in finding more relevant information.
