Agistri (also known as Angistri or Agkistri) belongs to the Saronic Islands group[1][6][7]. The Saronic Islands, also called the Argo-Saronic Islands, are an archipelago located in the Saronic Gulf, just off the Greek mainland near Athens[1].

The main islands that make up the Saronic Islands group include:

1. Salamis (the largest)
2. Aegina
3. Agistri
4. Poros
5. Hydra
6. Spetses
7. Dokos[1][6][8]

Agistri is one of the smaller islands in this group, with an area of about 13.367 kmÂ² (5.161 sq mi)[4]. It's located very close to the larger island of Aegina and can be reached from there by boat in just 10 minutes[1][2]. The island is known for its pine forests, beautiful beaches, and relatively quiet, less commercialized atmosphere compared to some of the more popular Greek islands[3][5].

Agistri is a popular destination for weekend getaways from Athens due to its proximity to the capital. It's only about an hour's boat ride from the port of Piraeus in Athens[2][5][8]. This makes it, along with the other Saronic Islands, easily accessible for both Greek and international tourists looking for a quick escape from the city.
