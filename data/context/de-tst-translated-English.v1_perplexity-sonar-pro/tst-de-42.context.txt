Based on the search results provided, there is no specific mention of a river crossing the French commune of Saint-Voir. The search results contain information about various rivers in France and some details about Saint-Voir, but they do not directly indicate which river, if any, crosses this particular commune.

Saint-Voir is described as a commune in the Allier department in the Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes region of central France[3][5]. However, the search results do not provide information about any river flowing through this specific commune.

To accurately answer which river crosses Saint-Voir, we would need additional information or more specific search results about the local geography of Saint-Voir. Without this information, I cannot definitively state which river, if any, crosses this commune.
