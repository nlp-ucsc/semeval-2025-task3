Cedric Liddell was active in the Leander Boat Club in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada[1]. As a member of this club, Liddell qualified to represent Canada at two editions of the Olympic Games during his rowing career[1]. The Leander Boat Club played a significant role in Liddell's rowing achievements:

1. Olympic Success: In 1932, Liddell won a bronze medal in the coxed eights as part of the Leander Boat Club crew at the Los Angeles Olympics[1].

2. Consecutive Victories: Liddell was a member of the Leander crews that won Canada's Henley Royal Regatta every year from 1932 through 1936[1].

3. Multiple Olympic Appearances: He represented the Leander Boat Club at both the 1932 and 1936 Olympic Games[1][2].

4. Continued Involvement: After the 1936 Olympics, Liddell switched to pairs rowing but continued to compete with the Leander Boat Club into the 1940s[1].

Liddell's affiliation with the Leander Boat Club was a crucial part of his rowing career, contributing to his national and international success in the sport.
