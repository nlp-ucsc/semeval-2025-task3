During British colonial rule, Zimbabwe was known by several names, reflecting different periods of its history:

1. South Zambezia: This was an early name used for the region before formal colonization[1].

2. Rhodesia: The name "Rhodesia" was adopted in 1895 by the British South Africa Company to honor Cecil Rhodes, who played a crucial role in the colonization of the area[1][4].

3. Southern Rhodesia: In 1898, the region was officially named Southern Rhodesia[4]. This name was used to distinguish it from Northern Rhodesia (present-day Zambia)[5].

4. Colony of Southern Rhodesia: In 1923, Southern Rhodesia became a self-governing British colony, officially known as the Colony of Southern Rhodesia[5][7].

5. Rhodesia: In 1964, after the breakup of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, the country briefly returned to being called simply "Rhodesia"[5].

6. Zimbabwe Rhodesia: This name was used for a short period in 1979 during the transition towards majority rule[5].

7. Southern Rhodesia (again): From December 12, 1979, to April 17, 1980, the country briefly reverted to being the British colony of Southern Rhodesia during the final transition to independence[5].

It's important to note that the name "Zimbabwe" was not used officially during colonial rule. The term "Zimbabwe" was first used as a reference to the country by African nationalists in the 1960s and became the official name upon independence in 1980[7].

The changes in nomenclature reflect the complex political history of the region, from company rule under the British South Africa Company to self-governing colony status, unilateral declaration of independence by the white minority government, and finally to majority rule and independence as Zimbabwe[2][3][6].
