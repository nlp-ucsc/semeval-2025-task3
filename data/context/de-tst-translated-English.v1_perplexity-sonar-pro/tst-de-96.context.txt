From 1798 to 1814, the Palatinate belonged to France[6][7]. 

In 1794, French revolutionary troops occupied the Left Bank of the Rhine, including the Palatinate. Following the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797, the First French Republic formally annexed the region[6][7]. In 1798, the French introduced a new administrative system, establishing departments in the annexed territories[7]. 

The area of the Palatinate was largely incorporated into the newly created DÃ©partement of Mont Tonnerre (Mont-Tonnerre in French)[6][7]. Some minor parts of the region were attached to the neighboring departments of Sarre and Bas-Rhin[7].

Under French rule, the Palatinate underwent significant administrative changes. The French subdivided the department into cantons, mayoralties, and municipalities. They also introduced their legal system (the Napoleonic Code) and the metric system[7].

This period of French control lasted until 1814, when Napoleon was defeated and abdicated. The Congress of Vienna in 1815 then reorganized the territories, with most of the Palatinate being given to the Kingdom of Bavaria as part of the Rhine Circle (Rheinkreis)[9].
