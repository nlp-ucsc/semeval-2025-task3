The University of Haifa is connected to its mountain station through a gondola lift system called the Rakavlit. This aerial tramway is part of Haifa's expanded public transport system[1][4].

Key details about the Rakavlit:

1. Route: It runs from the HaMifratz Central Bus Station at the foot of Mount Carmel to the Technion and then to the University of Haifa[1].

2. Distance and elevation: The total distance covered is 4.4 kilometers with an elevation gain of 460 meters[1][4].

3. Travel time: The journey from the Haifa Bay Central Station to the University of Haifa takes approximately 19 minutes[1].

4. Capacity: The system can transport up to 2,400 passengers per hour in each direction[1].

5. Accessibility: The cable cars are fully accessible to individuals with disabilities[1].

6. Operation: It was opened to the public in April 2022 after some delays[1].

7. Purpose: While it serves as a major tourist attraction, most passengers are expected to be students traveling to and from the University of Haifa and the Technion[4][8].

8. Integration: The Rakavlit is integrated with other public transportation options in Haifa, including buses and the Metronit bus rapid transit system[2].

This cable car system provides a unique and efficient means of transportation for students and visitors to access the University of Haifa, which is situated on the crest of Mount Carmel[2][5].
