The Battle of Long Island, also known as the Battle of Brooklyn or the Battle of Brooklyn Heights, was a decisive victory for the British forces[1][3][5][6]. This battle took place on August 27, 1776, and was the first major engagement after the United States declared its independence on July 4, 1776[1][3].

Key points about the British victory:

1. Outcome: The battle resulted in a clear British victory, allowing them to gain control of New York City[1][3].

2. Casualties: British losses were relatively light, with approximately 63 killed and 314 wounded. In contrast, American casualties were much higher, with an estimated 300 killed, 650 wounded, and about 1,100 captured or missing[1].

3. Strategic importance: This victory was part of the British campaign to seize control of New York and isolate New England from the rest of the colonies[3].

4. Military advantage: The British, commanded by Lt. Gen. William Howe, had superior numbers (22,000 soldiers) compared to the American forces (19,000 soldiers) led by Gen. George Washington[1].

5. Tactical success: The British successfully outflanked the American defenses by using the unguarded Jamaica Pass, surprising the Continental Army[4][5].

Despite the clear British victory, it's worth noting that George Washington managed to save a significant portion of his army through a skillful nighttime evacuation across the East River to Manhattan on August 29-30[3][5]. This retreat, while not changing the outcome of the battle itself, was crucial in preserving the Continental Army to fight another day.
