Papier collé is a specific form of collage art that originated in the early 20th century. The term, which translates from French as "pasted paper," refers to a technique where paper is adhered to a flat surface as part of an artistic composition[1][2].

Key characteristics of papier collé include:

1. Materials: It exclusively uses paper as the primary medium, unlike general collage which may incorporate various materials[2].

2. Technique: Artists cut out and paste paper fragments onto a surface, often combining them with drawing or painting elements[1][3].

3. Origins: The technique was pioneered by Cubist artists, particularly Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso, around 1912-1913[1][3].

4. Artistic approach: Papier collé is considered closer to drawing than painting in its execution and aesthetic[1][3].

5. Purpose: It was used to introduce elements of everyday life into artworks, often incorporating newspaper clippings, wallpaper, or other printed materials[3].

Notable examples and developments:

- Georges Braque's "Fruit Dish and Glass" (1912) is considered one of the first papier collé works[2].

- Picasso expanded on the technique, using newspaper pages instead of wood-grain paper and eventually developing it into three-dimensional assemblages[1][3].

- Other artists who embraced papier collé include Juan Gris, Henri Matisse, and Robert Motherwell[2].

Papier collé played a significant role in the development of modern art, challenging traditional notions of representation and introducing new possibilities for incorporating real-world elements into artistic compositions[4]. It remains an important technique in contemporary art practice, valued for its versatility and expressive potential.
