Based on the available information, Judi Dench holds the record for the most nominations in the Best Supporting Actress category at the British Academy Film Awards (BAFTAs) with 9 nominations[1][2]. However, the query specifically asks about the Best Supporting Actor category, for which the search results do not provide clear information.

The search results focus primarily on the Best Supporting Actress category and do not offer comprehensive data about the Best Supporting Actor nominations. Without specific information about the Best Supporting Actor category, I cannot definitively state which actor has received the most nominations in that category.

It's worth noting that the BAFTA Awards have separate categories for Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress. The information provided is more detailed for the Supporting Actress category, which may not be directly applicable to the Supporting Actor category.

If you're interested in the most nominated actors across all acting categories at the BAFTAs, Judi Dench and Meryl Streep share the record with 15 nominations each when considering all acting categories, including lead and supporting roles[1].

To get an accurate answer specifically for the Best Supporting Actor category, we would need additional information or data focused on that particular award.
