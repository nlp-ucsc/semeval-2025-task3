Lil Dagover was married twice in her lifetime:

1. Fritz Daghofer (1917-1919):
Lil Dagover's first marriage was to actor Fritz Daghofer in 1917[1][3]. Fritz was significantly older than Lil, with sources stating he was either 15 or 25 years her senior[2][5]. This marriage lasted only a few years, ending in divorce in 1919[1][3]. During their brief union, they had a daughter named Eva Maria Daghofer, born in 1919[3].

2. Georg Witt (1926-1973):
Dagover's second and longer-lasting marriage was to film producer Georg Witt. They married in 1926[1][5][7]. Georg Witt produced many of Dagover's future films[5][7]. This marriage lasted until Georg Witt's death, which occurred either on March 16, 1973[6] or April 17, 1972 (sources differ on the exact date)[3]. 

It's worth noting that Lil Dagover adopted a modified version of her first husband's surname, changing Daghofer to Dagover, which became her professional name throughout her long acting career[1].
