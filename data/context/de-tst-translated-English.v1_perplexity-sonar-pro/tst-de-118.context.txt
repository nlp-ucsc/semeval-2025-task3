The orbit is formed by seven bones:

1. Frontal bone
2. Sphenoid bone 
3. Ethmoid bone
4. Maxilla
5. Zygomatic bone
6. Lacrimal bone
7. Palatine bone[1][2][8]

These bones contribute to different parts of the orbit:

## Roof (Superior Wall)
- Frontal bone (orbital plate)
- Lesser wing of sphenoid bone[1][2]

## Floor (Inferior Wall)
- Maxilla (orbital surface)
- Zygomatic bone
- Palatine bone[1][2]

## Medial Wall
- Ethmoid bone (orbital plate)
- Lacrimal bone
- Frontal process of maxilla
- Lesser wing of sphenoid bone[1][2]

## Lateral Wall
- Zygomatic bone
- Greater wing of sphenoid bone[1][2]

The orbit has a pyramidal shape with the apex pointing posteriorly and the base anteriorly. The optic canal, located at the apex, is formed by the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone and transmits the optic nerve and ophthalmic artery[1][2].

Important features of the orbit include:

- Lacrimal fossa: Located in the roof, formed by the frontal bone
- Inferior orbital fissure: Separates the floor from the lateral wall
- Superior orbital fissure: Located between the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid bone
- Nasolacrimal canal: Found on the medial wall[1][2]

Understanding the bony anatomy of the orbit is crucial for clinical practice, especially in cases of orbital fractures, tumor resections, and other surgical procedures involving this region[3].
