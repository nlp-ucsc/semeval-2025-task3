The highest elevation in Lithuania, Aukštojas Hill, belongs to the Medininkai Highlands[1][4]. This hill is located approximately 24 kilometers (15 miles) southeast of Vilnius, the capital city of Lithuania[1].

Aukštojas Hill has an elevation of 293.84 meters (964.0 feet) above sea level, as measured in 2004 using GPS technology by specialists from the Institute of Geodesy at Vilnius Gediminas Technical University[1][4]. This measurement confirmed Aukštojas Hill as the highest point in Lithuania, surpassing the previously believed highest point, Juozapinė Hill, which stands at 292.7 meters (960 feet)[1][5].

The Medininkai Highlands, where Aukštojas Hill is situated, is part of the larger Baltic Highlands that extend into the eastern and southeastern portions of Lithuania[3]. This region is characterized by its glacial relief, featuring numerous small hills and lakes, which is a result of the last ice age[3][4].

It's worth noting that the area around Aukštojas Hill is quite distinctive within Lithuania's generally flat terrain. The glaciers that once covered the country left various sediments like boulders, gravel, sand, and pebbles at their edges, contributing to the formation of these hilly areas[4]. The glacier's actions also polished the surface of the Medininkai Highlands, creating a relatively flat and clear landscape with few deep gullies, allowing for uninterrupted views of the surrounding area[4].
