A kaimyō is a posthumous Buddhist name given to a person after their death in Japanese Buddhist tradition[1][2]. Here are the key details about kaimyō:

1. Purpose and meaning:
- It signifies that the deceased has become a disciple of Buddha and has entered the Buddhist path[3].
- The name is meant to prevent the return of the deceased if their original name is called[4].

2. Who receives it:
- Traditionally given to monks and nuns at ordination, replacing their secular name[1][2].
- In contemporary Japanese society, it's commonly given to lay people as well, even those who were not devout Buddhists in life[3].

3. How it's given:
- A Buddhist priest writes the kaimyō in kanji characters for the deceased[4][5].
- The family typically makes a donation to the temple in exchange for the name[4].

4. Composition:
- Usually composed of characters found in Buddhist sutras[4].
- The length and elaborateness of the name can vary based on factors like the person's virtues or the size of the family's donation[4].

5. Variations:
- Some Buddhist schools may use slightly different terms, like hōmyō (法名) in Jōdo Shinshū, though these are often used interchangeably with kaimyō[4].

6. Controversy:
- The practice of charging for kaimyō, especially high prices for more elaborate names, has been a subject of controversy in Japan[4].

In essence, a kaimyō is an important part of Japanese Buddhist funeral rites, serving as a new spiritual identity for the deceased as they enter the Buddhist afterlife.
