The Caucasian linden (Tilia x euchlora) belongs to the Malvaceae family[2][6][7]. 

This tree, also known as Crimean linden or Caucasian lime, is a hybrid species thought to be a cross between Tilia cordata and Tilia dasystyla[1][2]. It was previously classified under the Tiliaceae family, but genetic research has led to the incorporation of the Tilia genus into the broader Malvaceae family[7].

The Malvaceae family, also known as the mallow family, includes a diverse group of flowering plants. Tilia is notable for being the only known ectomycorrhizal genus within this family[7]. This means that Tilia species, including the Caucasian linden, form symbiotic relationships with certain fungi around their root systems, which is unusual for members of the Malvaceae.

The reclassification of Tilia into Malvaceae highlights the ongoing nature of plant taxonomy and how advances in genetic research can reshape our understanding of plant relationships and classifications.
