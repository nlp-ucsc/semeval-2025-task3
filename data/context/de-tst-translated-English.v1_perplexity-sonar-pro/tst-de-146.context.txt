The Ukrainian People's Republic (UPR) initially used the karbovanets as its currency when it was founded in 1917. Here are the key details:

1. First banknote: On December 22, 1917, the Central Council of Ukraine established the country's state bank. The first banknote issued by the independent Ukrainian state was the 100 karbovanets note, which went into circulation on January 5, 1918[3][4].

2. Value: One karbovanets was equivalent to 0.767 grams of gold[3].

3. Design: The 100 karbovanets banknote incorporated a trident in its design, referencing the gold and silver coins minted by Volodymyr the Great, which also featured a trident as a major symbol[3].

4. Transition to hryvnia: On March 1, 1918, the Central Council introduced a new currency called the hryvnia. It was valued at 1/2 of the previously issued karbovanets banknote and was subdivided into 100 shahs[3][4].

5. Return to karbovanets: In April 1918, when Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky came to power, he reintroduced the karbovanets as the main currency of Ukraine. This version of the karbovanets consisted of 200 shahs, and denominations of 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, and 1,000 karbovanets were issued[3][4].

It's worth noting that during the tumultuous period of 1917-1921, the Ukrainian People's Republic issued a total of 24 different types of paper money notes[6], reflecting the political instability and rapid changes of the time.
