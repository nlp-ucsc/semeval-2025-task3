I apologize, but I don't have specific information about the 5th Ice Hockey World Championship in the provided search results. The search results don't contain a comprehensive list of all past World Championships or details about the 5th tournament specifically.

To accurately answer this question, we would need additional historical data about the early years of the Ice Hockey World Championships. The search results mainly focus on more recent tournaments and future events, without providing details about the very early championships.

If you need this specific information, it would be best to consult official IIHF (International Ice Hockey Federation) historical records or specialized ice hockey history sources that cover the early years of the World Championships in detail.
