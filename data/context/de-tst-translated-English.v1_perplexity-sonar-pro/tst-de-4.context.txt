According to the search results, in 2020 there were approximately 1,600 pet supply retail establishments in Germany[1]. Specifically:

- As of 2022, around 1,600 establishments catered to pets and their owners in Germany[1].

- The number of sales outlets in German animal and pet supply retail had grown steadily over the previous decade, with a slight dip in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic[1].

- Two major enterprises dominated the German pet supplies market: Fressnapf and Futterhaus[1].

- Fressnapf, considered the leading pet supplies company in Europe, operated in 11 countries and had 870 sales outlets in Germany as of 2022[4].

- Futterhaus, another German company, had stores in Germany and Austria, with numbers steadily increasing in the years leading up to 2022[1].

It's worth noting that this count likely includes larger pet supply chains and specialty retailers, but may not encompass smaller independent pet shops or other outlets that sell pet supplies as part of a broader inventory. The pet supplies market in Germany also includes food retailers, drugstores, and discounters, which accounted for a significant share of pet food revenue in 2022[1].
