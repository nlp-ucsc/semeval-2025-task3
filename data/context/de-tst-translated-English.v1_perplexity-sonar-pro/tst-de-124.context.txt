In 1908, Pietro Nenni joined the Italian Republican Party (PRI)[3][6][7]. 

At the age of 17, Nenni began his political career by affiliating himself with the Italian Republican Party. This marked the start of his long and influential journey in Italian politics. As a member of the PRI, Nenni quickly distinguished himself through his radical attitude and activism[6][7].

In the same year he joined the party, Nenni also became the editor of a Republican newspaper in Forl√¨[1][3]. This position allowed him to articulate and spread Republican ideals, setting the stage for his future as a prominent political figure and skilled communicator.

It's worth noting that Nenni's political affiliations would evolve over time. While he started with the Republican Party in 1908, he would later join the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) in 1921[3], where he would go on to become a key leader and influential figure in Italian socialism for many decades.
