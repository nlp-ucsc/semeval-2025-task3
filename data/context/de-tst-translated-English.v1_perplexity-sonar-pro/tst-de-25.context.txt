The Second Council of Nicaea was convened in 787 CE[1][4][6]. Specifically, it opened on September 24, 787[1][4][8]. This ecumenical council took place in Nicaea (present-day Ä°znik, Turkey), the same city where the First Council of Nicaea had been held 462 years earlier in 325 CE[4].

The council was convoked by Byzantine Emperor Constantine VI and his mother Empress Irene, who was serving as regent[1]. It was presided over by Patriarch Tarasios of Constantinople, along with legates of Pope Adrian I[1][2]. The council was attended by between 258 and 335 bishops, with most sources citing around 350 participants[1][4].

This council is significant as it was the seventh and last ecumenical council recognized by both the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches[1][3]. Its primary purpose was to address the issue of iconoclasm and restore the veneration of icons in Christian worship, which had been suppressed in the Byzantine Empire during the reigns of previous emperors[1][2].
