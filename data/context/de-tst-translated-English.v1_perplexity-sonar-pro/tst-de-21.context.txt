Bert Olmstead coached the following clubs:

1. Vancouver Canucks (Western Hockey League)
   - 1965-66 season: Head coach[1][5]
   - 1966-67 season: Head coach[5]

2. California/Oakland Seals (NHL)
   - 1967-68 season: GM/Head Coach[1][2][5]

Olmstead's coaching career was relatively brief but spanned both minor and major leagues. He started in the Western Hockey League with the Vancouver Canucks for two seasons. In his first season (1965-66), the team finished with a record of 33 wins, 35 losses, and 4 ties, losing in the first round of the playoffs[5]. The following season (1966-67) saw improvement, with the team posting a 38-32-2 record and reaching the finals[5].

Olmstead then moved up to the NHL, taking on the dual role of General Manager and Head Coach for the California/Oakland Seals during their inaugural 1967-68 season as an expansion team[1][2]. However, his tenure with the Seals was short-lived. He coached 64 games, compiling a record of 11 wins, 37 losses, and 16 ties before resigning in March 1968[7].

It's worth noting that while some sources mention Olmstead potentially coaching the New York Rangers, this did not materialize. In 1965, there were discussions about him possibly taking over as the Rangers' coach, but this role never came to fruition[4].
