According to the 2010 census data, Gogebic County had a population density of approximately 14.9 inhabitants per square mile[5]. To convert this to inhabitants per square kilometer, we need to perform a unit conversion:

1 square mile = 2.59 square kilometers

14.9 inhabitants/square mile * (1 square mile / 2.59 square kilometers) = 5.75 inhabitants/square kilometer

Therefore, based on the 2010 census, Gogebic County had approximately 5.75 inhabitants per square kilometer.

This low population density reflects the rural nature of Gogebic County, which is located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The county has experienced a gradual population decline over the years, with the total population decreasing from 17,370 in 2000 to 16,427 in 2010[1][2]. This trend has continued, with estimates showing a further decrease to 14,224 by 2023[7].

The sparse population distribution is typical for many counties in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, which is characterized by vast forested areas and a relatively small number of urban centers. Gogebic County's largest city, Ironwood, had a population of 5,387 in 2010, with a higher population density of 839.1 inhabitants per square mile (or about 324 inhabitants per square kilometer) within the city limits[3].
