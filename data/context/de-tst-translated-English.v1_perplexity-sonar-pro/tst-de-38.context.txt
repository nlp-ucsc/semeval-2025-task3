I apologize, but I do not have enough accurate information to determine from which century the Church of Annonciation de la Vierge Marie in the French commune of Joannas dates. The search results provided do not contain any specific information about this particular church in Joannas, France. 

To properly answer this question, we would need to find reliable sources with historical information about the church in Joannas. This may require consulting local historical records, architectural surveys, or contacting the local authorities or diocese for accurate dating of the building.

Without access to such specific information, I cannot provide a definitive century for the church's construction. If you need this information, I would recommend:

1. Contacting the local municipality of Joannas directly
2. Reaching out to the diocese that oversees this church
3. Consulting French historical archives or architectural databases that may have records of churches in the Ard√®che department, where Joannas is located

I apologize that I cannot provide a more specific answer based on the available information. If you have any other questions about churches or historical sites that may be covered in the search results provided, I'd be happy to assist with those.
