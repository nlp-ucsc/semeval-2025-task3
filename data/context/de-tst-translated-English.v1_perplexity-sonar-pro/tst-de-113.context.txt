The tail length of small bamboo rats varies depending on the specific species, but generally ranges from about 6 to 20 cm (2.4 to 7.9 inches). Here are some details for different small bamboo rat species:

1. Lesser bamboo rat (Cannomys badius):
This species has one of the shortest tails among bamboo rats. Its tail measures around 6 to 8 cm (2.4 to 3.1 inches) in length[1][3]. The lesser bamboo rat's total body length is about 200 mm (8 inches), with the tail accounting for only about 60 mm (2.4 inches) of that length[1].

2. Rhizomys species:
The three species of Rhizomys, which are slightly larger than the lesser bamboo rat, have tails ranging from 5 to 20 cm (2 to 7.9 inches) in length[5]. These tails are typically short compared to the body and are either bald or sparsely haired.

3. Cannomys species (excluding C. badius):
Other Cannomys species have tails measuring about 6 to 8 cm (2.4 to 3.1 inches)[8].

It's worth noting that bamboo rats generally have relatively short tails compared to their body length. Their tails are often described as stub-like or rudimentary, and in most cases, they are sparsely haired or nearly hairless[5][8]. The short tail is an adaptation to their burrowing lifestyle, as it doesn't interfere with their movements in underground tunnels.
