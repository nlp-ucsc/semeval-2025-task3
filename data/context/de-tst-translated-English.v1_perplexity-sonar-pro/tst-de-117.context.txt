The name of the French commune Alvignac has interesting etymological origins:

Alvignac likely derives from ancient forms of the name that have evolved over time[3]. Some key points about its etymology:

1. Ancient forms: The earliest recorded forms of the name include "Rocamador" from 968 CE and "Rupis Amatoris" from 1186 CE[3].

2. Saint's name origin: According to linguist Albert Dauzat, the toponym Alvignac comes from the name of a saint, specifically Saint Amator[3]. 

3. Alternative theory: Gaston Bazalgues, another researcher, suggests the name originates from the medieval form "Rocamajor"[3]. In this theory:
   - "Roca" referred to a rock shelter
   - "major" indicated its importance
   
4. Christianization: Around 1166 CE, the name may have been Christianized to incorporate the hagiotoponym (saint's name) Saint Amadour or Saint Amateur[3].

5. Evolution: By 1473, historical records show the place was called "the castling of Saint Amadour"[3]. 

6. Modern form: The current name "Alvignac" emerged over time from these earlier forms, though the exact process of this linguistic evolution is not fully detailed in the available sources.

7. Local variant: The commune is sometimes locally referred to as "Alvignac-les-Eaux"[2], likely referencing its history as a spa town.

The name's evolution reflects the rich history of the region, incorporating elements of local geography, religious significance, and linguistic changes over the centuries. This blend of influences is typical for many French place names, especially in areas with long-standing habitation and cultural importance.
