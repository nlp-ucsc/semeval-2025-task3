Based on the available search results, there is no specific mention of a river flowing through Pferdingsleben in the district of Gotha. The search results provide limited information about Pferdingsleben itself, only mentioning that it is a municipality in the district of Gotha, Thuringia, Germany[1].

While the search results do not provide direct information about rivers in Pferdingsleben, they do mention some water-related features in the broader Gotha district:

1. The Leinakanal, a 25-kilometer long channel built in 1369 to bring fresh water from the Thuringian Forest (specifically from the Hörsel and Apfelstädt rivers) to the city of Gotha[2].

2. The Hörsel River, which flows through the municipality of Hörsel in the Gotha district[8].

3. The district of Gotha borders the Thuringian Basin, with its lowest point at about 200 meters (656 feet) in the northern part of the district[10].

However, it's important to note that none of these water bodies are specifically mentioned as flowing through Pferdingsleben. To get accurate information about rivers or streams in Pferdingsleben, more detailed local geographic data or maps of the specific municipality would be needed.
