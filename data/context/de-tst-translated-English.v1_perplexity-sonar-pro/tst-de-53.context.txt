The global orogeny phase during which the Alps were formed is called the Alpine orogeny or Alpide orogeny[1][2]. This orogenic phase began in the Late Mesozoic era and continues into the current Cenozoic era[1].

The Alpine orogeny is responsible for forming not just the Alps, but a whole series of mountain ranges collectively known as the Alpide belt. This belt stretches from western Europe all the way to Asia, including mountain ranges such as:

- The Atlas Mountains
- The Pyrenees
- The Alps
- The Carpathians
- The Caucasus
- The Hindu Kush
- The Himalayas

And many others[1][2].

The primary cause of the Alpine orogeny was the collision of the African, Arabian, and Indian plates with the Eurasian plate[1]. This process began around 65 million years ago, near the end of the Mesozoic era[3]. The collision led to the closure of the ancient Tethys Sea, which once separated these landmasses[4].

The mountain-building process involved enormous pressures that folded and uplifted sedimentary rocks deposited in the Tethys Sea, forming complex structures like nappes (large recumbent folds) and thrust faults[1][4]. In some areas, deeper crystalline basement rocks were also exposed, forming peaks like Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn[4].

It's important to note that while the major phase of mountain building occurred in the Paleocene to Eocene epochs, the Alpine orogeny is still ongoing in some regions[1]. The continued convergence of tectonic plates means that some Alpide mountain ranges, including the Alps themselves, are still experiencing uplift and deformation today[4].
