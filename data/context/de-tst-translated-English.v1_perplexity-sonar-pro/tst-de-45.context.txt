Gergely Kulcsár participated in javelin throw, an athletics event, in the Olympic Games[1][2]. He was a prominent Hungarian javelin thrower who competed in four Olympic Games between 1960 and 1972[1][2].

Kulcsár's Olympic achievements in javelin throw include:

1. Bronze medal at the 1960 Rome Olympics[1][2]
2. Silver medal at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics[1][2]
3. Bronze medal at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics[1][2]
4. 14th place in the qualifying round at the 1972 Munich Olympics[1]

Throughout his career, Kulcsár was a dominant force in Hungarian javelin throwing. He was a 12-time Hungarian champion in the event and was the first Hungarian javelin thrower to surpass the 80-meter mark[1]. His personal best throw was 87.06 meters, achieved in 1968[1].

Notably, Kulcsár served as the flag bearer for the Hungarian team at the Opening Ceremonies of three consecutive Olympic Games: 1964, 1968, and 1972[1][2]. This makes him one of the most frequent flag bearers in Olympic history.

After retiring from competitive athletics, Kulcsár had a successful coaching career. He coached the Hungarian national throwing team from 1975 to 1980, during which time one of his pupils, Miklós Németh, won the gold medal in javelin throw at the 1976 Montreal Olympics[1][2].
