The first Baptist congregation in Norway was founded by Fredrik L. Rymker, a Danish seaman and preacher. Here are the key details:

Fredrik L. Rymker (1819-1884) was originally from Denmark. He became a Christian through Baptist mission work while in the United States[2][5].

After returning to Denmark as a preacher, Rymker arrived in Norway in 1857 with financial support from American Baptists. He began evangelizing and spreading Baptist teachings in the Grenland region of Norway[2][5].

On Christmas Day 1858, Rymker conducted the first Baptist baptism in Norway, in the Porsgrunn river[2][5].

On April 22, 1860, Rymker founded the "Baptist congregation of Porsgrund and Solum" (now known as Skien Baptist congregation) with nine members. This was the first Baptist congregation established in Norway[2][5].

Rymker continued his missionary work, helping to establish additional Baptist congregations in Norway over the next few years, including in Larvik (1860) and Krager√∏ (1862)[8].

It's worth noting that while Rymker founded the first lasting Baptist congregation, he was not the very first Baptist in Norway. That distinction belongs to Enok Richard Haftorsen Svee, who became a Baptist in Denmark in 1838 and returned to Norway in 1842. However, Svee died in 1843 without establishing a congregation[8].

The establishment of Baptist congregations in Norway was made possible by the Dissenter Act of 1845, which for the first time allowed non-Lutheran Christian denominations to operate in the country[2][8].
