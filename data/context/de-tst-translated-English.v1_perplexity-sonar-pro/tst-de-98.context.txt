The length of Paris Métro Line 8 is 23.4 kilometers (km)[4][7]. This makes it one of the longest lines in the Paris metro network. 

Some key details about Line 8:

- It runs from Balard in the southwest to Pointe du Lac in the southeast of Paris[3][4].
- It has 38 stations along its route, tying with Line 7 for the most stations of any Paris metro line[1][4].
- The line follows a parabolic route through Paris, partly sharing its path with Line 9[2].
- It's the only Paris metro line to cross both the Seine river (underground between Concorde and Invalides) and its main tributary, the Marne river (above ground between Charenton - Écoles and Maisons-Alfort - École vétérinaire)[2].
- The complete journey from one end to the other takes about 52 minutes[2].

Line 8's length and number of stations make it an important artery in Paris's public transportation system, connecting many key areas of the city and its southeastern suburbs[1][3].
