Kayle Browning won 1 Olympic medal[1][4]. Specifically, she won a silver medal in trap shooting at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (held in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic)[1][4][6].

In the women's trap final at the Tokyo Olympics, Browning initially missed 3 of her first 4 shots but then hit 19 consecutive targets. She finished with a total of 42 hits, just behind Zuzana Rehak Stefecekova of Slovakia who set an Olympic record with 43 hits to win gold[6]. Browning's silver medal performance was impressive, especially considering she had to mount a comeback after a slow start in the final.

This silver medal represented the pinnacle of Browning's shooting career up to that point[6]. It was her first Olympic medal, coming after she served as an alternate for the 2012 U.S. Olympic team[1][3]. The medal also continued the United States' success in women's trap shooting, as it was the third Olympic medal for the U.S. in this event[6].
