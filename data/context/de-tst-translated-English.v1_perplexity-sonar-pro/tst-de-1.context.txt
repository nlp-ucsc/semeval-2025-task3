While the search results don't explicitly state that Sandberg produced all of these films, it's common for directors of short films to also serve as producers, especially when working on low-budget or independent projects. Sandberg is known for his work on short horror films, which he often made with minimal resources before his breakthrough into feature filmmaking[2][3].

It's worth noting that during this period, Sandberg was still an aspiring filmmaker working on small projects. His short film "Lights Out" from 2013 had gone viral, which eventually led to his feature film directorial debut with the full-length adaptation of "Lights Out" in 2016[2][3]. The short films he made in 2014 were likely part of his continued efforts to hone his craft and gain recognition in the film industry.
