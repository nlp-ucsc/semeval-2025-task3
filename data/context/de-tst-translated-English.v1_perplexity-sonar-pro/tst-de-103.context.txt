The Mogami River flows into the Sea of Japan at Sakata[1][3]. The Mogami River is one of Japan's three most rapid rivers and is 229 km (142 mi) long[1]. It originates in southern Yamagata Prefecture, flows northward, then turns west at Shinj≈ç before emptying into the Sea of Japan at Sakata[1][3].

Some key facts about the Mogami River:

- It has a watershed area of 7,040 km2 (2,720 sq mi)[1]
- Its average discharge is 392 m3/s (13,800 cu ft/s)[1]
- The river's source is Mount Azuma in Yonezawa, Yamagata Prefecture[1]
- Historically, it was an important transportation route for goods like safflowers and rice from inland areas to the coast[1]
- The river has cultural significance, appearing in Japanese poetry and literature[1]

Sakata developed as an important port town at the mouth of the Mogami River, which allowed it to become a center for ocean trade[3]. The river and port played a crucial role in the economic development of the region, facilitating the transport of goods between inland areas and coastal shipping routes[3][7].
