A retronym is a new term created for an existing thing to distinguish it from a more recent development or version[1][2]. It typically involves adding a modifier to an existing word to specify its original meaning, which has become ambiguous due to technological advancements or other changes[6].

Key aspects of retronyms include:

1. Origin and coinage: The term "retronym" was coined by Frank Mankiewicz in 1980 and popularized by William Safire in The New York Times Magazine[2].

2. Etymology: "Retronym" is composed of the combining forms "retro-" (from Latin, meaning "before") and "-nym" (from Greek, meaning "name")[2].

3. Purpose: Retronyms are used to avoid confusion between older and newer versions of similar things[2].

4. Common causes: Advances in technology and science often lead to the creation of retronyms[2].

Examples of retronyms:

- Acoustic guitar (to distinguish from electric guitar)
- Analog watch (to distinguish from digital watch)
- Landline phone (to distinguish from mobile/cell phone)
- Snail mail (to distinguish from email)
- Film camera (to distinguish from digital camera)

Retronyms are particularly interesting because they highlight how language evolves to accommodate new inventions and concepts. They often emerge organically as people need to differentiate between old and new versions of things[6]. The creation and adoption of retronyms reflect the dynamic nature of language and its ability to adapt to technological and societal changes.
