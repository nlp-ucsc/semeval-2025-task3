In 2011, Dawda Bah transferred to FC Augsburg in Germany[1][3][6]. Specifically:

- In August 2011, Bah signed a three-year contract with FC Augsburg, moving from HJK Helsinki to join the Bundesliga side[3][4].

- He made his debut for Augsburg as a substitute in a 4-1 loss to Bayer Leverkusen[4].

- Unfortunately, shortly after joining Augsburg, Bah suffered a severe knee injury in training that required surgery and sidelined him for about 6 months[6]. 

- The injury was described as "severe bone and soft tissue damage" to his left knee[6].

- Due to the injury, Bah only made one appearance for Augsburg in the 2011/2012 season[5].

So while his time at Augsburg was limited by injury, FC Augsburg was indeed the club Dawda Bah transferred to in 2011, marking a move from Finland's top division to the German Bundesliga.
