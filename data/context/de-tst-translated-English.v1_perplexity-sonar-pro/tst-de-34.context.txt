Excavations carried out in the caves of Cerdon since 1914 uncovered numerous prehistoric artifacts and remains, indicating that the site was inhabited from a very early period, approximately 10,000 to 12,000 years ago[4]. The discoveries included:

1. Multitudes of pottery fragments
2. Cut flint tools 
3. A huge heap of ash, measuring 4 to 5 meters thick
4. Large quantities of animal bones
5. A human skull with prominent orbits

These findings provide strong evidence that the natural shelter of the Cerdon caves was used as a refuge by prehistoric humans for an extended period[4]. The variety and quantity of artifacts suggest that the site was not just occasionally visited, but likely served as a long-term habitation area for early human groups.

The discovery of such a diverse array of artifacts, especially the human skull, is particularly significant as it offers valuable insights into the lives and activities of prehistoric people in the region. The presence of pottery, flint tools, and animal bones indicates that the inhabitants engaged in various activities such as tool-making, hunting, and food preparation within the cave system[4].

These excavations have played a crucial role in establishing the Grottes du Cerdon as an important archaeological site, contributing to our understanding of prehistoric human occupation in the area. The continuous occupation of the site since ancient times, as evidenced by these findings, underscores its strategic importance and favorable living conditions for early human populations[4].
