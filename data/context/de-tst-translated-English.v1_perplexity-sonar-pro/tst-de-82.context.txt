The Bolivarian Revolutionary Movement (MBR-200) led by Hugo Chávez attempted to overthrow President Carlos Andrés Pérez in a coup on February 4, 1992, but ultimately failed[1][2]. 

Key details about this coup attempt:

1. It was directed against President Carlos Andrés Pérez, who had implemented unpopular economic liberalization reforms[2].

2. The coup was planned and executed by the MBR-200, a movement founded by Hugo Chávez in 1982[3].

3. Five army units under Chávez's command moved into Caracas to seize key military and communications installations[2].

4. The coup plotters aimed to intercept and capture President Pérez, but were unsuccessful[2].

5. Fighting during the coup resulted in at least 143 deaths, with some estimates as high as several hundred[2].

6. Chávez surrendered and was allowed to appear on national television, where he famously stated that the objectives had not been achieved "por ahora" (for now)[2].

7. Despite its failure, the coup attempt brought Chávez into the national spotlight[2].

A second coup attempt occurred on November 27, 1992, while Chávez was in prison. This attempt was also unsuccessful but further solidified Chávez's reputation among his supporters[5][8].

Although the MBR-200 failed to overthrow the government in 1992, these events marked a significant turning point in Venezuelan politics and set the stage for Chávez's eventual rise to power through democratic elections in 1998[6][7].
