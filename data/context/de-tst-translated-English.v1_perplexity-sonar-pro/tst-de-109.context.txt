No athletes from Cape Verde have ever participated in the Winter Olympic Games[2][4]. Cape Verde has only sent athletes to the Summer Olympic Games, beginning with their debut in 1996[2][4]. The country has consistently participated in every Summer Olympics since then, but has never sent any representatives to the Winter Olympics[2][4].
