Gorgias of Leontini was born around 483 BCE[1][3][5]. While the exact year of his birth is not known with certainty, most sources provide this approximate date. 

Some key points about Gorgias' birth and early life:

- He was born in Leontini, a Greek colony in Sicily[1][3].

- His father's name was Charmantides[1][3].

- He had two siblings - a brother named Herodicus and a sister (unnamed)[3].

- The 483 BCE birth year is often cited because it's based on the only firmly recorded date in Gorgias' life - his visit to Athens in 427 BCE as part of a diplomatic mission when he was said to be approximately 60 years old[1].

- Some sources give a range of c. 485-483 BCE for his birth year[4][8].

It's worth noting that ancient biographical details can sometimes be uncertain, and scholars may provide slightly different estimates. However, 483 BCE or thereabouts is the most commonly accepted year for Gorgias' birth based on the available historical evidence.
