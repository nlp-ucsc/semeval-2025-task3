I apologize, but I do not have enough specific information to determine when the church in Rosendorf, Thuringia was built. The search results do not provide any details about the construction date of a church in Rosendorf.

The only relevant information I found is that there is a Protestant church in Rosendorf, Thuringia that is designated as a heritage monument[9]. However, this source does not mention when the church was constructed.

To find the exact construction date of the church in Rosendorf, more focused research would be needed, potentially including:

1. Consulting local historical records or archives in Thuringia
2. Reaching out to the local parish or diocese for information
3. Examining architectural studies of churches in the region
4. Investigating any plaques or inscriptions on the church building itself

Without access to such specific local sources, I cannot provide an accurate date for when this particular church was built. If you need this information, I would recommend contacting local historical societies or church authorities in Rosendorf or the surrounding area of Thuringia for more precise details about the church's history and construction.
