The Chengjiang Fossil Site, located in Yunnan Province, China, covers an area of 512 hectares (5.12 square kilometers)[3][10]. The site has the following dimensions:

- Length: 3,713 meters (oriented northeast to southwest)
- Width: 2,555 meters

The fossil site itself is centered around Maotianshan hill, which is located about 5 km east of the town of Chengjiang and 65 km south of Kunming City[3]. 

While the core protected area is 512 hectares, the Chengjiang fossils are known to occur more widely in the region:

1. The fossil-bearing sites extend approximately 100 kilometers from east to west and north to south around the Kunming area[5].

2. The main localities of the Chengjiang soft-bodied fossils are situated near Lake Dianchi and Lake Fuxian, which are the largest lakes in Yunnan Province[5].

3. The site is surrounded by a buffer zone that covers an additional 220 hectares, bringing the total protected area to 732 hectares[3].

It's worth noting that while the protected site itself is relatively small, the Chengjiang fossils represent a much larger ancient ecosystem. The fossils date back to the early Cambrian period, about 530 million years ago, when this area was a shallow tropical sea[3]. The exceptional preservation of these fossils provides crucial insights into the rapid diversification of life during the Cambrian explosion, making it a site of global scientific significance[3][5].
