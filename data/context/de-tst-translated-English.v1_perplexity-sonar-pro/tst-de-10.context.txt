James Braid was the primary architect responsible for designing Pennard Golf Club. Here are the key details about the course's design history:

- James Braid originally designed the 18-hole course at Pennard in 1908, shortly after the club was reconstituted that year[1][3].

- Braid made multiple visits to Pennard to work on the course design - in 1908, 1911, 1920, and 1931[1]. 

- While the overall routing has changed over time, much of Braid's original design remains today. He is credited with designing many of the key holes, including the 7th, 8th, 9th, 13th, 14th and 15th[1][6].

- Other architects have made contributions over the years:

  - C.K. Cotton made significant changes in 1965, particularly to holes 1, 2, 3, 6, 10 and 11[1][6].
  
  - Donald Steel made alterations in 1991, including work on the 4th and 5th holes[1][6].
  
  - Fred G. Hawtree made some changes in 1920[1].

- Interestingly, H.S. Colt was paid to make suggestions for alterations in 1920, though it's unclear if any of his ideas were implemented[1].

- More recently, Tom Doak has been involved in bunker renovation work at Pennard[2].

While several architects have left their mark on Pennard over the years, James Braid is considered the primary designer who shaped the core routing and character of this "links in the sky." His original vision from the early 20th century still forms the backbone of the course today.
