Quintilian was a professor of rhetoric in Rome. He became Rome's leading teacher of rhetoric and was appointed as the first public professor of rhetoric to receive a salary from the state treasury[2][5]. Specifically:

1. Around 68 AD, Quintilian began teaching rhetoric in Rome[5].

2. Under Emperor Vespasian (who ruled from 69-79 AD), Quintilian became the first teacher to receive a state salary for teaching Latin rhetoric[5].

3. He held his position as Rome's leading teacher of rhetoric under the emperors Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian, likely retiring around 88 AD[5].

4. For about 20 years, from approximately 68 to 88 AD, Quintilian taught rhetoric in Rome, combining this with work as an advocate in the law courts[5].

5. His expertise and prominence in teaching rhetoric led to him being considered Rome's foremost instructor in the subject during his time[2].

Quintilian's career as a professor of rhetoric culminated in his influential work "Institutio Oratoria" (Institutes of Oratory), a comprehensive 12-volume textbook on rhetorical education and practice that he wrote after retiring from teaching[1][4]. This work solidified his legacy as one of the most important figures in the history of rhetoric and Roman education.
