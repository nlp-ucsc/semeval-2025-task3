Kyle Korver was selected to the NBA All-Star team in the 2014-15 season[1][2][4][5][6]. This marked his first and only All-Star selection in his career. 

During that season, Korver was having an exceptional year with the Atlanta Hawks. He was leading the NBA in several key shooting categories:

1. Three-point field goal percentage (52.8%)
2. Three-point field goals made (160)
3. Free throw percentage (92.0%)[2]

Korver's selection came as a replacement for the injured Dwyane Wade of the Miami Heat[2]. His addition to the Eastern Conference All-Star squad was particularly notable because:

1. It made him the fourth Hawks player selected that year, joining teammates Al Horford, Paul Millsap, and Jeff Teague[2].
2. This marked the first time in Atlanta Hawks franchise history that they had four All-Stars in a single season[2].
3. At 33 years and 11 months old, Korver became the fourth-oldest first-time All-Star in NBA history[1].

The 2014-15 season was indeed a standout year for Korver. He averaged 12.1 points, 4.1 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game while shooting an impressive 49.2% from three-point range[5]. His exceptional shooting and overall contributions to the Hawks' success that season earned him this well-deserved recognition as an NBA All-Star.
