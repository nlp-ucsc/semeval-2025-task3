Bahram I was the son of Shapur I, who was one of the most prominent Sasanian kings. Bahram I assumed power over the Sasanian Empire in 271 CE and ruled until 274 CE[7][10].

Some key details about Bahram I's rise to power:

1. He was not initially considered the primary candidate for succession by his father Shapur I, despite being Shapur's oldest son[7].

2. During Shapur I's reign, Bahram served as the governor of Gilan, holding the title "Gelan Shah" (King of Gilan)[7].

3. Bahram I ascended to the throne in 271 CE after the death of his brother Hormizd I, who had a brief reign[7][10].

4. His rise to power was aided by the influential Zoroastrian priest Kartir[7].

5. Upon becoming king, Bahram I made an agreement with his younger brother Narseh, who gave up his claim to the throne in exchange for governing Armenia[7].

Bahram I's reign marked a shift in religious policy compared to his predecessors. While earlier Sasanian kings had generally practiced religious tolerance, Bahram I aligned more closely with the Zoroastrian clergy. This led to the persecution of religious minorities, including the imprisonment and execution of Mani, the founder of Manichaeism[7][10].
