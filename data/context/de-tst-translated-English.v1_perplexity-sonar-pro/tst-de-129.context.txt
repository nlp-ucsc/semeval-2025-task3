Sergei Parajanov's last film was "The Confession," which he began working on but was unable to complete due to his declining health and eventual death in 1990[6][9]. However, the film survives in a different form:

1. "The Confession" was left unfinished when Parajanov died of lung cancer on July 20, 1990, at the age of 66[6].

2. The surviving footage from "The Confession" was incorporated into a documentary called "Parajanov: The Last Spring," created by Parajanov's close friend Mikhail Vartanov in 1992[6][9].

3. "Parajanov: The Last Spring" includes the only surviving negative of "The Confession" and serves as both a portrait of Parajanov and a preservation of his final work[9].

4. The documentary shows Parajanov in 1990 working on "The Confession," as well as earlier footage from the 1960s when he was directing "The Color of Pomegranates"[7].

5. "Parajanov: The Last Spring" has been celebrated by renowned filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola, who praised it for exemplifying "the power of art over any limitations"[9].

It's worth noting that while "The Confession" was Parajanov's final project, his last completed feature film was "Ashik Kerib," released in 1988[6]. This film was based on a story by Mikhail Lermontov and was dedicated to Parajanov's friend Andrei Tarkovsky and "to all the children of the world"[6].
