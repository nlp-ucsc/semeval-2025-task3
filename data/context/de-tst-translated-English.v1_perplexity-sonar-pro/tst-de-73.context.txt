Liu Wenhui lived from 1895 to 1976[1][3]. He was a Chinese general and military leader who played a significant role in the politics and conflicts of Sichuan province during the early to mid-20th century.

Born in 1895, Liu Wenhui pursued a military career from an early age. He graduated from the prestigious Baoding Military Academy in 1916, which set the foundation for his future as a military leader[1]. After completing his education, Liu returned to his home province of Sichuan, where he would spend much of his career.

Liu's political and military career spanned several decades and saw him navigate the complex landscape of warlord-era China:

1. In 1926, he joined the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party)[1].
2. By 1929, he had risen through the ranks to become Commander of the National Revolutionary Army's 24th Army and was appointed governor of Sichuan Province[1].
3. His governorship of Sichuan was marked by instability and conflicts with other warlords in the region[1].
4. In 1934, he lost power to his nephew, Liu Xiang, and was subsequently made Governor of Xikang province[1].

During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Liu Wenhui adopted a cautious approach, minimizing his troops' involvement. When the Japanese launched their offensive into Sichuan, Liu retreated to Xichang in Xikang, refusing to surrender to the Japanese forces[1].

Liu Wenhui's life came to an end on June 24, 1976[3]. His career spanned a tumultuous period in Chinese history, from the fall of the Qing Dynasty through the Republican era, the Second Sino-Japanese War, and into the early years of the People's Republic of China.
