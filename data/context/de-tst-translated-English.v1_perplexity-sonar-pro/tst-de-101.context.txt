Oxford University Association Football Club (OUAFC) currently plays in the British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS) Football League[1][2]. This league system is specifically designed for university and college teams across the United Kingdom.

OUAFC fields multiple teams in the BUCS competitions:

1. The club has four men's teams and two women's teams competing in various BUCS leagues[2].

2. The highlight of their season is the annual Varsity match against Cambridge University, with the first teams (Blues) playing at a professional stadium[2].

It's worth noting that while Oxford University AFC has a rich history, including winning the FA Cup in 1874, they no longer compete in professional leagues[1]. Their focus is now on university-level competitions, providing opportunities for students to play competitive football while pursuing their studies.

In addition to the BUCS leagues, Oxford University also runs an extensive inter-college football program:

- This includes over 110 teams and 1500 players competing in weekly games[6].
- The inter-college system is divided into three leagues with promotion and relegation between divisions[6].
- Colleges also compete in annual tournaments such as Cuppers and the 'Hassan's Cup' plate competition[6].

This structure ensures that students of all skill levels have the opportunity to play football regularly during their time at Oxford University.
