The CSS-N-14, also known as the JL-2 (Julang-2), is a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) that is based on the land-based DF-31 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM)[1][6][8]. 

Specifically:

1. The JL-2 is considered a naval variant of the land-based DF-31 ICBM[8].

2. Development of the JL-2 and DF-31 began jointly around 1970, with both missiles sharing a common 2-meter diameter solid fuel rocket motor that was successfully tested in late 1983[8].

3. The JL-2 provides China with its first viable long-range, sea-based nuclear deterrent capability[6][8][10].

4. It is deployed on China's Type 094 (Jin-class) nuclear ballistic missile submarines, replacing the earlier JL-1 missiles that were used on the older Type 092 submarine[6][8].

5. The JL-2 has an estimated range of 7,000-8,000 km, though some sources suggest it could potentially reach over 9,000 km[1][6].

6. It can carry a single large nuclear warhead or multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs)[6].

7. The missile entered operational service around 2015, with China deploying 48 JL-2 launchers across four submarines as of 2019[6].

This connection between the land-based DF-31 and the sea-based JL-2 reflects China's strategy of developing both land and sea-based nuclear deterrent capabilities using related technologies.
