The exact number of genera in the family Oxycarenidae varies slightly according to different sources, but it generally ranges from 20 to 27 genera. Here's a detailed breakdown of the information from various sources:

1. According to Wikipedia, there are more than 20 genera in the family Oxycarenidae[2].

2. A more specific count is provided by a 2022 research article, which states that the family Oxycarenidae includes 27 genera worldwide[6].

3. An older source from 2009 mentions 22 genera known worldwide for this family[9].

4. The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) lists several genera under Oxycarenidae, including Anomaloptera, Auchenodes, and others, but doesn't provide a total count[4].

5. BugGuide.Net provides information specific to North America, stating that there are 6 genera in their area, with 2 of these being non-native (adventive)[1].

It's important to note that the number of recognized genera can change over time as new discoveries are made and taxonomic revisions occur. The most recent scientific literature (as of 2022) suggests that 27 is the current accepted number of genera in the family Oxycarenidae[6]. However, for the most up-to-date and accurate count, it would be best to consult the latest entomological research or taxonomic databases specializing in Hemiptera.
