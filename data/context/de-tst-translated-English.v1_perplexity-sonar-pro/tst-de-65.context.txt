The West Athens regional unit, which is part of the Attica region in Greece, consists of 7 municipalities[1][2]:

1. Agia Varvara
2. Agioi Anargyroi-Kamatero
3. Aigaleo
4. Chaidari
5. Ilion
6. Peristeri
7. Petroupoli

These municipalities make up the west-central part of the Athens agglomeration[1]. The regional unit of West Athens was created as part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, replacing a portion of the former Athens Prefecture[1].

It's important to note that this West Athens regional unit is distinct from other areas that may share similar names:

1. It is not the same as West Athens, California, which is a census-designated place in Los Angeles County[4].

2. It should not be confused with the broader concept of western suburbs of Athens, which might include additional areas beyond these specific municipalities[3].

The West Athens regional unit is an administrative division within the larger Athens metropolitan area, which helps organize local governance and services for residents in this part of the Greek capital.
