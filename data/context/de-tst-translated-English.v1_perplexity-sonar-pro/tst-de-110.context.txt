Maroilles cheese typically matures for a minimum of 5 weeks, but the aging process can extend up to 2-4 months depending on the desired flavor profile and texture[4][2]. Here are some key details about the maturation process of Maroilles:

1. Minimum aging period: The AOC (Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée) regulations require Maroilles to be aged for at least 35 days (5 weeks)[3][4].

2. Common aging durations:
   - 5 weeks to 2 months is typical for most Maroilles cheeses[4][5].
   - Some producers age their cheeses for 3-4 months to develop more complex flavors[2].

3. Aging process:
   - During maturation, the cheese is regularly turned and brushed with brine[4].
   - This process causes the rind to change color from yellow to orange and eventually to red[4].
   - The washing and turning eliminate natural white mold and promote the growth of bacteria that give Maroilles its distinctive red rind and flavor[4].

4. Variations based on size:
   - Traditional Maroilles (720g): Minimum 5 weeks of aging[7][9].
   - Sorbais (540-550g): Minimum 4 weeks of aging[7][9].
   - Mignon (350-360g): Minimum 3 weeks of aging[7][9].
   - Quart (180g): Minimum 2 weeks of aging[7][9].

5. Artisanal variations:
   - Some artisanal producers aim for longer aging periods, such as 60-65 days or even up to 70 days, to develop more body, flavor, and aroma[2].

6. Texture changes:
   - As the cheese ages, it becomes creamier, and the chalky center gradually disappears[2].
   - The rind color may fade from reddish-orange to a browner hue in well-aged specimens[2].

In summary, while Maroilles must be aged for at least 5 weeks according to AOC regulations, many producers opt for longer maturation periods of 2-4 months to develop more complex flavors and textures.
