Erwin Raphael McManus was born on August 28, 1958[1][3]. He was born in San Salvador, El Salvador, with the birth name Irving Rafael Mesa-Cardona[1][3]. McManus later adopted the name "McManus" from his stepfather and legally changed it in adulthood[1][3].

Some key details about his early life:

1. He was initially raised by his grandparents in El Salvador for the first few years of his life[1][3].

2. McManus immigrated to the United States at a young age with his brother Alex, joining their mother[1][3].

3. He grew up primarily in Miami, Florida, but also spent time in Queens, New York and Raleigh, North Carolina[1][3].
