Adolf Galland had three brothers:

1. Fritz Galland - The eldest brother[1][2][3][4]
2. Wilhelm-Ferdinand Galland - A younger brother[1][2][4]
3. Paul Galland - The youngest brother[1][2][4]

Adolf was the second oldest of the four Galland brothers[1][2]. All four brothers served in the Luftwaffe during World War II[1][4]. Their father, Adolf Galland Sr., had pet names for each of his sons:

- Fritz was called "Toby"
- Adolf was called "Keffer"  
- Wilhelm-Ferdinand was nicknamed "Wutz"
- Paul was called "Paulinchen" or occasionally "Paula"[1][2]

Three of the Galland brothers became fighter pilots and aces during the war:

- Adolf Galland was credited with 104 aerial victories and became a famous Luftwaffe general[4].
- Wilhelm-Ferdinand Galland achieved 55 aerial victories before being shot down and killed on August 17, 1943[2][4].
- Paul Galland claimed 17 aerial victories before being shot down and killed on October 31, 1942[1][2][4].

Fritz Galland, the eldest, also became a fighter pilot but had a less distinguished career. He initially served in the flak (anti-aircraft) arm before transitioning to fighters late in the war[3].
