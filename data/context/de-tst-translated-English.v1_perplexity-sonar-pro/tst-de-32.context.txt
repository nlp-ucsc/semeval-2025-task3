Sir Cornelius Vermuyden, a Dutch engineer born in 1595 on the Isle of Tholen in the Netherlands, was the key figure who initiated and led major drainage projects in the English Fens during the 17th century[7][8].

Vermuyden was first invited to England by King James I in 1620 to drain marshes in Essex[8]. His expertise in Dutch land reclamation methods soon led to larger projects:

1. In 1626, Vermuyden began his first major undertaking in England - draining Hatfield Chase in the Isle of Axholme, a project covering about 70,000 acres[10].

2. In the 1630s, Vermuyden became involved with draining the Great Level (also known as the Bedford Level) in the Fens. He wrote a "Discourse Touching the Draining of the Great Fennes" for King Charles I in 1637, proposing innovative solutions like washes and catchdrains[7][9].

3. Charles I appointed Vermuyden as his agent for draining the Great Level in 1639[7]. This project, covering approximately 400,000 acres across multiple counties, was Vermuyden's most significant work in England[10].

4. The drainage work in the Great Level continued into the 1650s, with Vermuyden directing major projects and implementing his proposed innovations[6][7].

Vermuyden's methods were groundbreaking but controversial. He introduced Dutch techniques such as straightening rivers, building embankments and sluices, and creating washes to store flood waters[4]. However, his work faced fierce opposition from local fenmen who saw their livelihoods threatened by the drainage projects[2][10].

Despite the challenges, Vermuyden's efforts fundamentally transformed the Fens, turning vast wetlands into productive agricultural land. His influence on English land reclamation was so significant that he is often credited as the primary engineer who initiated the large-scale drainage of the Fens in the 17th century[5][6].
