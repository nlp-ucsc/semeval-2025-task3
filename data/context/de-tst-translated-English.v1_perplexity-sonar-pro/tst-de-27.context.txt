The Spotted Blue-eye (Pseudomugil gertrudae) is a small freshwater fish species. Based on the search results, its size can be summarized as follows:

The Spotted Blue-eye is a relatively small fish, with most sources reporting a maximum adult size of 1.2 to 1.5 inches (3 to 3.8 cm)[1][3][4]. However, some sources indicate slightly different measurements:

1. One source reports they can grow up to 4 cm (approximately 1.6 inches)[2].

2. Another source states a maximum size of 3.5 cm (1.4 inches)[5].

3. The most precise measurement is provided by Seriously Fish, which reports a maximum standard length of 30 - 38 mm (approximately 1.18 - 1.5 inches)[10].

It's worth noting that females are typically smaller than males[3]. The average purchase size for these fish is often between 0.5 to 1 inch (1.2 to 2.5 cm)[1][4], indicating that they are usually sold as juveniles or young adults.

Given these various measurements, it's safe to say that the Spotted Blue-eye is a small fish species, rarely exceeding 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in length in aquarium conditions. This small size makes them an excellent choice for nano aquariums or planted tanks, where they can thrive in groups of 6 or more individuals[1][3].
