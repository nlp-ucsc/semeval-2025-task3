Chuseok, also known as Korean Thanksgiving, is celebrated on the 15th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar[1][2]. In 2024, Chuseok will fall on September 17, with the holiday period extending from September 16 to 18[3].

Some key points about the timing of Chuseok:

1. Annual occurrence: Chuseok is an annual holiday that typically falls in September or October according to the Gregorian calendar[1][3].

2. Three-day holiday: While the actual day of Chuseok is on the 15th day of the 8th lunar month, the holiday period in South Korea lasts for three days, including the day before and after Chuseok[5][6].

3. Lunar calendar basis: As Chuseok follows the lunar calendar, its date on the Gregorian calendar changes each year[3].

4. Full moon significance: Chuseok is celebrated on the night of the fullest and brightest moon, which is why it's also known as the Mid-Autumn Festival[1].

5. Future dates: The dates for upcoming Chuseok celebrations are:
   - 2024: September 16 – 18
   - 2025: October 5 – 7
   - 2026: September 24 – 26
   - 2027: September 14 – 16[2]

It's important to note that during this period, there is often significant travel within South Korea as people return to their ancestral hometowns to celebrate with family[1][5]. This can lead to heavy traffic and crowded transportation systems, which visitors to Korea should keep in mind when planning their trips around this time.
