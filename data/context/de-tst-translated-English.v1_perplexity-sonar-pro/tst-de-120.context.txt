The power output of the Aston Martin V12 Vanquish engine has evolved significantly over different generations and model years. Here are the key details:

For the latest 2025 Aston Martin Vanquish:
The new Vanquish features a 5.2-liter twin-turbo V12 engine producing an impressive 835 PS (824 bhp or 614 kW) and 1000 Nm (737 lb-ft) of torque[1][4]. This makes it the most powerful series production Aston Martin to date.

For previous generations:
1. The original Vanquish (2001-2005) had a 5.9-liter V12 engine producing 460 bhp (343 kW)[3].

2. The Vanquish S (a later variant) increased output to 520 bhp (388 kW)[8].

3. A more recent iteration (likely referring to the second-generation Vanquish produced from 2012) had a 5935cc V12 engine generating 565 bhp (421 kW) at 6750 rpm and 620 Nm of torque at 5500 rpm[2].

It's worth noting that Aston Martin has consistently increased the power output of the Vanquish over the years, with the latest 2025 model representing a significant leap in performance. The new Vanquish can accelerate from 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) in just 3.3 seconds and reach a top speed of 345 km/h (214 mph), making it the fastest series production model in Aston Martin's 111-year history[4].
