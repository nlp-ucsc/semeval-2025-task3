Air France Flight 296Q experienced the first crash of an Airbus A320[1][3][7]. This incident occurred on June 26, 1988, during a demonstration flight at an air show in Habsheim, France[1][7]. 

Key details about this crash:

1. It was a chartered flight operated by Air France using a new Airbus A320-111[7].

2. The flight was part of a promotional event, with most passengers being journalists and raffle competition winners[7].

3. The plane was supposed to perform a low-altitude flyover at 100 feet (30 meters), but instead descended to about 30 feet (9 meters)[1][7].

4. The aircraft crashed into trees at the end of the runway at Mulhouseâ€“Habsheim Airfield[1][7].

5. All 136 passengers initially survived the impact, but three people (two children and one adult) later died due to smoke inhalation from the subsequent fire[7].

6. This was not only the first crash but also the first fatal accident involving an Airbus A320[3][7].

The cause of the accident has been disputed. Official reports concluded that the pilots flew too low and too slow, failing to see the forest at the end of the runway[7]. However, the captain, Michel Asseline, claimed that an error in the fly-by-wire computer prevented him from applying thrust and pulling up[7]. The incident led to a controversial investigation and legal proceedings, with five individuals, including the captain and first officer, being found guilty of involuntary manslaughter[7].
