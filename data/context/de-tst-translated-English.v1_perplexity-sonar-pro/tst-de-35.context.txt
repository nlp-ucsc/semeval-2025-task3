The Church of Saint-Pierre in Soustons is built in the Romanesque style[7][8]. This church was constructed between 1863 and 1867, replacing an older Romanesque church that previously stood on the same site[7]. 

The new church was designed by diocesan architects Hippolyte Durand and Hippolyte Guichenn√©, with construction carried out by entrepreneur Dougier[7]. The sculptural elements of the church were executed by Auguste Fraysse, a sculptor from Bayonne[7].

Unlike its predecessor, which faced east, the current Church of Saint-Pierre faces west[7]. This orientation change is noteworthy, as traditionally, many Christian churches were oriented with the altar at the east end.

While the church was built in the 19th century, it deliberately employs the Romanesque style, which was popular in the region during the medieval period[8]. Romanesque architecture is characterized by thick walls, round arches, sturdy pillars, barrel vaults, large towers, and decorative arcading. This style was prevalent in Europe from approximately 1000 to 1200 AD, so the Church of Saint-Pierre in Soustons is an example of Romanesque Revival architecture, recreating these medieval design elements in the 19th century.

The interior of the church is described as beautiful, with striking stained glass windows that are particularly noteworthy[8]. These features, combined with its Romanesque styling, make the Church of Saint-Pierre a significant architectural landmark in Soustons and a site worth visiting for those interested in ecclesiastical architecture.
