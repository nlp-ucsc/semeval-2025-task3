Common murres primarily feed on small schooling fish, typically 200 mm (8 inches) or less in length. Their diet consists of a variety of fish species, including:

1. Polar cod
2. Capelin
3. Sand lances
4. Sprats
5. Sandeels
6. Atlantic cod
7. Atlantic herring
8. Northern anchovy
9. Pacific herring

In addition to fish, common murres also consume:

- Molluscs
- Marine worms
- Squid
- Crustaceans (such as amphipods)

The specific prey items in a murre's diet can vary depending on availability and location. For example, capelin and sand lances are often favorite food sources when abundant[1][2].

Common murres are pursuit-divers, using their wings to "fly" underwater and chase prey. They can dive to impressive depths, typically ranging from 30-60 meters (100-195 feet), with recorded depths of up to 180 meters (590 feet)[1]. This ability allows them to access food sources that many other seabirds cannot reach.

On average, an adult common murre consumes about 20-32 grams (11/16-1 1/8 ounces) of food per day, which is approximately 30% of their body weight[1][2]. They are single-prey loaders, meaning they carry one fish at a time, typically held lengthwise in their bill with the tail hanging out[1].

It's worth noting that while common murres have a diverse diet, the nutritional value of their prey can impact their health and breeding success. For instance, capelin is considered more nutritionally valuable than some other species, such as young-of-year Alaska pollock[2]. Additionally, in recent years, there has been an increase in the consumption of snake pipefish, which has poor nutritional value, potentially affecting the murres' diet quality[1].
