In French, inhabitants of a town or commune are often referred to by adding suffixes like "-ais", "-ois", or "-ien" to the name of the place. However, for very small communes like La Bellière, there may not be an officially recognized demonym.

In the absence of a specific term, the inhabitants of La Bellière would likely be referred to in French as:

- "les habitants de La Bellière" (the inhabitants of La Bellière)
- "les Bellièrois" or "les Bellièraises" (a potential demonym, though not officially confirmed)

It's worth noting that in such small communes, people are often simply referred to as residents of the larger administrative area, such as "Normands" for inhabitants of Normandy, where both versions of La Bellière are located.
