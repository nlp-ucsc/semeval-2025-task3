I apologize, but I don't have enough accurate information to provide the specific names of three strippers from the movie "The Gore Gore Girls". The search results don't contain a definitive list of character names for the strippers in this film. 

What I can tell you about "The Gore Gore Girls" based on the available information is:

1. It's a 1972 American exploitation horror film directed by Herschell Gordon Lewis[1][2].

2. The plot involves a series of murders of go-go dancers/strippers at strip clubs[1][2].

3. The main characters appear to be:
   - Abraham Gentry, a private detective played by Frank Kress
   - Nancy Weston, a reporter played by Amy Farrell
   - A strip club owner played by comedian Henny Youngman[1][2]

4. The film features graphic violence and gore effects, particularly focused on the murders of the strippers[2][4].

5. It's considered one of Lewis's more notorious "splatter" films, known for its over-the-top gore and dark humor[2][4].

While the film clearly features multiple strippers as victims, the search results don't provide their specific character names. To get accurate names of the strippers in the film, you would likely need to consult a more detailed cast list or watch the movie itself. I apologize I couldn't provide the exact names you were looking for.
