The Ritscher Upland, also known as Ritscherhochland in German, is a large ice-covered upland located in western Queen Maud Land, Antarctica[1]. This expansive plateau is situated in a specific geographical context:

1. Boundaries:
   - To the west and southwest, it is bounded by the Kraul Mountains and Heimefront Range[1].
   - To the east, it is bounded by the Borg Massif and Kirwan Escarpment[1].

2. Geographical coordinates:
   - The Ritscher Upland is centered approximately at 73°0′S 9°0′W[1].

3. Regional context:
   - It is part of the larger Princess Astrid Coast region in Antarctica[1].

The Ritscher Upland holds historical significance as it was discovered during the Third German Antarctic Expedition (1938–1939)[1]. This expedition was led by Captain Alfred Ritscher, after whom the upland was named[1]. The area was later remapped using air photos taken by the Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition (NBSAE) between 1949 and 1952, which was led by John Schjelderup Giæver[1].

It's worth noting that the Ritscher Upland is part of the broader landscape of Queen Maud Land, which includes other significant geographical features such as the Mühlig-Hofmann Mountains, the Wohlthat Mountains, and the Sør Rondane Mountains[2].
