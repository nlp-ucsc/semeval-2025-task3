The Bahamonde's beaked whales (also known as spade-toothed whales) that washed ashore at Opape Beach in New Zealand's North Island in December 2010 consisted of a mother and calf pair. The mother whale measured 5.3 meters (17.4 feet) in length, while the calf was 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) long[9].

These specimens were particularly significant because they represented the first complete bodies of spade-toothed whales (Mesoplodon traversii) ever seen by scientists[1][5]. Prior to this discovery, the species was known only from a few partial skulls and bone fragments collected over a 140-year period[1]. 

Initially, the whales were misidentified as the more common Gray's beaked whales. It was only after DNA analysis that their true identity as spade-toothed whales was revealed, making this discovery even more remarkable[1][6]. This finding provided researchers with an unprecedented opportunity to study one of the world's rarest and least understood whale species.

The spade-toothed whale is considered one of the rarest and least known large mammalian species in the modern world[4][6]. The Opape Beach stranding allowed scientists to describe the external appearance of this elusive species for the first time, significantly advancing our knowledge of these mysterious marine mammals.
