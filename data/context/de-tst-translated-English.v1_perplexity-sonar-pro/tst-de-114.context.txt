The Nimravidae lived from the Middle Eocene through the Late Miocene epochs, spanning approximately 33.2 million years[1]. Specifically:

1. First appearance: Nimravid fossils date back to the Middle Eocene, around 40.4 million years ago (Bartonian stage)[1].

2. Last appearance: The most recent nimravid fossils are from the Late Miocene, about 7.2 million years ago (Tortonian stage)[1].

3. Peak diversity: Nimravid diversity appears to have reached its highest point around 28 million years ago, during the Oligocene epoch[1].

Some key points about the Nimravidae's existence:

- They first appeared in North America and Asia during the middle of the Eocene epoch, when the global climate was warm and wet but trending cooler and drier[1].

- Nimravids flourished during the Oligocene, adapting well to the changing environment as forests transformed into scrub and open woodland[1].

- In the Miocene, as grasslands became more dominant, nimravids began to disappear along with woodlands. However, they survived in relictual humid forests in Europe until the late Miocene[1].

- The last nimravids went extinct about 9 million years ago when conditions in Europe ultimately changed in the late Miocene[1].

It's worth noting that one of the earliest known nimravids, recently identified as Pangurban egiae, dates back 37 to 40 million years, placing it among the earliest members of this family[2].
