Mar√≠a Grever composed her first piece of music, a Christmas carol, when she was just four years old[1][2][3]. This early composition demonstrated her remarkable musical talent from a very young age. 

Some key details about Grever's early musical development:

- Her father, Francisco de la Portilla, recognized Maria's musical gifts when she composed this Christmas carol at age four[6].

- The Christmas carol was dedicated to the infant Jesus[6].

- This early composition foreshadowed Grever's prolific career as a composer, during which she would go on to write over 1,000 songs[3][5].

- While this Christmas carol was her first musical composition at age four, Grever wrote her first published song "A Una Ola" (To a Wave) when she was 18 years old[1][3][5]. This song achieved significant commercial success, selling around three million copies.

Grever's early start in composition set the stage for her future as a pioneering female Mexican composer who achieved international acclaim. Her ability to create music from such a young age highlights the innate talent that would lead her to become one of the most famous composers of her time, despite facing challenges as a woman in the male-dominated music industry of the early 20th century.
