Magnar Solberg won two Olympic gold medals in the 20 km individual biathlon event[1][4]. He achieved this remarkable feat at two consecutive Winter Olympics:

1. At the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France, Solberg won his first gold medal in the 20 km individual biathlon[1][4].

2. He successfully defended his title four years later at the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Japan, winning his second gold medal in the same event[1][4].

This accomplishment made Magnar Solberg the first biathlete to defend an Olympic gold medal in the individual event[1]. His achievement is even more impressive considering that he remains the only biathlete to win the 20 km event twice, which was the original Olympic biathlon event[1].

In addition to his individual successes, Solberg also contributed to Norway's silver medal in the 4 Ã— 7.5 km relay at the 1968 Winter Olympics[4]. His consistent performance and ability to excel in the challenging combination of cross-country skiing and rifle shooting made him a standout figure in the history of Olympic biathlon.
