Hassan Rouhani won the 2013 Iranian presidential election, securing victory in the first round with over 50% of the vote[1][4]. Specifically:

- He narrowly avoided a runoff by securing just over 50% of all votes in the first round[1].
- The election was held on June 14, 2013[4].
- Rouhani was considered a moderate candidate on Iran's political spectrum[2].

The election results were as follows:

1. Hassan Rouhani (Moderation and Development Party): 52.49%
2. Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf: 17.14%
3. Saeed Jalili: 11.76%
4. Mohsen Rezaee: 10.95%
5. Ali Akbar Velayati: 6.40%
6. Mohammad Gharazi: 1.26%[1]

Some key points about the election:

- Voter turnout was high, with 72.71% of eligible voters participating[1][4].
- Out of 50,483,192 eligible voters, 36,704,156 votes were cast[1].
- Rouhani's victory was considered surprising by some analysts, as moderates and reformists had been largely marginalized in Iranian politics in the preceding years[2][6].
- The election took place in the shadow of the controversial 2009 election, which had led to widespread protests[5].

Rouhani's victory represented a shift towards a more moderate stance in Iranian politics, though the extent of potential changes remained to be seen at the time of his election[2][3].
