I apologize, but I don't have any specific information about when the Protestant church in Terény, Hungary was built. The search results provided do not contain any details about churches in Terény or their construction dates. To accurately answer this question, we would need additional sources focused on the local history of Terény or records from that specific church. 

While I can't provide the exact date you're looking for, I can offer some general context about the history of Protestantism in Hungary that may be relevant:

Protestantism began spreading in Hungary around 1520[4]. The Reformed (Calvinist) branch of Protestantism became particularly influential, with the first Hungarian Reformed synod held in Debrecen in 1567[7]. Many Protestant churches were established across Hungary in the 16th and 17th centuries as the Reformation gained followers.

However, the Counter-Reformation movement in the 17th and 18th centuries led to persecution of Protestants and restrictions on building new churches[1]. It wasn't until the 1781 Edict of Tolerance that Protestants regained more freedom to construct churches, though with some limitations[1].

Given this historical context, it's possible the Protestant church in Terény could have origins dating back to the 16th-17th centuries, or it may have been built after 1781 when restrictions were eased. However, without specific information about that particular church, I cannot make any definitive claims about its construction date.

To find the exact date, you may want to consult local historical records, contact the church directly if it still exists, or research Hungarian archives that may have information about church construction in that region. I apologize that I couldn't provide a more precise answer to your query.
