Abrus shrubs, including the well-known species Abrus precatorius, belong to the family Fabaceae[1][2][3]. This family is also commonly known as the pea family or legume family[4][5].

Some key points about the classification of Abrus:

1. Family: Fabaceae (also called Leguminosae)[1][2][3][8]

2. Subfamily: Faboideae[1][8]

3. Tribe: Abreae - Abrus is the only genus in this tribe[1]

4. Genus: Abrus[1][2]

The Fabaceae family is one of the largest plant families, containing many economically important species. It's characterized by:

- Typically having compound leaves
- Producing fruits that are legumes (pods)
- Many species having nitrogen-fixing bacteria in root nodules

Abrus precatorius, the most well-known species in the genus, is commonly called rosary pea, jequirity bean, or crab's eye[2]. While it has been used in traditional medicine and jewelry making, it's important to note that this plant is highly toxic and invasive in many areas[3][4][5]. The seeds contain abrin, one of the most potent plant toxins known[2].
