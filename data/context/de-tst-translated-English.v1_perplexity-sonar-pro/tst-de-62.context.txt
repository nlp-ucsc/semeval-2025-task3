Black Sabbath's 13th studio album was titled "Born Again" and was released in August 1983[1]. However, it's important to note that "Born Again" is not the album referred to as "13" in the search results.

The album titled "13" was actually Black Sabbath's 19th and final studio album[1][3]. It was released on June 10, 2013, in most parts of the world, with slight variations in release dates for different regions:

- June 7, 2013, in Australia[3]
- June 10, 2013, in the UK and most other countries[3]
- June 11, 2013, in North America[3]

"13" marked several significant milestones for Black Sabbath:

1. It was their first studio album in 18 years, following "Forbidden" (1995)[3].
2. It was the first studio album with original singer Ozzy Osbourne since "Never Say Die!" in 1978[1][3].
3. It was the first studio album with bassist Geezer Butler since "Cross Purposes" in 1994[3].

The album was produced by Rick Rubin and featured Brad Wilk of Rage Against the Machine on drums, as original drummer Bill Ward did not participate due to contractual disputes[2][3].

"13" was commercially successful, reaching No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart (their first UK No. 1 since "Paranoid" in 1970) and on the US Billboard 200 charts[3]. It received generally positive reviews from critics, though some controversy surrounded the production quality due to issues related to the "loudness war" in music production[3].
