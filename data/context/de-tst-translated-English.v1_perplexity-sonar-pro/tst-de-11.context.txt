Based on the information provided in the search results, there is no direct mention of which administrative regions border Tapin Regency to the north. However, I can provide some relevant information about Tapin Regency and its administrative structure:

Tapin Regency is one of the regencies in the Indonesian province of South Kalimantan[1]. It was created on July 14, 1965, by splitting off from the southern part of South Hulu Sungai Regency[1]. The regency covers an area of 2,174.95 kmÂ² and had a population of 197,893 as of mid-2023[1].

Tapin Regency is composed of twelve districts (kecamatan)[1]. Some of the northernmost districts in Tapin Regency include:

1. Tapin Utara (North Tapin)
2. Candi Laras Utara (North Candi Laras)
3. Piani

While the search results don't specify which regions border Tapin to the north, it's likely that the northern border of Tapin Regency is adjacent to other regencies within South Kalimantan province. To determine the exact bordering regions, more detailed geographic information about South Kalimantan's administrative divisions would be needed.

It's worth noting that South Kalimantan province is part of the larger Kalimantan region (Indonesian Borneo), which is divided into several provinces[6]. However, without more specific information about the local geography, I cannot definitively state which administrative regions border Tapin Regency to the north.
