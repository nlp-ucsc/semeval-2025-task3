Based on the search results provided, I cannot definitively state the fourth largest city in Dagestan. The information given does not provide a comprehensive ranking of Dagestan's cities by population size. However, I can provide some relevant information about the major cities in Dagestan:

Makhachkala is consistently mentioned as the capital and largest city of Dagestan[1][2][3][4]. It has a population of over 623,254 residents, with the urban agglomeration reaching about 1 million people[1].

Other major cities in Dagestan mentioned in the search results include:

1. Derbent
2. Kizlyar
3. Izberbash
4. Kaspiysk
5. Buynaksk
6. Khasavyurt

These cities are listed as significant urban centers in Dagestan[2][4][8], but their exact population rankings are not provided in the given information.

Without more specific population data for these cities, it's not possible to determine which one is the fourth largest. To accurately answer this question, we would need current population statistics for all major cities in Dagestan, which are not available in the provided search results.
