Federal Motorway 73 (Bundesautobahn 73 or A73) begins at the Suhl interchange (Autobahndreieck Suhl) where it connects with Autobahn 71 (A71)[2]. Specifically:

The A73 starts at a three-way interchange with the A71 near the city of Suhl in the German state of Thuringia[2]. From this starting point, it runs in a north-south direction, connecting Suhl to Nuremberg[2].

Some key details about the beginning of the A73:

1. It originates in a mountainous region of central Germany, in the Thuringian Forest area.

2. The first exit after the interchange is Suhl-Zentrum (Suhl-Center), providing access to the city of Suhl[2].

3. Shortly after its starting point, the motorway crosses several valleys via large bridges, including:
   - Haseltal Bridge (845 meters long)
   - Wiesental Bridge (252 meters long)
   - Langer Grund Bridge (372 meters long)[2]

4. The initial section of the A73 passes through a scenic, forested area as it descends from the highlands around Suhl towards the lowlands of Franconia.

This motorway serves as an important north-south connection in eastern Germany, linking Thuringia with northern Bavaria, and ultimately connecting to the major city of Nuremberg[2].
