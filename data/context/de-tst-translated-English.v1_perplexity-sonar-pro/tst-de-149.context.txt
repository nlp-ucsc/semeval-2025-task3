Bombykol is a sex pheromone used by female silkworm moths (Bombyx mori) to attract male mates[1][2]. It plays a crucial role in insect communication and mating behavior. Here are some key details about bombykol and its function:

1. Chemical structure and discovery:
Bombykol is a 16-carbon chain alcohol with the chemical formula C16H30O[1]. It was the first pheromone to be chemically characterized, discovered by Adolf Butenandt in 1959[1]. The molecule has two carbon-carbon double bonds, one cis and one trans, towards one end of the chain[2].

2. Production and release:
Female silkworm moths produce bombykol in their pheromone glands[1]. The biosynthesis of bombykol involves several steps, starting from acetyl-CoA and proceeding through palmitoyl-CoA[1]. When adult females emerge from their pupae, they release bombykol to attract male mates[1].

3. Detection by male moths:
Male silkworm moths have highly sensitive olfactory systems capable of detecting minute quantities of bombykol[2]. The pheromone is captured by pheromone-binding proteins (PBPs) in the male moth's antennae, which then transport it to specific receptors on nerve cells[5].

4. Specificity and sensitivity:
The male moth's response to bombykol is extremely specific and sensitive. In fact, one of the synthetic geometric isomers of bombykol was found to be at least a billion times more effective at exciting male moths compared to the other isomers[2].

5. Applications in pest control:
The discovery and understanding of bombykol have led to important applications in agriculture and pest management. Synthetic versions of bombykol and other pheromones can be used to:

   - Confuse male insects about the location of female partners
   - Lure insects into traps
   - Disrupt mating patterns

These methods allow for more environmentally friendly pest control, reducing the need for large-scale pesticide use[2].

6. Model for pheromone research:
Bombykol has served as a model compound for studying how pheromones work, including their biosynthesis, detection, and transport. Recent research has even used bombykol to investigate how pheromone molecules are transported in atmospheres containing aerosols[6].

In summary, bombykol is a crucial chemical signal used by female silkworm moths to attract mates. Its discovery and characterization have significantly advanced our understanding of insect communication and led to practical applications in pest management.
