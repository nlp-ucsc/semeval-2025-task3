Kaiser Chiefs were founded in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England[1][2][4]. The band originally formed in 1996 under the name Runston Parva, then reformed as Parva in 2000, before finally establishing themselves as Kaiser Chiefs in 2003[4].

The founding members of the band met while attending St. Mary's Catholic High School in Menston, West Yorkshire[4]. After leaving school, some members went to university while others remained in the Leeds area. When they reunited, they formed the band in Leeds[2].

Leeds has played a significant role in the band's identity and career:

1. Several members are ardent fans of Leeds United Football Club[2].
2. The band has performed notable hometown concerts, including a sold-out show at Leeds United's Elland Road stadium in 2008[6].
3. They've been described as "Leeds' favourite sons" alongside other alternative rock bands from the city[6].

The strong connection between Kaiser Chiefs and Leeds is evident in their fanbase, with many local supporters often seen wearing Leeds United shirts at their concerts[6]. This deep-rooted connection to their hometown has been an integral part of the band's identity throughout their career.
