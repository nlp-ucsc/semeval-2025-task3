Erik Gunnar Asplund taught architecture at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden[1][2][5]. He was appointed professor of architecture there in 1931[1][2][5]. His appointment was marked by a lecture titled "Our architectonic concept of space," which was later published and considered an important contribution to architectural theory of the time[1][5].

Some key points about Asplund's teaching position:

1. Institution: Royal Institute of Technology (also referred to as the Royal Art Institute in some sources)
2. Location: Stockholm, Sweden
3. Position: Professor of Architecture
4. Year appointed: 1931
5. Duration: He held this position from 1931 until his death in 1940[1][2]

This teaching role came later in Asplund's career, after he had already established himself as a prominent architect in Sweden. His appointment as professor allowed him to influence the next generation of Swedish architects while continuing his own architectural practice.
