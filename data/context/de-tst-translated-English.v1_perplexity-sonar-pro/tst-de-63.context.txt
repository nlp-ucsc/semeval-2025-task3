The Japanese era name that came directly before Genkyō was Gen'ō (元応)[4]. 

To provide more context:

Genkyō (元亨), also written as Genkō, was a Japanese era name (nengō) that began in February 1321 and ended in December 1324[5]. It was preceded by the Gen'ō era, which lasted from 1319 to 1321[4].

These era names occurred during the Kamakura period of Japanese history (1185-1333), which was characterized by the rule of the Kamakura shogunate and the rise of the samurai class[2]. More specifically, Genkyō and Gen'ō fell within the reign of Emperor Go-Daigo, who ruled from 1318 to 1339[3].

The practice of using era names, or nengō, began in Japan in 645 CE and continued until the Meiji Restoration in 1868, after which only one era name was used per emperor's reign[7]. These era names were often chosen based on auspicious concepts from Chinese classical texts and were used to mark time and significant events in Japanese history[1][3].
