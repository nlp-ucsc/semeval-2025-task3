Gianrico Carofiglio wrote the Italian novel "Il passato è una terra straniera" (translated into English as "The Past is a Foreign Country" and into Spanish as "El pasado es un país extranjero")[1][6]. 

This novel was published in 2004 by Rizzoli and won the prestigious Premio Bancarella award in 2005[1][4][6]. It tells the story of Giorgio, a 22-year-old model student from a bourgeois intellectual family, whose life changes dramatically when he meets the mysterious and fascinating Francesco[1][8]. Their friendship leads Giorgio into a world of rigged card games, misdeeds, and adventures, in what is described as both an intoxicating picaresque adventure and an unstoppable descent into hell[1][8].

Carofiglio is an Italian novelist and former anti-Mafia judge from Bari[6]. "Il passato è una terra straniera" was his second novel, following his debut "Involuntary Witness" in 2002[6]. The book has been translated into several languages and has received critical acclaim[1][4].

It's worth noting that while Carofiglio's novel uses this phrase as its title, the original quote "The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there" comes from the opening line of L.P. Hartley's 1953 novel "The Go-Between"[2][5][7]. Carofiglio's use of this phrase as his title is an homage to Hartley's famous line[4].
