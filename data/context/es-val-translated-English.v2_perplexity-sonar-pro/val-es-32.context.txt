The protests in Peru at the beginning of 2022 were significantly influenced by the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here's how the pandemic contributed to the unrest:

1. Economic downturn: The COVID-19 pandemic caused severe economic stagnation in Peru, reversing years of poverty reduction[3]. Between 10-20% of Peruvians fell below the poverty line in 2020, increasing the overall poverty rate to 30.1%[3]. This economic decline created a fertile ground for social unrest.

2. Shrinking middle class: The pandemic had a devastating effect on Peru's middle class, which shrank from 43.6% in 2019 to 24% in 2020[3]. This dramatic reduction in the middle class likely contributed to increased social tensions and dissatisfaction with the government.

3. Inflation and rising prices: Following the global economic disruptions caused by the pandemic and exacerbated by the sanctions against Russia due to its invasion of Ukraine, Peru experienced sharp inflation. By April 2022, inflation in Peru reached its highest level in 26 years, creating additional hardships for the recently impoverished population[3].

4. Healthcare crisis: Peru suffered one of the world's highest per capita death rates from COVID-19[4]. This severe impact on public health likely undermined confidence in the government's ability to manage crises effectively.

5. Education disruption: Schools in Peru remained closed from March 2020 due to the pandemic, with many students unable to attend remote classes. By September 2020, 230,000 students had dropped out of school, and 200,000 others were not attending classes despite being enrolled[6]. This disruption in education may have contributed to social frustration, particularly among younger Peruvians and their families.

6. Increased inequality: The pandemic exacerbated existing inequalities in Peru, with rural and indigenous communities often bearing the brunt of both the health and economic impacts[1][5]. This widening gap likely fueled resentment and contributed to the protests.

7. Political instability: The pandemic occurred against a backdrop of ongoing political turmoil in Peru, which may have been exacerbated by the government's handling of the crisis[2]. This instability culminated in the election of Pedro Castillo in 2021, whose subsequent removal triggered widespread protests[7].

In summary, the COVID-19 pandemic created a perfect storm of economic hardship, social disruption, and political instability in Peru. These factors, combined with pre-existing inequalities and grievances, set the stage for the protests that erupted in early 2022. The pandemic's long-lasting effects on poverty, inequality, and public trust in institutions continued to fuel social unrest well into 2023 and beyond[4][5].
