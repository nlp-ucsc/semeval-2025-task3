Lugdunum, the ancient Roman city, was located in what is now modern-day Lyon, France[1][2][5]. 

Founded in 43 BCE by Roman senator Lucius Munatius Plancus, Lugdunum served as the capital of the Roman province of Gallia Lugdunensis[1][2]. It was situated at the confluence of the Rhône and Saône rivers, a strategic location that contributed to its importance in the western Roman Empire[1][5].

Lugdunum grew to become one of the most significant cities in Roman Gaul. It functioned as:

1. The administrative center of Roman Gaul and Germany[1]
2. The site of an imperial mint, producing gold and silver coinage for the entire Roman Empire from 15 BCE to 64 CE[1]
3. The federal capital of the Tres Galliae (Lugdunensis, Aquitania, and Belgica)[3]
4. The headquarters for a major coin workshop that minted money for the whole empire[6]

The city's importance is further evidenced by the fact that two Roman emperors, Claudius and Caracalla, were born there[1]. At its peak between 69-192 CE, Lugdunum's population may have reached 50,000 to 100,000 inhabitants, possibly even up to 200,000[1].

Today, Lyon is the third-largest city in France, built upon the foundations of ancient Lugdunum[5]. The Roman history of the city is preserved in various archaeological sites and museums, including the Lugdunum Museum, which houses one of the finest archaeological collections in France[10].
