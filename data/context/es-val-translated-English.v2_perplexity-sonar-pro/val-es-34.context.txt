A main feature of a sustainable city is efficient and environmentally-friendly transportation systems. This includes:

1. Robust public transportation networks: Sustainable cities prioritize well-developed public transit systems like buses, trains, and subways that are accessible, affordable, and run on clean energy. This reduces reliance on private vehicles and decreases overall carbon emissions[1][3].

2. Infrastructure for active transportation: Sustainable cities have extensive networks of sidewalks, bike lanes, and pedestrian-friendly areas to encourage walking and cycling. This includes features like bike-sharing programs, dedicated bike bridges, and easily accessible bike racks throughout the city[3][10].

3. Electric vehicle support: To promote the transition away from fossil fuel-powered vehicles, sustainable cities install widespread electric vehicle charging stations and offer incentives for electric car ownership[3][6].

4. Smart traffic management: Many sustainable cities utilize intelligent technologies and data analytics to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and minimize idling times, further reducing emissions[4].

5. Car-free zones: Some sustainable cities implement car-free areas in city centers or during specific times to prioritize pedestrians and cyclists, improving air quality and creating more livable urban spaces.

These transportation features work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, decrease traffic congestion, and enhance overall quality of life for residents. By making sustainable transportation options convenient and accessible, cities can significantly reduce their environmental impact while promoting healthier, more connected communities[1][4].
