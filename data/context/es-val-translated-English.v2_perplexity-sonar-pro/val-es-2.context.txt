Gampel-Bratsch was created on January 1, 2009[1][2][3]. This municipality was formed through the merger of two previously independent municipalities:

1. Gampel
2. Bratsch

The decision to merge these two municipalities was made by the voters of Gampel and Bratsch on January 20, 2008[1]. This merger was part of a broader trend in Switzerland where smaller municipalities have been combining to form larger administrative units.

Gampel-Bratsch is located in the district of Leuk in the canton of Valais, Switzerland[1][2]. The newly formed municipality retained aspects of both original communities, including their rich histories and geographical features. For instance:

- Bratsch was first mentioned in historical records as early as 1228[1].
- Gampel's first historical mention dates back to 1238[1].

The merger has allowed for more efficient administration and potentially better services for the residents of both former municipalities. As of December 2020, the combined population of Gampel-Bratsch was 1,997[1], making it a relatively small but significant community in the Valais region.
