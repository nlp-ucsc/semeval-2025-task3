Chancelor Bennett adopted the stage name "Chance the Rapper" early in his career. He began rapping in the sixth grade and initially performed under the name "Chano"[5]. Later, he chose to go by "Chance," which is a shortened form of his first name[1].

In a 2017 interview with GQ magazine, Chance explained the reasoning behind keeping "The Rapper" in his stage name. He stated that he wanted to embrace and elevate the term "rapper," viewing it as synonymous with being Black. He aimed to challenge the stigma associated with introducing oneself as a rapper and wanted people to have positive associations with the word[7].
