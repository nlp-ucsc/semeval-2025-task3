White Collar has 6 seasons in total[1][2][4]. The series aired from October 23, 2009 to December 18, 2014 on the USA Network[2].

Here's a breakdown of the seasons:

1. Season 1: 14 episodes (2009-2010)
2. Season 2: 16 episodes (2010-2011)
3. Season 3: 16 episodes (2011-2012)
4. Season 4: 16 episodes (2012-2013)
5. Season 5: 13 episodes (2013-2014)
6. Season 6: 6 episodes (2014)[1]

The final season was shorter than the previous ones, with only 6 episodes to wrap up the story[1][6]. The series concluded after these 6 seasons due to USA Network's shift in programming strategy, moving towards riskier shows and away from popular series like White Collar[4].

In total, White Collar produced 81 episodes across its 6-season run[2][7]. The show starred Matt Bomer as Neal Caffrey, a charming con artist working with FBI agent Peter Burke, played by Tim DeKay[2][7].

While the series ended in 2014, there have been talks about a potential revival. As of June 2024, a reboot titled "White Collar Renaissance" was confirmed to be in the works, with series creator Jeff Eastin writing the script and involvement from original cast members Matt Bomer, Tim DeKay, and Tiffani Thiessen[2].
