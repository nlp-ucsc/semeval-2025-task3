The current Sakya Trizin is Gyana Vajra Rinpoche, officially known as Kyabgon Gongma Trizin Rinpoche, who serves as the 43rd Sakya Trizin[1]. He was enthroned on March 16, 2022, as the throne holder of the Sakya tradition of Tibetan Buddhism[3].

This appointment follows a new succession system announced in 2014, where members of both the Dolma Phodrang and Phuntsok Phodrang serve as Sakya Trizin in three-year terms, based on seniority and qualification[1]. Under this system:

1. Ratna Vajra Rinpoche was enthroned as the 42nd Sakya Trizin on March 9, 2017[1][2].
2. Gyana Vajra Rinpoche succeeded him as the 43rd Sakya Trizin in 2022[1][3].

Gyana Vajra Rinpoche currently resides at the Sakya Dolma Phodrang in Rajpur, India. He is actively involved in Dharma activities at the Sakya Centre and serves as its Vice-President, overseeing administrative responsibilities and ensuring the well-being of resident monks[3][9].

It's worth noting that the previous long-serving Sakya Trizin, Ngawang Kunga, who held the position for over 50 years, is now known as Kyabgon Gongma Trichen Rinpoche or the Sakya Trichen. He passed the throne to his elder son Ratna Vajra Rinpoche in 2017, initiating this new system of succession[4].
