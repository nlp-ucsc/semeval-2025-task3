The main ingredient of chocolate syrup is cocoa powder[1][2][3]. Cocoa powder is the key component that provides the rich chocolate flavor and color to the syrup. 

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the typical ingredients in homemade chocolate syrup:

1. Cocoa powder: This is the primary ingredient that gives chocolate syrup its distinctive chocolate taste and color. It's usually unsweetened 100% cocoa or cacao powder[1][2][7].

2. Sugar: Granulated sugar is commonly used to sweeten the syrup. Some recipes use brown sugar for a deeper flavor[3].

3. Water: This helps dissolve the cocoa powder and sugar, creating a liquid consistency[1][2][3].

4. Salt: A small amount is often added to enhance the chocolate flavor[1][2][7].

5. Vanilla extract: This is frequently included to round out the flavors[1][2][7].

For store-bought chocolate syrups like Hershey's, the ingredients can differ slightly. The main ingredients in commercial chocolate syrup often include:

1. High fructose corn syrup
2. Corn syrup
3. Water
4. Cocoa
5. Sugar[8]

It's worth noting that while cocoa is still a key ingredient in commercial syrups, it's often not the first ingredient listed. However, for homemade versions, cocoa powder is typically the star ingredient that provides the primary chocolate flavor.
