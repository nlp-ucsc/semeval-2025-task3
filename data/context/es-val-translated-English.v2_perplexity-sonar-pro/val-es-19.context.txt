Santiago de Compostela is the capital of the autonomous community of Galicia in northwestern Spain[1][2][3]. As the capital, it serves as the seat of the Galician autonomous government[1]. Santiago de Compostela is located in the province of A Coruña and has a population of around 95,671 inhabitants, with a metropolitan area of approximately 178,695[1].

Some key facts about Santiago de Compostela:

1. It is renowned as the final destination of the Way of St. James, a major Catholic pilgrimage route since the 9th century[3].

2. The city's Old Town was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985[1][3].

3. It is home to one of the oldest universities in Europe[1].

4. The economy of Santiago de Compostela is primarily based on public services, cultural and tourism industries, and higher education[1].

5. In recent years, the city has seen growth in new industries such as timber transformation, automotive, telecommunications, and electronics[1].

While Santiago de Compostela is the political capital, it's worth noting that Galicia has a decentralized urban structure. The region's urban network comprises seven main cities: the four provincial capitals (A Coruña, Pontevedra, Ourense, and Lugo), the political capital Santiago de Compostela, and the industrial cities of Vigo and Ferrol[8].
