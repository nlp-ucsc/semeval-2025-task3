Gustav Eriksson, who became King Gustav I of Sweden (also known as Gustav Vasa), initiated the Swedish Navy in 1522[1][2]. 

Gustav Vasa established the Swedish Navy during his revolt against Danish rule and the Kalmar Union. Recognizing the strategic importance of naval power for Sweden's independence and security, he took several key steps:

1. Acquisition of ships: In 1522, Gustav purchased and hired several ships from the Hanseatic town of LÃ¼beck to form the core of his naval force[1][2].

2. Establishing naval infrastructure: He set up a central maintenance and supply facility called Skepsholmen (Ship Island) in Stockholm, which served as an early naval yard[1].

3. Permanent naval force: After securing Sweden's independence and being crowned king, Gustav Vasa established the navy on a more permanent footing, recognizing its essential role in Swedish foreign policy[1].

The Swedish Navy considers 1522 as its founding year, and in 2022, it celebrated its 500th anniversary[1][2]. This makes the Swedish Navy one of the oldest continuously serving navies in the world.

It's worth noting that while Gustav Vasa laid the foundations, his grandson Gustavus Adolphus (Gustav II Adolf) significantly expanded and modernized the Swedish Navy about a century later. In 1618, Gustavus Adolphus consolidated shipbuilding operations and initiated a steady program of naval construction, further strengthening Sweden's maritime capabilities[1][3].
