The white-winged chough (Corcorax melanorhamphos) inhabits only the continent of Australia[1][2][3]. Specifically, this species is endemic to southern and eastern Australia[1][3]. Its distribution covers most of eastern and south-eastern mainland Australia, extending from southeast Queensland through New South Wales, Victoria, and into parts of South Australia[1][4][5]. However, the species is notably absent from northern Queensland[1][5].

The white-winged chough prefers open forest and woodland habitats, particularly areas with ample leaf litter for foraging and available mud for nest building[1][3]. These birds are well-adapted to a variety of Australian ecosystems, including:

- Subtropical/tropical dry forests
- Dry savannas
- Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation
- Areas near permanent rivers and streams
- Some artificial habitats like plantations and urban areas[2]

It's worth noting that the white-winged chough is an example of convergent evolution. While it resembles and is named after the European choughs, it is only distantly related to them[3][7]. The white-winged chough is actually one of only two surviving members of the Australian mud-nest builders family, Corcoracidae, and is the sole member of the genus Corcorax[3][7].
