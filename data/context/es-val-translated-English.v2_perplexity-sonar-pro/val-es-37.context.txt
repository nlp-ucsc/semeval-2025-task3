Nizhny Tagil is located in the Ural Mountains[1][7]. Specifically, the city is situated on the eastern slopes of the Ural ridge, about 25 kilometers (16 mi) east of the conventional boundary between Europe and Asia[1][3].

The Ural Mountains are a mountain range that runs north-south through Russia, forming part of the traditional boundary between the continents of Europe and Asia[7]. They extend approximately 2,500 km (1,600 mi) from the Kara Sea in the north to the Kazakh Steppe in the south[7].

Nizhny Tagil's location in the Urals has played a significant role in its development and economy:

1. Mineral resources: The city's proximity to rich iron ore deposits led to its establishment as a major center for iron and steel production[2][4].

2. Topography: The city is built around the now-extinct volcano Lis'ya Mountain, which has become a symbol of Nizhny Tagil[1].

3. Elevation: The altitude of Nizhny Tagil varies from 170 to 380 meters (560 to 1,250 ft) above sea level[1].

4. Rivers: The city stands at the confluence of the Vyya and Tagil rivers[3], with rivers and ponds occupying about one-third of the city's territory[1].

This location in the Ural Mountains has shaped Nizhny Tagil's history, economy, and landscape, making it an important industrial center in the Middle Urals region[9].
