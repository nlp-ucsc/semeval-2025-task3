I apologize, but I do not have enough accurate information to determine in which centuries Carl Löwenheim lived or if he was a Swedish count. The search results do not contain any specific information about a Swedish count named Carl Löwenheim.

However, the search results do mention a mathematician named Leopold Löwenheim:

Leopold Löwenheim was a mathematician who lived from 1878 to 1957[6]. He was born in the 19th century and died in the 20th century. Löwenheim made important contributions to mathematical logic, particularly in proving what became known as the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem[2]. 

It's possible you may have confused Leopold Löwenheim with a Swedish count, but I don't have any evidence to support that connection. If you're looking for information specifically about Swedish counts or nobility, the search results do contain some general information about the Swedish nobility system[1][5], but nothing mentioning a Count Löwenheim.
