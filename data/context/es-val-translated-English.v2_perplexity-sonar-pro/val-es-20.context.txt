The last Soviet space station was Mir. Here are the key details about Mir:

Mir was the third generation of Soviet space stations, following the earlier Salyut series. It was launched on February 20, 1986, while the Soviet Union was still in existence[6]. The name "Mir" means "peace" or "world" in Russian[6].

Key facts about Mir:

1. Modular design: Mir had a core module with additional modules added over time, creating a large, versatile space laboratory[6].

2. Long operational life: Although initially designed to last only 5 years, Mir remained in orbit for over 15 years, far exceeding its planned lifetime[9].

3. Transition from Soviet to Russian control: Mir was launched by the Soviet Union but continued to operate after the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. It then became part of the Russian space program[9].

4. International cooperation: Mir hosted cosmonauts from various countries and was involved in joint missions with NASA's Space Shuttle program in the 1990s[6].

5. Capabilities: The completed Mir complex consisted of 7 modules with 11.5 metric tons of scientific equipment[5].

6. End of mission: Mir was deorbited on March 23, 2001, marking the end of its long and eventful mission[9].

Mir's legacy is significant as it bridged the Soviet and post-Soviet eras in space exploration. It demonstrated the feasibility of long-duration human presence in space and paved the way for international cooperation in space, which would later be exemplified by the International Space Station.
