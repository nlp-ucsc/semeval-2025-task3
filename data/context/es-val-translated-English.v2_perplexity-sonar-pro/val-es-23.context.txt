FC Red Bull Salzburg, commonly known as Red Bull Salzburg, is the football team that plays at the Red Bull Arena in Salzburg, Austria[1][3]. The club competes in the Austrian Bundesliga, which is the top flight of Austrian football[1].

Founded in 1933, the club was originally known as SV Austria Salzburg. In 2005, it was acquired by Red Bull GmbH, who renamed the club and changed its colors from violet and white to red and white[1]. This change led to some fans forming a new club, SV Austria Salzburg, to preserve the original team's legacy[1].

The Red Bull Arena, which serves as the home ground for FC Red Bull Salzburg, was officially opened in March 2003[2][3]. It has a current seating capacity of 30,188 for domestic matches, though this is reduced to 29,520 for European competitions due to UEFA regulations[2][5]. The stadium was expanded from its original capacity of 18,200 to over 30,000 to accommodate the 2008 European Football Championships[3].

FC Red Bull Salzburg has been highly successful in domestic competitions, winning multiple Austrian Bundesliga titles and Austrian Cups[1]. The club has also made significant strides in European competitions, reaching the semi-finals of the UEFA Europa League in the 2017-18 season[1].

It's worth noting that due to sponsorship restrictions in UEFA competitions, the club is officially referred to as FC Salzburg and uses a modified crest when participating in FIFA and UEFA tournaments[1].
