The Main River passes near Bischofsheim, Hesse in Germany. Bischofsheim is located in the Gro√ü-Gerau district of Hesse, situated south of the Main and east of the Rhine in an area known as the Mainspitze triangle[3]. This triangle is formed by the confluence of the Main and Rhine rivers.

Specifically:

1. Bischofsheim lies in a narrow piece of land between the Main and Rhine rivers, where the Main empties into the Rhine[3].

2. The Main River is an important right-bank tributary of the Rhine in Germany. It flows for 326 miles (524 km) through several German states, including Hesse[4].

3. The Main River plays a significant role in the region's geography and transportation:

   - It's part of the Main-Danube Canal, creating a 2,200-mile (3,500-km) waterway from the North Sea to the Black Sea[4].
   - The river has been canalized upstream to Bamberg, making it an important waterway for commercial transportation[4].

4. Bischofsheim's location near these two important rivers (Main and Rhine) provides access to waterborne transportation[3].

5. The nearby Mainz-Bischofsheim station serves as the center of a railway hub, further emphasizing the area's strategic location in relation to the rivers[3].

While the Rhine is also close to Bischofsheim, the Main River is the one that passes more directly near the town before joining the Rhine. This confluence of major rivers makes Bischofsheim's location significant for both transportation and geography in the region.
