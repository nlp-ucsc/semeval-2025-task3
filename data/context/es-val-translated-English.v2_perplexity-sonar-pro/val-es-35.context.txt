Zhejiang Province, located south of Shanghai, is famous for its distinctive cuisine[1][7]. Zhejiang cuisine, also known as Zhe cuisine, is one of the Eight Great Traditions of Chinese cuisine and is renowned for its fresh, soft flavors with a mellow fragrance[6][7].

Some key characteristics of Zhejiang cuisine include:

1. Freshness: The cuisine emphasizes using fresh, seasonal ingredients[7].

2. Cooking techniques: It employs various cooking methods such as quick-frying, stir-frying, braising, and steaming to preserve the natural flavors of ingredients[7].

3. Mildness: Unlike spicier cuisines from other regions, Zhejiang dishes are generally not greasy and have a more subtle taste[7].

4. Regional styles: Zhejiang cuisine comprises at least three distinct styles, each originating from a major city in the province[7]:
   - Hangzhou style: Known for its rich variations and use of bamboo shoots
   - Shaoxing style: Specializes in poultry and freshwater fish
   - Ningbo style: Focuses on seafood dishes with an emphasis on freshness and salty flavors

5. Signature dishes: Some famous dishes from Zhejiang include Dongpo pork, West Lake fish in vinegar gravy, and Longjing shrimp[1][7].

Zhejiang's culinary influence extends to neighboring areas, including Shanghai. In fact, Shanghai cuisine is often considered a part of the broader Jiangnan culinary tradition, which encompasses cuisines from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai[5][9]. This regional cuisine is known for its emphasis on preserving the original flavors of ingredients, use of light seasonings, and incorporation of local produce and seafood[3][5].
