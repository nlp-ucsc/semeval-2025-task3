The lyrics of Portugal's national anthem, "A Portuguesa," were written by Henrique Lopes de Mendonça in 1890[1][3][5]. Mendonça was a Portuguese poet, playwright, novelist, and naval officer[6]. He collaborated with his friend, composer Alfredo Keil, who wrote the music for the anthem[3][5].

Henrique Lopes de Mendonça was born on July 3, 1856, and passed away on August 24, 1931[6]. He wrote the lyrics in response to the 1890 British Ultimatum, which demanded that Portugal withdraw its forces from certain areas in Africa[1][3]. This event sparked a resurgent nationalist movement in Portugal, inspiring Mendonça to pen the patriotic words of "A Portuguesa"[5].

The anthem was initially used as a marching song for a failed republican revolt in Porto on January 31, 1891[5]. Despite being banned for a time due to its association with republican ideals, "A Portuguesa" gained popularity and was officially adopted as the national anthem of Portugal on October 5, 1910, following the establishment of the Portuguese Republic[1][5]. It replaced the previous anthem "Hino da Carta," which had been associated with the deposed constitutional monarchy[5].

Mendonça's lyrics for "A Portuguesa" are notably patriotic and call for national unity and resistance against foreign threats. The anthem's chorus, which translates to "To arms, to arms! Over land, over sea, To arms, to arms! For the Fatherland, fight! Against the cannons, march on, march on!" reflects the defiant spirit that characterized Portugal's response to the British Ultimatum[3].
