Okay, so the user asked about the rotation speed of Beta Camelopardalis, also known as Beta Giraffe. I don't have the specific information on its rotational velocity. But I can think about how to approach this.

First, Beta Camelopardalis is a star, so its rotation speed is usually measured in kilometers per second. I remember that stars rotate at various speeds, some much faster than others. For example, our Sun has a rotation period of about 25-35 days at the equator, which translates to a surface speed of roughly 2 km/s. But some stars rotate much faster, like some hot, massive stars that can reach up to several hundred km/s.

I don't have the exact value for Beta Camelopardalis, but maybe I can find some context. It's a subgiant star, a bit more massive than the Sun. More massive stars tend to rotate faster, but it also depends on their evolutionary stage. Subgiants are transitioning from main sequence to giants, so their rotation might slow down due to expansion, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, the user might have heard that Beta Giraffe has a high rotation speed, but without the exact figure. I should probably mention that if they want precise data, they might need to consult a specific astronomical database or recent research papers. I can also suggest some resources where they can look it up, like the SIMBAD database or NASA's ADS.

I should make sure my response is clear and helpful, even if I can't provide the exact number they're looking for.
