Hugh Fraser is best known for his portrayal of Captain Arthur Hastings in the television series "Agatha Christie's Poirot"[1][2]. Captain Hastings is Hercule Poirot's loyal friend and sidekick, appearing alongside David Suchet's Poirot in many episodes of the long-running series[4].

Fraser played Captain Hastings in seasons one to eight of the show, and then returned for the final season (season 13)[2][3]. In total, he appeared in 43 episodes of "Agatha Christie's Poirot" between 1989 and 2013[10].

Captain Hastings is characterized as Poirot's trusting companion and amateur detective assistant[2]. While not as sharp as Poirot himself, Hastings is portrayed as a well-meaning English gentleman who often helps Poirot in his investigations[7]. Fraser's interpretation of the character expanded on Christie's original creation, giving Hastings more depth and a richer personality for the television adaptation[6].

Fraser's portrayal of Hastings became an integral part of the show's "basic family unit" around Poirot, providing someone for the detective to confide in and explain his deductions to[6]. This helped make the character more prominent in the TV series than he was in Christie's original stories[6].
