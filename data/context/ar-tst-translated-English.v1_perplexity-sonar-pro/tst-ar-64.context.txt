I apologize, but I could not find any specific information in the given search results about complaints from newspapers against a "silent telescope." The search results do not contain any relevant information about newspapers complaining about telescopes.

The search results primarily discuss different types of telescopes, radio telescopes, and some controversies surrounding the construction of large telescopes, but there is no mention of newspapers or complaints about a "silent telescope."

If you have additional context or information about this topic, please provide it, and I'll be happy to help further. Alternatively, you may want to rephrase your question or provide more details to get a more accurate answer.
