Richard B. Spencer does not formally belong to any established political party. He is primarily known as an independent far-right political activist and white nationalist[3][4]. Some key points about Spencer's political affiliations and views:

1. Alt-right founder: Spencer claims to have coined the term "alt-right" and has been a prominent figure in the alt-right movement, which promotes white nationalism and rejects mainstream conservatism[3][4].

2. White nationalist ideology: He advocates for a white ethno-state and has expressed neo-Nazi and antisemitic views[3].

3. Changing political support: 
   - In 2016, Spencer was a vocal supporter of Donald Trump's presidential campaign[2][3].
   - By 2018, he had distanced himself from Trump, saying "the Trump moment is over"[3].
   - In 2020, Spencer endorsed Joe Biden and the Democratic ticket for the presidential election, though the Biden campaign renounced his support[3].
   - For the 2024 election, Spencer has expressed support for Kamala Harris[1][3].

4. Past libertarian involvement: In the late 2000s, Spencer was involved in the libertarian movement and supported Ron Paul. However, he later disavowed libertarianism as incompatible with white nationalism[3].

5. Geopolitical views: Spencer has advocated for the US to pull out of NATO and has expressed admiration for Russia[3].

It's important to note that Spencer's political stances have shifted over time, and he has often contradicted his own previous statements. In recent years, he has even claimed to no longer identify as a white nationalist, though this claim is viewed skeptically given his long history of promoting white nationalist ideas[3].
