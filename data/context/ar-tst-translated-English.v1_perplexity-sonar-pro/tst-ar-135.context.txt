The BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role is presented annually by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA)[1]. This prestigious award recognizes outstanding performances by supporting actors in films released during the eligible year.

The voting process for this award, like other BAFTA Film Awards, involves BAFTA's Film members, who are industry professionals from various sectors of the film industry[2]. Here's a breakdown of the voting process:

1. Eligibility and Initial Voting:
   - There are approximately 8,100 BAFTA Film members eligible to vote.
   - Members must view eligible films on the BAFTA View platform to participate in voting.
   - Voters are assigned to randomized viewing groups, each containing 15 films they must watch, though many view more.

2. Longlist Creation:
   - The first round of voting results in a longlist, typically announced in early January.
   - Members vote in categories they are eligible for, either as part of specialized Chapters or diverse Juries.

3. Nomination Selection:
   - After the longlist is revealed, voting recommences for a week.
   - Chapters and Juries vote again in their eligible categories.
   - Voters must watch all longlisted films in a category to vote in that category.

4. Final Voting:
   - In the final round, all BAFTA Film members can vote in nearly all categories, including Best Supporting Actor.
   - Voting typically occurs over about three weeks in January and early February.

5. Winner Selection:
   - The winner is determined by this final round of voting from the entire BAFTA Film membership.

The award is presented at the annual BAFTA Film Awards ceremony, usually held in February[1]. This event is one of the most prestigious in the British film calendar and is often seen as a precursor to the Academy Awards.

It's worth noting that BAFTA has implemented measures to ensure fairness and diversity in the voting process. These include the requirement for members to watch a minimum number of films and the ability to track viewing activity on the BAFTA View platform[2].
