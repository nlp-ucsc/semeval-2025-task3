I apologize, but I don't have enough information from the provided search results to determine the exact date when the city of Sakata was officially founded. The search results contain various details about Sakata's history and attractions, but they do not specify the city's official founding date.

However, I can provide some relevant historical context about Sakata based on the available information:

1. Sakata has a long history as an important port city, particularly during the Edo Period (1603-1868). It grew as a significant stop along the coastal shipping route connecting Hokkaido with Osaka[1].

2. During the Edo Period, Sakata flourished as a merchant city due to its strategic location at the mouth of the Mogami River and on the Sea of Japan coast. It became a terminal for sea and river-bound trade, with rice from the Shonai Plain being a major commodity[2].

3. By the late 1600s, Sakata was servicing major cities in Japan, including the new capital of Edo (modern-day Tokyo), through its port and the Kitamaebune ships[3].

4. In 1893, the Sankyo Storehouse was built to store Shonai rice, indicating that Sakata was already a well-established city by that time[5].

While these points highlight Sakata's long-standing importance as a port and trading city, they don't provide the specific date of its official founding as a modern city. To get the exact founding date, you would need to consult official records from the Japanese government or Sakata's city archives, which are not included in the given search results.
