An oval and an ellipse are both closed, curved shapes, but they have some key differences:

1. Definition:
   - An oval is a general term for any egg-like shape with a smooth, closed curve[1][4]. It's not precisely defined mathematically.
   - An ellipse is a specific geometric shape with a precise mathematical definition[2][5]. It's the set of points where the sum of distances from two fixed points (foci) is constant[5].

2. Symmetry:
   - Ovals may have only one axis of symmetry, or sometimes none at all[6].
   - Ellipses always have two axes of symmetry - the major and minor axes[2][5].

3. Shape:
   - Ovals can be uneven, with one end wider than the other, like an egg shape[1][4].
   - Ellipses are always symmetrical, resembling a stretched or squashed circle[1][2].

4. Mathematical properties:
   - Ovals don't have specific mathematical properties or focal points[1].
   - Ellipses have two focal points and follow precise mathematical rules[2][5].

5. Construction:
   - Ovals can be constructed using arcs of different radii[6].
   - Ellipses are formed by intersecting a cone with a plane at an angle[2][10].

6. Uniformity:
   - Ovals can vary in their proportions and don't necessarily have a uniform curvature[7].
   - Ellipses have a consistent, mathematically defined curvature[2][10].

7. Usage:
   - "Oval" is often used informally to describe any egg-like shape[4][7].
   - "Ellipse" is used in formal mathematical and scientific contexts[2][10].

In summary, while all ellipses are ovals, not all ovals are ellipses[3]. An ellipse is a specific type of oval with precise mathematical properties, while an oval is a more general term for any egg-like shape.
