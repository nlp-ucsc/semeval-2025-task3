On her self-titled album "Britney" released in 2001, Britney Spears co-wrote 5 songs:

1. "Lonely"
2. "Anticipating" 
3. "Cinderella"
4. "Let Me Be"
5. "That's Where You Take Me"

This marked an expansion of Spears' songwriting involvement compared to her previous albums. On "Britney", she received lead writing credits for all of these tracks except "Cinderella"[2][4]. 

This increased songwriting participation reflected Spears' desire to have more creative input on her music as she matured as an artist. In interviews at the time, she expressed that writing for this album made the project "that much more special" to her, and that she wanted to "get better and grow" as a songwriter[4].

The album "Britney" represented a transitional period in Spears' career where she was taking more control over her artistic direction and image. Her co-writing these tracks was part of her evolution from a teen pop star to a more adult artist with greater involvement in her musical output.
