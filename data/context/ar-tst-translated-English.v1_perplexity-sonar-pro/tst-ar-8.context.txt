The French-speaking minority in Vilvoorde is represented by 3 members on the 33-seat local council[1][4]. This representation reflects the presence of a significant French-speaking population in the city, which comprises about 33.7% of the total population. The French-speaking community is particularly concentrated in the Koningslo and Beauval quarters, which border Brussels[1][4].

This arrangement is part of the complex linguistic and political landscape of the region. Vilvoorde is officially Dutch-speaking, as it is located in Flanders, but its proximity to bilingual Brussels and historical factors have resulted in a substantial French-speaking minority. The representation of this minority on the local council is an attempt to ensure their voices are heard in local governance, while still maintaining Dutch as the official language of the municipality.
