No, Jung Whee-in (known professionally as Wheein) was not the only member of the group Mamamoo. Mamamoo is a South Korean girl group that consists of four members[1][3]:

1. Solar (Kim Yong-sun)
2. Moonbyul (Moon Byul-yi) 
3. Wheein (Jung Whee-in)
4. Hwasa (Ahn Hye-jin)

Mamamoo officially debuted on June 18, 2014, under RBW (formerly known as WA Entertainment) with their first extended play titled "Hello"[1][3]. All four members have been part of the group since its inception.

While Wheein has pursued solo activities, including releasing her own music and collaborating with other artists[4], she remains an integral part of Mamamoo. However, it's worth noting that in June 2021, Wheein decided not to renew her exclusive contract with RBW, the group's original agency. Despite this, she signed a separate agreement allowing her to continue participating in Mamamoo's group activities for at least two more years[4]. This arrangement allows Wheein to maintain her presence in the group while also pursuing individual career opportunities.
