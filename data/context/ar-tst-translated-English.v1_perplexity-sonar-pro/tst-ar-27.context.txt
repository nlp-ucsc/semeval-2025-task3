Sioux City is located in the state of Iowa[1][2]. It is situated in the northwestern part of Iowa, specifically in Woodbury and Plymouth counties[1]. Sioux City is the fourth-most populous city in Iowa, with a population of 85,797 as of the 2020 census[1][2].

Some key points about Sioux City's location:

1. It sits at the junction of three states: Iowa, Nebraska, and South Dakota[1][3].
2. The city is positioned along the Missouri River, at the navigational head of the river[1].
3. Its precise geographical coordinates are latitude 42.495132 and longitude -96.400070[3].
4. Sioux City serves as the primary city of a five-county metropolitan area, which had a total population of 149,940 in 2020[1].
5. The surrounding region, including parts of northwestern Iowa, northeastern Nebraska, and southeastern South Dakota, is often collectively referred to as Siouxland[1].

While Sioux City is primarily in Iowa, it's worth noting that it borders two other states: South Dakota to the west-northwest and Nebraska to the west[1]. This unique tri-state location contributes to its role as a regional economic and cultural hub[5].
