Joel Hastings Metcalf discovered the asteroid 661 Cloelia on February 22, 1908[1]. Metcalf was an American astronomer, humanitarian, and Unitarian minister who discovered or co-discovered several comets and 41 asteroids between 1905 and 1914[4]. 

661 Cloelia is a minor planet orbiting the Sun in the main asteroid belt[1]. It is a member of the Eos family of asteroids, which are believed to have formed from the collisional breakup of a parent body[1]. The asteroid is named after Cloelia, a woman from ancient Roman history[1].

Some additional details about 661 Cloelia:

- It has an estimated diameter of 40.081 ± 0.239 kilometers[10]
- Its rotation period is approximately 5.536 hours[10]
- It has an orbital inclination of 9.258 ± 0.001 degrees[10]
- Its absolute magnitude is 9.79[10]

Metcalf made this discovery while serving as a minister, as he combined his religious duties with astronomical research[4]. He used telescopes he designed and built himself to conduct asteroid searches, contributing significantly to the field of asteroid discovery in the early 20th century[4].
