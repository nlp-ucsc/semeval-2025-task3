The Canon EOS 70D replaced the Canon EOS 60D[1][2]. The 70D was announced in July 2013 as the successor to the 60D in Canon's two-digit DSLR lineup[2]. It brought several significant upgrades over its predecessor, including:

1. A new 20.2 megapixel sensor, up from 18 megapixels on the 60D[1].

2. The introduction of Canon's innovative Dual Pixel CMOS AF system, which greatly improved autofocus performance in Live View and video modes[1][2].

3. A faster DIGIC 5+ image processor, replacing the DIGIC 4 in the 60D[1].

4. Improved burst shooting speed of 7 fps, up from 5.3 fps on the 60D[1].

5. A new 19-point all cross-type AF system, compared to the 9-point system on the 60D[1].

6. The addition of built-in Wi-Fi connectivity[1].

7. A touchscreen LCD, which was not present on the 60D[1].

These upgrades positioned the 70D as a significant step up from the 60D, offering improved performance and features for enthusiast photographers and videographers[1][2]. The 70D maintained its position in Canon's lineup between the entry-level Rebel series and the more advanced 7D series[2][3].
