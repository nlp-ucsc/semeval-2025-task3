According to the 2010 census, the predominant racial composition in Manly, Iowa was overwhelmingly White. Specifically, 97.7% of the population identified as White[5]. The remaining racial breakdown was as follows:

- 0.5% African American
- 0.2% Native American
- 0.3% Asian
- 0.3% from other races
- 1.0% from two or more races

Additionally, 2.5% of the population identified as Hispanic or Latino of any race[5].

This racial composition shows that Manly was significantly less diverse than the United States as a whole in 2010. For comparison, the 2010 U.S. Census reported that 72% of the national population identified as White alone[4], which is notably lower than Manly's 97.7% White population.

It's worth noting that more recent data from 2024 estimates show some changes in Manly's racial composition, with the White population decreasing slightly to 87.34% and an increase in those identifying as two or more races to 9.78%[2]. However, the 2010 census data provides the most comprehensive and official breakdown of the racial composition for the specific year requested.
