The scientific name for the genus commonly known as "Aeschne" in French is Aeshna.

Some key details about the Aeshna genus:

1. Aeshna is a genus of dragonflies belonging to the family Aeshnidae[1][5].

2. Species in this genus are generally known as "hawkers" in the Old World and "darners" in the New World[5].

3. The name Aeshna was coined by Danish entomologist Fabricius in the 18th century. It may have resulted from a printer's error in spelling the Greek "Aechma", meaning "a spear"[5].

4. The spelling "Aeschna" was used intermittently in the past but has been abandoned in favor of the original Aeshna. However, some derived genus names (like Rhionaeschna) retain the "sch" spelling[5].

5. Aeshna species are relatively large dragonflies with brown thoraces and abdomens, often featuring blue, yellow, or green markings[5].

6. Some well-known species in this genus include:
   - Aeshna cyanea (blue hawker or southern hawker)[1][5]
   - Aeshna juncea (common hawker or sedge darner)[3]
   - Aeshna canadensis (Canada darner)[4][7]
   - Aeshna grandis (brown hawker)[5]

7. The genus contains numerous species found across North America, Europe, and Asia[5][7].

So in summary, while "Aeschne" may be used as a common name in French, the proper scientific genus name is Aeshna.
