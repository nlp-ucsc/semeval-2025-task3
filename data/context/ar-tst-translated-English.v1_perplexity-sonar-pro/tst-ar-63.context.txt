Melito is located in the Campania region of southern Italy. There are actually two distinct towns with similar names in this region:

1. Melito Irpino: This town is situated in the province of Avellino, Campania[1]. It is located in the northern part of its province, bordering the province of Benevento. Melito Irpino is about 48 km from Avellino, the provincial capital.

2. Melito di Napoli: This is a comune (municipality) in the Metropolitan City of Naples, also in the Campania region[3][4]. It is located about 9 km north of Naples, the regional capital.

Both of these towns are part of the Campania region, which is situated in southwestern Italy. Campania is known for its rich history, beautiful coastline, and famous cities like Naples and Salerno. The region is also home to notable landmarks such as Mount Vesuvius and the ancient ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum.

It's worth noting that while these towns share similar names, they are distinct municipalities with their own unique characteristics and histories within the broader context of the Campania region.
