The Dukan Diet consists of four distinct phases:

1. Attack Phase: This is the initial phase designed to jumpstart weight loss. It typically lasts 2-7 days and focuses on consuming only lean proteins, oat bran, and water[1][2].

2. Cruise Phase: The second phase aims for steady, gradual weight loss. It alternates between "Pure Protein" days and "Protein and Vegetable" days, introducing non-starchy vegetables alongside proteins. This phase continues until you reach your target weight[1][3].

3. Consolidation Phase: The third phase is designed to prevent weight regain. It gradually reintroduces previously restricted foods, including fruits, whole grains, and starchy foods. The duration of this phase is calculated based on the amount of weight lost (5 days for every pound lost)[1][3][4].

4. Stabilization Phase: This is the final, lifelong maintenance phase. It allows more dietary freedom while maintaining certain rules to prevent weight regain. These rules include consuming oat bran daily, having one pure protein day per week, and engaging in regular physical activity[1][3][4].

Each phase has specific dietary guidelines and durations, with the overall goal of promoting rapid initial weight loss followed by long-term weight maintenance[2][4]. The diet emphasizes high protein intake, gradual reintroduction of other food groups, and the development of lasting healthy eating habits[7].
