The opera considered "the most important English opera composed between Purcell and Britten" by Ethel Mary Smyth is "The Wreckers"[1][3][5]. This opera, composed between 1902 and 1904, holds a significant place in English operatic history[4].

"The Wreckers" is based on a distinctly English story inspired by the Isles of Scilly, off the coast of Cornwall[4]. The opera explores themes of morality and social issues, set in a Cornish village[1]. Smyth's dynamic use of orchestration and dramatic storytelling contributed to its success and lasting impact[1].

Some key points about "The Wreckers":

1. It premiered in Leipzig in 1906, initially performed in German as "Das Standrecht"[4].
2. The opera was later produced at Covent Garden in English in 1909[4].
3. In 2022, it was performed at the Glyndebourne Festival Opera, marking the first professional production in its original French libretto[3].
4. The opera's prelude or overture has been included 27 times in BBC Proms performances between 1913 and 1947[3].

Smyth's achievement with "The Wreckers" is particularly noteworthy given the challenges she faced as a female composer in a male-dominated field[1]. The opera's recognition as a pivotal work in English operatic history underscores Smyth's significant contribution to the genre and her role in paving the way for future generations of composers[1].
