The Samnites spoke Oscan, an ancient Italic language[1][2][4]. Oscan was part of the Osco-Umbrian or Sabellic branch of the Italic languages, closely related to Umbrian and more distantly related to Latin[4][5].

Oscan was spoken in southern and central Italy between approximately the 5th and 1st centuries BC[3][4]. The language was used in regions including Samnium, Campania, Lucania, Calabria, and Abruzzo[4][5]. 

Some key points about the Oscan language spoken by the Samnites:

1. It was written using multiple alphabets, including:
   - Its own alphabet adapted from the Etruscan script in the 7th century BC[3]
   - The Latin alphabet
   - The Greek alphabet[3]

2. Oscan is known primarily from inscriptions, as it became extinct after the Roman conquest of the Samnite territories[3][4].

3. It was part of a group of related Sabellic languages, including Umbrian and Volscian[1][4].

4. While Oscan was the main language of the Samnites, it was also spoken by other tribes such as the Aurunci (Ausones) and the Sidicini[3][5].

5. The language disappeared along with Samnite culture after the area was conquered by Rome in the first century AD[3].

The Oscan language provides valuable insights into the linguistic diversity of pre-Roman Italy and the cultural identity of the Samnite people[6][7].
