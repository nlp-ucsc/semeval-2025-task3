According to the Julian calendar, the year 830 AD started on a Saturday[3][7]. This can be determined from the following information:

1. The year 830 (DCCCXXX) was a common year starting on Saturday of the Julian calendar[3].

2. A common year in the Julian calendar has 365 days, as opposed to a leap year which has 366 days[5].

3. The Julian calendar was the predominant calendar used in the Western world at that time, having been introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 BC[5].

It's important to note that the Julian calendar was the standard calendar in use in 830 AD, as the Gregorian calendar reform would not occur until 1582, over 750 years later[5]. The Julian calendar's structure, with its regular pattern of common and leap years, allows for the determination of the starting day of the week for any given year, even those far in the past like 830 AD.
