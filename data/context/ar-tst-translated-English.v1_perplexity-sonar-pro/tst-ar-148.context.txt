Sergei Parajanov is associated with multiple nationalities through his cinematic work and personal background:

1. Armenian: Parajanov was born to ethnic Armenian parents and considered Armenia one of his "motherlands"[1][3]. He directed the Armenian film "The Color of Pomegranates" and is honored with a museum in Yerevan, Armenia[3][5].

2. Georgian: He was born and raised in Tbilisi, Georgia, which he also considered a "motherland"[1][3]. A street in Old Tbilisi is named after him[3].

3. Ukrainian: Parajanov lived and worked in Ukraine for many years, directing Ukrainian-language films like "Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors"[1][3][5]. He is sometimes claimed as a "Ukrainian-Armenian film director"[3].

4. Soviet: As a filmmaker working during the Soviet era, Parajanov is often referred to as a Soviet director[5][7].

5. Russian: He studied filmmaking in Moscow and worked within the Soviet film industry, which was centered in Russia[1][5].

6. Azerbaijani: Parajanov filmed parts of his last completed feature "Ashik Kerib" in Azerbaijan, incorporating Azerbaijani dialogue and music[6].

Parajanov himself embraced this multicultural identity, famously stating: "Everybody knows that I have three motherlands"[3]. His work often blended influences from various Caucasian, Eastern European, and Middle Eastern cultures, reflecting the rich cultural tapestry of the regions where he lived and worked[6][9]. This cultural diversity in Parajanov's background and artistic output makes him a uniquely transnational figure in cinema history.
