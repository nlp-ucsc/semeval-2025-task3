VinFast's global headquarters are located in Singapore, while its operational headquarters remain in Vietnam. However, the company has established regional headquarters in several key markets:

1. United States: VinFast's U.S. headquarters is located in Los Angeles, California[1][2][4]. Specifically, it is situated in the Playa Vista area, known as "Silicon Beach" due to its concentration of tech firms[1][2].

2. Europe: VinFast has established dedicated country headquarters in three European markets[3]:
   - Germany: Frankfurt
   - France: Paris
   - Netherlands: Amsterdam

3. North America: In January 2023, VinFast announced the consolidation of its Canadian and US operations into a single unit called VinFast North America, headquartered in Los Angeles, California[4].

4. Vietnam: While Singapore serves as the legal and financial headquarters, Vietnam remains VinFast's operational headquarters[6]. The company's main production facility is located in Hai Phong, Vietnam, on an 828-acre site[6].

It's worth noting that VinFast is expanding its global presence rapidly. The company is building a manufacturing facility in Chatham County, North Carolina, which is expected to start production by the end of 2025[5][6]. Additionally, VinFast has plans to expand into other markets, including Indonesia and the Philippines[6].
