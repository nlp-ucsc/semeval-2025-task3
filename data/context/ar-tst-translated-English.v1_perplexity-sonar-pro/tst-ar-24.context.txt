The year 186 AD began on a Saturday[1]. This can be determined from the information provided in the search results, specifically from the Wikipedia entry for the year 186, which states:

"Year 186 (CLXXXVI) was a common year starting on Saturday of the Julian calendar."[1]

This means that January 1st, 186 AD fell on a Saturday. The Julian calendar was in use during this time period in the Roman Empire, and it's the calendar system referenced for dating events in this era.

It's worth noting that while January 1st was recognized as the start of the year in the Julian calendar, not all cultures or regions may have observed this as the beginning of the year at that time. However, for the purposes of historical dating and the calendar system in use by the Roman Empire, the year 186 AD is considered to have begun on a Saturday.
