Adolf Galland achieved 104 aerial victories during World War II, all of them against Western Allied forces[1][3][4][7]. As a German Luftwaffe general and flying ace, Galland flew 705 combat missions throughout the war, primarily on the Western Front and in the Defense of the Reich[1][9].

Galland's impressive tally of victories was accumulated over several key campaigns:

1. Battle of France: He scored his first 14 victories during this campaign[7].

2. Battle of Britain: By the end of 1940, Galland had claimed 58 aerial victories[7].

3. Continued combat: He reached 96 victories by November 18, 1941[1].

4. Later war years: Galland added more victories, including some while flying the Me 262 jet fighter[9].

It's worth noting that Galland survived being shot down four times during his combat career[1][3][9]. His skill as a pilot and leader led to his rapid rise through the ranks, eventually becoming the commander of the Luftwaffe's fighter forces from 1941 to 1945[5].

While 104 victories is the widely accepted number, some sources provide slightly different totals. For instance, one source mentions that records in the German Federal Archives show 100 confirmed aerial victory claims, plus nine unconfirmed claims[9]. However, the consensus among most historical sources is that Galland achieved 104 confirmed aerial victories.
