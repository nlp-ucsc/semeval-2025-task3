Emperor Seimu is ranked as the 13th emperor of Japan according to the traditional order of succession[2]. He is considered one of the legendary emperors of Japan, whose existence and reign cannot be historically verified with certainty.

Some key points about Emperor Seimu:

1. He is also known as Wakatarashi hiko no Sumera mikoto (稚足彦天皇)[2].

2. His reign is conventionally dated from 131 to 190 AD[2].

3. Emperor Seimu is best known for organizing local governments by making the first appointments of their kind to provinces under his rule[2].

4. He had only one recorded wife who bore him a single child, and a concubine who had no children[2].

5. When his only son died young, Seimu appointed one of his nephews as crown prince before his death in 190 AD[2].

It's important to note that Emperor Seimu, like many early Japanese emperors, is considered legendary. Modern historians believe that if he did exist, he likely ruled over a much smaller area than modern-day Japan and would have been more of a local chieftain or clan leader rather than an emperor in the later sense of the term[2]. The title "Emperor" (tennō) and the name "Seimu" were likely assigned to him posthumously by later generations[2].

While Emperor Seimu's historical existence is debated, he remains an important figure in the traditional lineage of Japanese emperors.
