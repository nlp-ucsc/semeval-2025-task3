The United States was the primary occupying force in Japan after World War II, though the occupation was nominally carried out under the authority of the Allied Powers[1][8]. Here are the key details about the occupation of Japan:

1. Primary Occupier: The United States led the occupation, with General Douglas MacArthur serving as the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP)[1][9].

2. Duration: The occupation lasted from September 2, 1945, to April 28, 1952[8][9].

3. Allied Involvement:
   - While the occupation was primarily American, there was limited involvement from other Allied nations[4][8].
   - The British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF), consisting of about 40,000 troops from Australia, Britain, India, and New Zealand, participated in the occupation starting from February 21, 1946[8].

4. Soviet Union: Despite initial plans to divide Japan among the Allied Powers (similar to Germany), the Soviet Union did not directly occupy Japan proper. However, they did occupy some outlying territories:
   - Northern Korea
   - South Sakhalin
   - Kuril Islands[8]

5. United States Control: The U.S. had direct control over:
   - The main islands of Japan (Honshu, Hokkaido, Shikoku, and Kyushu)
   - Southern Korea
   - Okinawa Islands
   - Amami Islands
   - Ogasawara Islands
   - Japanese possessions in Micronesia[8]

6. China: While not directly occupying Japan, China gained control over:
   - Taiwan
   - Penghu[8]

It's important to note that although other Allied nations had some involvement, the occupation was overwhelmingly an American operation. The United States made most of the key decisions and implemented policies through General MacArthur and his staff[4][9].
