Sophie Nélisse portrayed the lead role of Liesel Meminger in the film "The Book Thief"[1][2][4]. Liesel is the titular "book thief" - a young German girl who is sent to live with foster parents during World War II[6]. 

Liesel's character is central to the story:

- She begins as an illiterate orphan but develops a love for books and reading after her foster father Hans teaches her[5][6].
- As the Nazi regime burns books, Liesel begins stealing and hiding books[5].
- Her character embodies resilience and the power of words during a dark period in history[6].

The role was Nélisse's first English-speaking part and her performance was highly praised[1][2]. Director Brian Percival said of casting Nélisse: "We knew so much of the success of the film would be down to how well Liesel was played. She is the character of the film really, so it was important to get that right, and I think we have."[1]

Nélisse, who was 13 years old during filming, starred alongside veteran actors Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson, who played her foster parents[1][4]. Her portrayal of Liesel was considered pivotal to the film's success, with many involved in the production praising her talent and presence on screen[2].
