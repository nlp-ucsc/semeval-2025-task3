Cedric Haswell Liddell practiced rowing[1][2]. He was a Canadian rower who competed in the 1932 and 1936 Summer Olympics[1]. 

Liddell was a member of the Canadian men's eights team that won the bronze medal at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles[1][3]. The eights competition involves eight rowers and a coxswain in a boat, working together to propel the vessel as quickly as possible over a 2000-meter course[2].

Liddell was part of the Hamilton, Ontario-based Leander Boat Club[4]. His team made headlines when they won the Olympic trials on July 19, 1932, beating the favored Argonaut crew with an impressive time of 5 minutes 29 and four-fifths seconds, which was reported as the fastest time ever recorded in North America at that point[4].

At the 1932 Olympics, Liddell and his teammates - Albert Taylor, Donald Boal, William Thorburn, Harry Fry, Stanley Stanyar, Joe Harris, Earl Eastwood, and coxswain Les MacDonald - secured the bronze medal for Canada[4]. This achievement remains a source of pride for the Leander Boat Club[4].

Liddell continued his Olympic career by competing again in the eights event at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin[1][5], demonstrating his dedication to the sport of rowing over multiple Olympic cycles.
