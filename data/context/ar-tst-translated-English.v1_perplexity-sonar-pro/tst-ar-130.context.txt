The art of collage has ancient roots, but its modern form emerged in the early 20th century. Here's a detailed overview of its origins:

Ancient Origins:
The technique of collage can be traced back to ancient civilizations. The Chinese were among the first to use this art form after the invention of paper in 200 BC[2]. However, it didn't gain widespread popularity until much later.

Medieval and Renaissance Period:
Collage techniques appeared in medieval Europe during the 13th century. In the 15th and 16th centuries, gold leaf panels were created for Gothic cathedrals using collage-like methods[2].

18th Century:
An early notable practitioner was Mary Delany, an English artist born in 1700. At the age of 72, she began creating over 900 works of paper mosaic art, which would later be recognized as a form of collage[2].

Modern Collage:
The modern concept of collage as we know it today emerged in the early 20th century, primarily associated with Cubist artists.

1. Cubist Origins:
Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso are credited with popularizing collage in the fine art world around 1910-1912[1][3][4]. They introduced the technique of pasting paper and other materials onto canvas, challenging traditional notions of art.

2. First Modern Collage:
Many art historians consider Pablo Picasso's "Still Life with Chair Caning" (1912) to be the first modern collage[7]. This work incorporated oilcloth printed with a chair-caning pattern and a piece of rope framing the canvas.

3. Papier Collé:
Georges Braque is often credited with creating the first papier collé (literally "glued paper") in 1912[1]. Legend has it that he was inspired by a wallpaper shop in Avignon, where he purchased wood-grain wallpaper to incorporate into his work.

4. Expansion and Evolution:
From its Cubist origins, collage quickly spread to other art movements:
- Dada artists in the 1920s expanded the use of materials, incorporating everyday items and ephemera[4].
- Surrealists adopted the technique to create dreamlike and fantastical compositions[4].
- Later movements like Pop Art continued to use and evolve collage techniques[6].

In summary, while the concept of assembling different materials has ancient roots, modern collage as an artistic technique emerged in the early 20th century, primarily through the work of Cubist artists like Braque and Picasso. From there, it rapidly evolved and spread across various art movements, becoming a significant and versatile technique in modern and contemporary art.
