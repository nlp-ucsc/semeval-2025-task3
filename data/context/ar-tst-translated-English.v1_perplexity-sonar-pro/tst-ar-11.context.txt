Based on the search results provided, there is limited information about the specific herb "Dhaba" and its plant family. However, we can extract some relevant information:

The search results mention "Dhaba" in the context of wild edible plants traditionally collected and used in southern Yemen[9]. According to this source, "Dhaba" (also referred to as "Dhagohom") is described as an herb that is collected during the rainy season. The young stem of this plant is eaten fresh and has a mild bitter taste.

Unfortunately, the search results do not explicitly state the plant family to which "Dhaba" belongs. The study mentioned in the search results identified a total of 60 plant species belonging to 31 families, but it doesn't provide specific family information for "Dhaba"[9].

Without more specific botanical information or scientific names associated with "Dhaba," it's not possible to definitively determine its plant family based on the given search results. To accurately identify the plant family of "Dhaba," we would need additional information such as its scientific name, detailed botanical characteristics, or a more comprehensive ethnobotanical study of the region.

If you have access to more information about this plant, such as its scientific name or detailed botanical features, it would be helpful in determining its taxonomic classification and plant family.
