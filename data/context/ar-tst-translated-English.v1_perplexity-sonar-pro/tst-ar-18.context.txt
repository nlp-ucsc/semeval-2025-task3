Heinz Holliger was born on May 21, 1939 in Langenthal, Switzerland[1][2][3]. Langenthal is a town located in the canton of Bern in Switzerland[3]. Specifically, Langenthal is situated in the Oberaargau region of the canton of Bern[3].

Holliger grew up in the Swiss countryside[2]. He came from a family of physicians, though his parents were not particularly musical, aside from his father being an amateur violinist[1][2]. This rural Swiss upbringing provided the backdrop for Holliger's early musical development, as he began playing recorder at age 4 and piano at age 6 before eventually taking up the oboe at age 11[2].
