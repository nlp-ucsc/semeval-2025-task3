The Battle of Long Island is also known by two other names:

1. Battle of Brooklyn[1][2][3][4]
2. Battle of Brooklyn Heights[1][2][3]

These alternative names refer to the same military engagement that took place on August 27, 1776, during the American Revolutionary War. The battle is called by these different names because it was fought in the area that is now known as Brooklyn, New York City, which was part of Long Island at the time.

The battle occurred shortly after the United States declared independence and was the first major battle to take place after this declaration[3]. It was a significant engagement in the American Revolutionary War, involving around 40,000 soldiers, making it one of the largest battles of the entire conflict[2].

The use of multiple names for this battle reflects the geographic area where it took place, with "Long Island" referring to the larger region, while "Brooklyn" and "Brooklyn Heights" specify the more precise location within what is now a borough of New York City.
