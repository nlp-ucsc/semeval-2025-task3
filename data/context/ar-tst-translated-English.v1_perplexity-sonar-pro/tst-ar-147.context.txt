The capital of Yushu City is Gyêgu, also known as Jiegu or Yushu town. Gyêgu serves as both the administrative center of Yushu City and the seat of the larger Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture[1][2].

Some key points about Gyêgu:

1. Location: It is built in the valley of the Batang River, a tributary of the Tongtian River, which eventually becomes part of the Yangtze River system[1].

2. Importance: Gyêgu is one of the oldest towns in Qinghai Province and has historically been an important trade hub. It is situated at the crossroads of major trade routes connecting Ya'an, Xining, and Lhasa[1].

3. Administrative status: Gyêgu is officially designated as a subdistrict (街道) within Yushu City's administrative divisions[1][2].

4. Alternative names: The town is known by several names:
   - Gyêgu in Tibetan
   - Jiegu (结古) in Chinese
   - Yushu, which is also the name of the larger city and prefecture[1][2]

5. Population: As of 2010, the city core, which primarily refers to Gyêgu, had a population of 56,802[1].

6. Cultural significance: Gyêgu is home to several important religious and cultural sites, including the Gyegu Monastery, which is located on a hill overlooking the town[2].

7. Recent history: In 2010, Gyêgu was severely impacted by a major earthquake that caused significant damage to the town and surrounding areas[1][9].

Gyêgu's role as the capital of Yushu City makes it the political, economic, and cultural center of both the city and the larger Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture[3].
