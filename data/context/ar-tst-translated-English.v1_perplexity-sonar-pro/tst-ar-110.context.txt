Frances Farmer died of esophageal cancer on August 1, 1970, at the age of 56[1]. She was diagnosed with this cancer in the spring of 1970, which was attributed to her long-term heavy smoking habit[1][2]. 

Farmer's battle with cancer was brief. After her diagnosis, she was hospitalized for three weeks before being sent home for a short period[1]. She ultimately passed away at Indianapolis Community Hospital[1]. 

It's worth noting that esophageal cancer is often associated with long-term tobacco use, which aligns with reports of Farmer's smoking habits[2][9]. Her death came just weeks before what would have been her 57th birthday[5].

Farmer's life was marked by numerous challenges, including struggles with mental health, substance abuse, and institutionalization. However, in her final years, she had experienced some stability, hosting a television show in Indianapolis and taking on roles in theater productions at Purdue University[7]. The cancer diagnosis came as she was working on her autobiography, which she unfortunately did not complete before her death[6].
