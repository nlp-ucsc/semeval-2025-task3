Infiniti G cars are manufactured by Infiniti, which is the luxury vehicle division of Nissan Motor Corporation[1][3]. Nissan is the Japanese automaker that owns and produces the Infiniti brand[2][4][5][6][7][8].

The Infiniti G Line was a series of compact executive cars produced from 1991 to 2016 across four generations[1]. Here are some key details about the Infiniti G's manufacturing history:

1. The first two generations (P10 and P11) were sedans based on the Nissan Primera[1].

2. Starting with the third generation (V35), Infiniti G models became rebadged versions of the Nissan Skyline line of sedans and coupes exported to North America[1].

3. The G35, introduced in 2002, marked a significant shift from the front-wheel-drive Primera platform to the rear-wheel-drive Skyline platform[1].

4. Infiniti G cars were primarily assembled in Japan. For example, the G35 was built at the Tochigi Plant in Kaminokawa, Tochigi, Japan[1].

5. The Infiniti G Line was eventually succeeded by the Infiniti Q50 for sedans and the Infiniti Q60 for coupes and convertibles[1].

It's worth noting that while Infiniti is a distinct luxury brand, it leverages Nissan's manufacturing capabilities and platforms. The relationship between Nissan and Infiniti allows for shared technologies and resources in the production of Infiniti vehicles, including the G Line.
