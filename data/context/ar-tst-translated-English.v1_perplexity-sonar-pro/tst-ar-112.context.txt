The scientific name Agastache originates from Ancient Greek and has the following meaning:

Agastache is derived from two Greek words:

1. "Agan" (ἄγαν) meaning "very much" or "a lot of"
2. "Stachys" (στάχυς) meaning "an ear of grain" or "spike"

When combined, Agastache literally means "many spikes" or "a lot of spikes"[1][3]. This name was chosen to describe the plant's distinctive flower spikes, which are a key characteristic of the genus[5].

The name was formally established in 1762 by Dutch botanist Jan Frederik Gronovius in the second edition of his Flora Virginica[4]. It's worth noting that the work was based on specimens and notes provided by English botanist John Clayton, who had given the genus name to these perennial flowering herbs in the 1730s[4].

The pronunciation of Agastache is /ˌæɡəˈstɑːkiː/[1].

This naming convention follows a common practice in botanical nomenclature, where the scientific name often describes a distinctive feature of the plant. In this case, the name Agastache aptly captures the multiple upright spikes of tubular flowers that characterize plants in this genus[1][6].
