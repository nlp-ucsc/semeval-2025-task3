Ashoka became emperor of the Mauryan Empire in 268 BCE[1][2][6]. He was the third ruler of the Mauryan dynasty, succeeding his father Bindusara[4][5]. 

Ashoka, also known as Ashoka the Great, ruled over a vast empire that encompassed most of the Indian subcontinent[1][4]. At its height under Ashoka's reign, the Mauryan Empire stretched from parts of modern-day Afghanistan and Iran in the west to Bangladesh in the east, and covered nearly all of India except for the southern tip[1][4][6].

Some key details about Ashoka's ascension and reign:

- He came to power in 268 BCE after defeating his brothers in a succession struggle following Bindusara's death[3][7].
- His reign lasted from 268 BCE to 232 BCE, a period of about 36-37 years[1][2][8].
- The capital of his empire was Pataliputra (modern-day Patna)[4].
- He expanded the empire further, most notably conquering the Kalinga region (modern Odisha) around 260 BCE in a brutal war[1][10].
- The bloodshed of the Kalinga war reportedly led Ashoka to renounce violence and convert to Buddhism, after which he promoted Buddhist values and non-violence throughout his reign[1][10].

Ashoka is considered one of the most important rulers in Indian history, known for his military conquests early in his reign and his subsequent embrace of Buddhist principles and efforts to rule ethically[10]. His reign marked the peak of the Mauryan Empire's territorial extent and power[6][7].
