BMW started producing the first generation of the BMW X2 in 2017. The original X2 (F39) was introduced as a 2018 model year vehicle and remained in production until 2022[3]. 

The second generation BMW X2, which is the current model, has just entered production in 2023. Specifically:

1. Production of the new second-generation BMW X2 (U10) and its electric variant iX2 began in November 2023 at BMW's Regensburg plant in Germany[1][4].

2. This new X2 represents a significant redesign and is larger than its predecessor. It's being manufactured alongside the mechanically related X1 and iX1 models[1].

3. The worldwide market launch for this new generation X2 is scheduled for March 2024[5].

4. The new X2 lineup includes gasoline, diesel, and fully electric (iX2) powertrains[1].

So in summary, while the X2 model line began in 2017, the all-new second generation that's just entering production started in late 2023, with customer deliveries set to begin in early 2024.
