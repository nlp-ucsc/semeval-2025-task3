Gervais' beaked whale (Mesoplodon europaeus) is a species of toothed whale belonging to the family Ziphiidae, also known as beaked whales[1][3]. 

Some key points about the classification and characteristics of Gervais' beaked whale:

1. It is a marine mammal, specifically a cetacean (whale, dolphin, or porpoise)[1][3].

2. It belongs to the genus Mesoplodon, which includes 15 species of beaked whales[2].

3. As a beaked whale, it is part of the second-largest cetacean family after dolphins[2].

4. Gervais' beaked whales are found in deep tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate waters of the Atlantic Ocean[3].

5. They are medium-sized whales, with adults reaching lengths of about 15-17 feet (4.5-5.2 meters) and weighing at least 2,640 pounds (1,200 kg)[1][3].

6. Like other beaked whales, they have a streamlined body shape adapted for deep diving, with small pectoral fins and a small triangular dorsal fin[2].

7. Males can be distinguished by two visible teeth that erupt from the front of their lower jaw, while females and juveniles have hidden teeth[3].

8. Their coloration is typically dark gray or bluish-black on top, fading to a lighter gray on the underside[3][5].

In summary, Gervais' beaked whale is a deep-diving marine mammal species within the beaked whale family, adapted for life in the open ocean and feeding primarily on squid and fish in deep waters[1][2][3].
