The main disadvantage of an H-shaped engine in racing cars is its high center of gravity[2]. This elevated center of gravity can negatively impact the car's handling and performance on the track.

Some key points about the disadvantages of H engines in racing applications:

1. Weight distribution: The H engine configuration places significant weight higher up in the engine bay compared to other layouts like flat or V engines. This raises the car's overall center of gravity[2].

2. Handling impacts: A higher center of gravity reduces cornering ability and can lead to more body roll in turns, which is undesirable for racing[3].

3. Complexity: H engines are more complex than simpler inline or V configurations, with two separate flat engine blocks and crankshafts[2]. This added complexity can increase manufacturing costs and maintenance requirements.

4. Size constraints: H engines tend to be wider than comparable inline or V engines, which can create packaging challenges in a race car chassis[9].

5. Maintenance difficulties: The layout of H engines, with cylinder heads on the sides, can make access for repairs and maintenance more challenging[9].

6. Weight: Despite some advantages, H engines can be heavier than other configurations, which is a significant drawback in racing where minimizing weight is crucial[1].

7. Vibration issues: Some H engine designs have suffered from torsional vibration problems, requiring additional engineering solutions that add weight[5].

While H engines have some unique advantages, these drawbacks have limited their widespread adoption in modern racing applications. Most racing teams and manufacturers have opted for more conventional V or inline engine configurations that offer better overall performance characteristics for competitive motorsports.
