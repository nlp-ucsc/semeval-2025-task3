Horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) flowers typically come in white or pink colors, with some variation depending on the specific species or cultivar:

1. White flowers: The common horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) produces large, upright panicles of white flowers with pink or yellow blotches at the base of the petals[3][6]. These white flowers are usually 1 to 1Â¼ inches across with 4 or 5 petals[6].

2. Pink to red flowers: The red horse chestnut (Aesculus x carnea), which is a hybrid between A. hippocastanum and A. pavia, produces flowers that range from pink to red[1][2]. The specific shade can vary depending on the cultivar:

   - 'Briotii' has dark rosy red flowers with yellow throats[1].
   - 'Fort McNair' produces reddish-pink flowers with yellow throats[1][2].
   - 'O'Neil's Red' has deep red flowers[1].

3. Color variations: Some horse chestnut flowers may display a combination of colors. For example, the petals might be white with a pink flush at the base[4]. The red horse chestnut can have flowers with complex color patterns, including yellow, pink, white, orange, and red all visible on each paniculate cluster[9].

4. Stamens and style: Regardless of the petal color, the stamens of horse chestnut flowers are typically white with deep orange tips (anthers), while the style is usually white[6].

It's worth noting that the flower color can be quite striking against the dark green foliage of the horse chestnut tree, creating a beautiful display when in full bloom[8].
