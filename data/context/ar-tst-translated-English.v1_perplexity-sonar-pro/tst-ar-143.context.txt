The term "colicweed" can refer to multiple plants belonging to different families, so there isn't a single definitive answer. Let's break down the information from the search results:

1. Aletris farinosa (Colic Root):
This plant, also known as colic root, belongs to the Nartheciaceae family[1][4]. It was formerly classified in the Lily family but has since been reclassified.

2. Dicentra canadensis (Squirrel Corn):
This plant, which is also sometimes called colicweed, belongs to the Papaveraceae family (poppy family)[2][5]. It was previously classified in the Fumariaceae family (fumitory family), but recent taxonomic changes have placed it within Papaveraceae.

3. Corydalis species:
Some Corydalis species are also referred to as colicweed. Like Dicentra, these plants now belong to the Papaveraceae family[5][7].

4. Aletris species:
The genus Aletris, which includes several species known as colicroot or colicweed, belongs to the Nartheciaceae family[4][6].

5. Corydalis flavula (Yellow Harlequin):
This specific species, also called colicweed, is part of the Papaveraceae family[6][7].

In summary, plants referred to as "colicweed" can belong to either the Nartheciaceae family (in the case of Aletris species) or the Papaveraceae family (in the case of Dicentra and Corydalis species). The classification depends on which specific plant is being referred to by the common name "colicweed."
