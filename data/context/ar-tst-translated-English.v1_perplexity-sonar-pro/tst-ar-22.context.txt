I apologize, but I don't have accurate information about who specifically served as mayor of Wyandotte (which I assume you meant instead of "Wenditte") during the period from 2008 to 2014. The search results provided do not contain details about Wyandotte's mayors for that specific time frame.

However, I can provide some relevant information about Wyandotte's mayoral system:

1. Wyandotte is a city in Michigan that has had a mayoral system of government[6].

2. The city maintains a list of past mayors, indicating that they keep historical records of their leadership[6].

3. The current mayor of Wyandotte is Robert A. DeSana, who is described as a lifelong resident of the city[7].

4. Wyandotte's government includes a Mayor and City Council structure[7].

To get accurate information about who served as mayor of Wyandotte from 2008 to 2014, you would need to consult official city records or contact the Wyandotte city government directly. They likely maintain detailed records of past mayors and their terms of office.
