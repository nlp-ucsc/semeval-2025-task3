De Havilland Canada currently manufactures the Dash 8 aircraft[1][2]. The company acquired the Dash 8 program from Bombardier in 2019[1]. However, production of the Dash 8-400, which was the last model in the Dash 8 line, was paused in 2022 due to decreased demand during the Covid-19 pandemic[1].

Key points about the current status of Dash 8 manufacturing:

1. De Havilland Canada is considering restarting Dash 8 production, with a decision expected in 2025[1][2].

2. The company is currently gathering feedback from customers about potential updates or new variants of the Dash 8[1][4].

3. De Havilland is developing a new production facility called De Havilland Field near Calgary, which could potentially house future Dash 8 production[1][4].

4. While new production is paused, De Havilland has established a refurbishment program for existing Dash 8 aircraft[1][9]. This program involves acquiring used Dash 8s, performing maintenance and upgrades, and then reselling them to customers.

5. As of 2024, there are still nearly 800 Dash 8 aircraft in service globally, including about 400 Dash 8-400s[1].

6. De Havilland is considering various options for the future of the Dash 8 program, including potentially launching an updated variant or even developing a brand new regional aircraft[2].

In summary, while De Havilland Canada currently holds the rights to manufacture the Dash 8, new production is temporarily paused. The company is actively working on plans for the future of the program, with a decision on restarting or updating production expected in 2025.
