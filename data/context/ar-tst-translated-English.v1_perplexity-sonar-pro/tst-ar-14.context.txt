Pula is the largest city in the Istrian Peninsula[1][4][5]. Located at the southern tip of Istria in western Croatia, Pula is a major port and industrial center with a population of 52,220 as of 2021[5]. It is the seventh-largest city in Croatia and serves as the administrative center of Istria County[5].

Pula has a rich history dating back over 3,000 years. The city is renowned for its well-preserved ancient Roman buildings, most notably the Pula Arena - one of the six largest surviving Roman amphitheaters in the world[5]. Built in the 1st century CE, this elliptical amphitheater could seat 23,000 spectators and is still used today for summer events and film festivals[4][5].

In addition to its historical significance, Pula is an important economic hub for the region:

1. It features a large, almost landlocked harbor that houses a naval base and the Uljanik shipyards[4].
2. The city has a long tradition of wine making, fishing, and tourism[5].
3. Its industries include machinery, textiles, cement, and glass manufacturing[4].

While Pula is the largest city, it's worth noting that the Istrian Peninsula is home to several other significant towns, including Rovinj, Porec, and Motovun, each offering unique cultural and historical attractions[3][6]. The peninsula itself is shared by three countries - Croatia, Slovenia, and Italy - with Croatia controlling about 90% of its area[8].
