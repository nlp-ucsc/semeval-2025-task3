Abdul Rahman Arif lost his brother Abdul Salam Arif in a plane crash that occurred on April 13, 1966[3][5]. The incident involved an Iraqi Air Force de Havilland DH.104 Dove 1 aircraft, which crashed in southern Iraq, approximately 10 kilometers from Basra Airport[3]. 

Abdul Salam Arif was serving as the President of Iraq at the time of his death. He had been in office since 1963 and was known for his role in the 1958 revolution that overthrew the Iraqi monarchy[5]. The crash occurred while he was traveling, though initial reports at the time mistakenly stated it was a helicopter accident[3].

Following Abdul Salam Arif's death, there was a brief power struggle. Abd al-Rahman al-Bazzaz served as acting president for three days[3]. Subsequently, Abdul Rahman Arif, the brother of the deceased president, was elected to succeed him as the new President of Iraq[3][7]. This transition marked a significant moment in Iraqi political history, as it represented a continuation of the Arif family's leadership but under unexpected and tragic circumstances.

The cause of the crash that killed Abdul Salam Arif was not explicitly stated in the provided search results, leaving some ambiguity about whether it was due to mechanical failure, weather conditions, or other factors.
