Trần Đại Quang was the President of Vietnam before Đặng Thị Ngọc Thịnh became the Acting President[1][4]. Trần Đại Quang served as the President of Vietnam until his death on September 21, 2018[4]. Upon his passing, Vice President Đặng Thị Ngọc Thịnh assumed the role of Acting President, making her the first woman in Vietnamese history to hold the position of President or Acting President[1][4].

Some key points about this transition:

1. Trần Đại Quang's presidency: He was a former chief of internal security who was appointed to the presidency in 2016[8].

2. Đặng Thị Ngọc Thịnh's appointment: She became the Acting President immediately following Trần Đại Quang's death on September 21, 2018[4][6].

3. Historical significance: Thịnh's appointment marked the first time a woman held the position of head of state in Vietnam[4][6]. She was also the first female head of state in a communist country since Soong Ching-ling of China[4].

4. Duration of acting presidency: Thịnh served as Acting President from September 21, 2018, until the election and swearing-in of Nguyễn Phú Trọng on October 23, 2018[1][4].

It's worth noting that while this appointment was historically significant, it was temporary. The Communist Party of Vietnam later put forward General Secretary Nguyễn Phú Trọng as their sole candidate for the presidency, and he was expected to be confirmed in October 2018[9].
