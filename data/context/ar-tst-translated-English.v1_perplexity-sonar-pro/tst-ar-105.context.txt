Early Christian churches typically featured a specific type of vaulted arcade known as the barrel vault. The barrel vault was a simple, semicircular arched structure that ran the length of the nave, creating a tunnel-like ceiling[2]. 

However, it's important to note that the most distinctive feature of early Christian church architecture was not so much the vaulting, but rather the overall basilica plan adapted from Roman civic buildings. This plan included:

1. A long nave flanked by side aisles[4][5]
2. A semicircular apse at the eastern end containing the altar[1][4]
3. Clerestory windows high on the walls to provide light[4]
4. An atrium or courtyard at the entrance[4][5]
5. A narthex or entrance hall[4][5]

The nave was typically covered with a wooden roof rather than stone vaulting in the earliest churches[2]. Stone vaulting became more common in later periods, particularly with the development of ribbed vaults in Romanesque and Gothic architecture[3].

It's worth noting that while barrel vaults were used in some early Christian churches, particularly in side aisles, the more complex rib vaults and pointed arches that characterize Gothic architecture didn't appear until much later[3][9]. These later innovations allowed for taller, more light-filled spaces and were not typical of early Christian architecture.
