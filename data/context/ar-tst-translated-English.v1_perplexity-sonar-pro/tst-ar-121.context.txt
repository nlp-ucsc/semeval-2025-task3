Ephialtes appears as one of the six giants placed in the great pit separating the eighth and ninth circles of Hell in Dante Alighieri's "Inferno," which is the first part of his epic poem "The Divine Comedy"[1][3][4].

In Canto 31 of the Inferno, Dante and his guide Virgil encounter several giants as they approach the ninth and final circle of Hell. Ephialtes is specifically mentioned as one of these giants[1][3]. He is described as being chained and immobilized as punishment for challenging Jupiter (also known as Jove), the king of the gods in Roman mythology[3][4].

Dante portrays Ephialtes as a figure of pride and rebellion against divine authority. The text describes him as having "tested his force against the force of highest Jove"[1]. This refers to the mythological uprising of the giants against the Olympian gods, in which Ephialtes and his twin brother Otus attempted to stack mountains to reach and overthrow the gods[1][4].

In Dante's vision, Ephialtes is depicted as a terrifying figure. When Virgil mentions another giant named Briareus, Ephialtes reacts by shaking and struggling against his chains, frightening Dante[1]. This portrayal emphasizes the continuing defiance and anger of the giant, even in his eternal punishment.

The placement of Ephialtes and the other giants at the boundary between the eighth and ninth circles is significant. The eighth circle punishes various forms of fraud, while the ninth and deepest circle is reserved for traitors. By positioning the giants here, Dante suggests that their rebellion against the gods represents a profound form of betrayal against the divine order[4][5].
