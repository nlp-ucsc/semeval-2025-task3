Karen Percy was born in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada on October 10, 1966[1][4]. While some sources incorrectly state she was born in Banff, Alberta, the most authoritative source (The Canadian Encyclopedia) clearly indicates she was born in Edmonton[1]. 

Her family moved to Banff when Karen was in Grade 3, which may explain the confusion in some sources about her birthplace[1]. In Banff, she joined the Banff Ski Runners and the Nancy Greene League at Mount Norquay, which helped launch her skiing career[1].

Percy began skiing at age five, with her parents often taking the family to Banff on weekends before they moved there permanently[1]. This early exposure to skiing in Banff likely contributed to her later success as an alpine skier, culminating in her winning two bronze medals for Canada at the 1988 Olympic Winter Games in Calgary[1].
