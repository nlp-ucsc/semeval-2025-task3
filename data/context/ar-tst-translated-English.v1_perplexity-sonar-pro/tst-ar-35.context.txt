Clifford Glenwood Shull earned his doctoral degree in Nuclear Physics from New York University in 1941[2][6].

Shull's educational journey began at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University), where he initially entered to study aeronautical engineering. However, after six months, he found himself drawn to physics[9]. This change in interest was partly influenced by a freshman physics course taught by Harry Hower, the head of the physics department, whose classes were described as entertaining and inspiring[4].

After completing his undergraduate studies at Carnegie Tech in 1937, Shull pursued graduate education at New York University. His decision to attend NYU was influenced by a recommendation from his undergraduate mentor, Emerson Pugh, and the attractive stipend for teaching assistants offered by the university[4].

During his time at NYU, Shull worked as a teaching assistant from 1937 to 1941 while completing his doctoral studies[6]. His Ph.D. research focused on nuclear physics, culminating in the award of his doctorate in 1941[2][3]. This educational background in nuclear physics laid the foundation for Shull's future groundbreaking work in neutron scattering techniques, for which he would later receive the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1994.
