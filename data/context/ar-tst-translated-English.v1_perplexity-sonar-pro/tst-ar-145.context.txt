The orbital cavity is formed by seven bones[1][2][3]. These bones are:

1. Frontal bone
2. Sphenoid bone
3. Ethmoid bone
4. Maxilla
5. Zygomatic bone
6. Lacrimal bone
7. Palatine bone

These seven bones contribute to different parts of the orbital cavity:

## Walls of the Orbit

1. Roof (Superior Wall):
   - Formed by the frontal bone and the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone[1][6]

2. Floor (Inferior Wall):
   - Composed of the maxillary bone, palatine bone, and the orbital plate of the zygomatic bone[1][6]

3. Medial Wall:
   - Consists of the frontal process of the maxilla, lacrimal bone, orbital plate of the ethmoid bone, and the body of the sphenoid bone[1]

4. Lateral Wall:
   - Formed by the zygomatic bone and the greater wing of the sphenoid bone[6]

## Important Features

- The orbit is pear-shaped, with the optic nerve at the stem[1]
- The orbital margin, or rim, is the anterior opening of the orbit and has a quadrilateral shape[1][6]
- The lamina papyracea, part of the ethmoid bone in the medial wall, is extremely thin and prone to fractures[5]
- Several foramina and fissures allow passage of important neurovascular structures, including the optic canal, superior orbital fissure, and inferior orbital fissure[3][6]

Understanding the complex anatomy of the orbital cavity is crucial for medical professionals, especially in fields like ophthalmology, neurosurgery, and maxillofacial surgery, as it helps in diagnosing and treating various orbital conditions and injuries.
