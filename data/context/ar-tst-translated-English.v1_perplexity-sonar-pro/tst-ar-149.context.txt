Fredrikstad Football Club's home kit features red and white colors[1][2]. The club has traditionally used these colors since 1926, when they were inspired by the Polish national team after playing a friendly match against Poland[1].

The red and white color scheme has been a consistent element in Fredrikstad FK's home kits throughout their history. This is evident from various sources:

1. The club's official website mentions that they adopted "the main colors of red and hvite" (hvite meaning white in Norwegian) after being inspired by the Polish national team[1].

2. The logo of Fredrikstad FK prominently features white and red colors[2].

3. Historical kit archives show that red has been the dominant color for their home kits over the years, often complemented with white elements[4][7].

For example, the 2023 home kit, produced by Craft, continued this tradition with a predominantly red design[9]. This color scheme not only represents the club's identity but also pays homage to its long-standing history dating back to 1903[1].

It's worth noting that while the exact design and pattern of the home kit may vary from season to season, the core red and white color combination remains a constant, symbolizing the club's heritage and tradition in Norwegian football.
