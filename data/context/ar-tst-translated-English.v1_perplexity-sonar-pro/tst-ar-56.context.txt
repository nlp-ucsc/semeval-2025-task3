The 2018 Chinese Grand Prix was held at the Shanghai International Circuit in Shanghai, China[1]. This circuit, located in the Jiading District on the outskirts of Shanghai, has been the home of the Chinese Grand Prix since its inception in 2004[2][3].

The Shanghai International Circuit is a purpose-built Formula One track designed by renowned circuit architect Hermann Tilke. It features a unique layout inspired by the Chinese character "shang" (上), which means "above" or "ascend"[3]. The circuit is 5.451 km (3.387 miles) long and consists of 16 turns[1][3].

Some key features of the Shanghai International Circuit include:

1. A massive main grandstand and pit complex that can hold up to 30,000 spectators[3].
2. One of the longest straights on the Formula One calendar, measuring 1.2 km (0.7 mi) between turns 13 and 14[3].
3. A unique paddock design featuring team buildings arranged on stilts over a lake, reminiscent of Shanghai's ancient Yu Garden[6].
4. A total capacity of 200,000 spectators, making it one of the largest circuits on the Formula One calendar[4].
