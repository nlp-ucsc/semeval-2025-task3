Construction of Steinway Tower, also known as 111 West 57th Street, began in 2013[1]. The project was initially unveiled in 2013, and groundwork started the following year in 2014[2]. However, it's worth noting that there was a temporary halt in construction in 2017 due to financial reasons[2]. Despite this brief interruption, work resumed, and the skyscraper reached its full height in 2018[2].

The construction process for this remarkable building was lengthy and complex, befitting its status as one of the world's most unique skyscrapers. Some key milestones in the construction timeline include:

1. 2013: Project unveiled and initial construction began
2. 2014: Groundwork started
3. 2017: Temporary halt due to financial reasons
4. 2018: Building reached its full height
5. 2019: Concrete form topped out in April[3]
6. 2021: Exterior hoist dismantled in March, signaling near-completion[3]
7. 2022: Building completed and began welcoming residents in April[1]

The construction of Steinway Tower required significant engineering feats, including the use of 49,000 cubic yards of concrete[3]. The building's slender design and extreme height posed unique challenges, making its construction a remarkable achievement in modern architecture and engineering.
