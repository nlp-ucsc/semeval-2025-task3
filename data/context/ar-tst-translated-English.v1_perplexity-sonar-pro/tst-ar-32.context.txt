Charles Camilleri was Maltese[1][2]. He was born on September 7, 1931 in Ä¦amrun, Malta and died on January 3, 2009 in Naxxar, Malta[1][3]. Camilleri is recognized as one of the major Maltese composers of his generation[2]. His works often drew inspiration from Maltese folk music and culture, including compositions like the Malta Suite, Maltese Dances, and operas in the Maltese language[1][2]. Camilleri's international reputation was built on his ability to blend Maltese and Mediterranean musical influences with broader European and global styles[4]. Despite achieving international recognition, Camilleri maintained strong ties to his Maltese heritage throughout his career as a composer and educator.
