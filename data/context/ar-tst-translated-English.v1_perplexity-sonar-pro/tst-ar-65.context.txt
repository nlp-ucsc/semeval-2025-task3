Maria Grever became famous for her contributions to popular music, particularly in the genre of boleros[1][3]. She was a prolific composer who wrote over 1,000 songs, with the majority of them being boleros[3]. 

Grever's musical style was characterized by:

1. Blending popular song forms with folk rhythms and Latin American styles[2][4].
2. Incorporating elements of Mexican and Spanish musical traditions, especially tangos[9].
3. Creating romantic ballads and songs with universal appeal[4].

Some of her most notable works include:

- "JÃºrame" (Promise, Me): A habanera-bolero that became her first international hit[3][7].
- "What a Difference a Day Makes" (originally "Cuando Vuelva a Tu Lado"): One of her biggest hits, which later won a Grammy when performed by Dinah Washington[7].
- "Ti-Pi-Tin": Her first big hit in the United States[4].

Grever's music bridged the gap between classical and popular genres[1]. She composed for various mediums, including:

- Film scores for major studios like Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox[3][4].
- One-act operas and Broadway musicals[4][9].
- Choral works and instrumental pieces[4].

Her compositions often featured lush romantic melodies with Spanish lyrics, which were sometimes translated into English to reach a wider American audience[4]. Grever's work was instrumental in introducing Latin-influenced music to American audiences in the 1930s and 1940s, contributing to the growing popularity of Latin music in the United States[4].
