Mario Bolatti primarily played as a midfielder, with his main position being a defensive midfielder. Here's a detailed breakdown of his positions:

1. Primary Position: Defensive Midfielder (Centre)
   Bolatti was primarily deployed as a central defensive midfielder[1][2][5][6]. This position requires a player to sit in front of the defense, break up opposition attacks, and distribute the ball to more attacking players.

2. Secondary Position: Central Midfielder
   He was also capable of playing as a central midfielder[1][2], which involves a more balanced role between defense and attack.

3. Occasional Position: Centre Back
   Some sources indicate that Bolatti could also play as a centre back when needed[2], showcasing his defensive capabilities.

Additional details about Bolatti's playing characteristics:

- Preferred Foot: Right[1][4][6]
- Height: 189-190 cm (approximately 6'2"-6'3")[1][4][5][6]
- Nationality: Argentina[1][2][4][5]

Bolatti's versatility in midfield positions, particularly his ability to play as both a defensive midfielder and a central midfielder, made him a valuable asset to his teams. His height (189-190 cm) would have been advantageous for aerial duels and defensive responsibilities, especially when playing in deeper midfield roles.
