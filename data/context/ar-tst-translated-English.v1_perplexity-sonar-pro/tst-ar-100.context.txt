The seismic belt that leads seismic activity in the world before the Alpine belt is the Circum-Pacific belt, also known as the Pacific Ring of Fire[2][4]. This belt is the most seismically active region in the world, accounting for approximately 70-81% of the world's largest earthquakes[2][4].

The Circum-Pacific seismic belt encompasses the Pacific Ocean, including:

- The west coast of South America (Chile, Peru)
- Central America (Guatemala, Mexico)
- The west coast of North America (United States)
- The Aleutian Islands
- The Kuril Islands
- The Japanese Islands
- Taiwan
- The Ryukyu Islands
- The Philippines
- Indonesia
- New Zealand

This horseshoe-shaped zone of intense seismic and volcanic activity stretches for about 40,000 kilometers (25,000 miles) along the boundaries of the Pacific Plate[4]. The high seismic activity in this region is due to the subduction of oceanic plates beneath continental plates and the collision between tectonic plates.

In contrast, the Alpine-Himalayan belt (also known as the Alpide belt), which includes the Alps and the Himalayas, is the second most seismically active region in the world. It accounts for about 15-17% of the world's largest earthquakes[3][5]. This belt extends from the Mediterranean through the Middle East and the Himalayas to Indonesia, covering a distance of more than 15,000 kilometers (9,300 miles)[3].

The difference in seismic activity between these two belts is significant, with the Circum-Pacific belt experiencing nearly five times more major earthquakes than the Alpide belt.
