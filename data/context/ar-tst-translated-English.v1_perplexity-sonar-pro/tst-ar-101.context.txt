Simón Bolívar was the first president of Gran Colombia, serving from 1819 to 1830[1][3]. Bolívar, a Venezuelan military and political leader, played a crucial role in the Latin American independence movements against Spanish rule in the early 19th century.

After his victory against Spanish forces in New Granada (present-day Colombia) at the Battle of Boyacá in 1819, Bolívar participated in the foundation of Gran Colombia[1]. This new state encompassed the territories of present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama[2]. The Congress of Angostura in 1819 elected Bolívar as the first president of Gran Colombia, with Francisco Antonio Zea as vice president[2].

Gran Colombia was formally established by the Congress of Cúcuta in 1821, which drafted the Constitution of Cúcuta and reaffirmed Bolívar's position as president[4]. The capital was set in Bogotá, and Francisco de Paula Santander was elected as vice president[4].

During his presidency, Bolívar continued his military campaigns to liberate other parts of South America from Spanish rule. He was often absent from Gran Colombia in the early years of its existence, leaving much of the executive power to be exercised by the vice president[7].

Bolívar's vision was to create a strong, unified Spanish America that could resist threats from Spain, the European Holy Alliance, and the emerging power of the United States[1]. However, despite his efforts, Gran Colombia faced significant political instability and regional tensions. These challenges ultimately led to the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830, the same year Bolívar resigned from the presidency[1][3].
