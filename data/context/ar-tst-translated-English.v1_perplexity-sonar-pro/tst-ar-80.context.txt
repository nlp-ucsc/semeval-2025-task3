The title of the memoirs written by Carlo Gozzi to defend himself after the scandal caused by the play "Love's Potions" is "The Memoirs of Count Carlo Gozzi"[1][2]. This autobiographical work was written in the late 18th century and provides insights into Gozzi's life, experiences, and the cultural landscape of Venice during that time[2].

The memoirs were translated into English by John Addington Symonds and published in two volumes[1][4]. The full title of the English translation is "The Memoirs of Count Carlo Gozzi, translated into English by John Addington Symonds, with essays on Italian impromptu comedy, Gozzi's life, the dramatic fables, and Pietro Longhi, by the translator"[1][3].

In these memoirs, Gozzi introduces himself and provides context for his writing. He describes his family background and social standing as a member of the Venetian nobility, though without true patrician roots[2]. The narrative focuses on various aspects of his life, including:

1. His interactions with other prominent playwrights and social figures of his time
2. Reflections on Venetian society during its period of decline
3. His literary endeavors and contributions to Venetian literature
4. His involvement with the Commedia dell'Arte

Notably, the memoirs detail a specific episode involving a conflict with Pier Antonio Gratarol, a secretary in the Venetian government[2]. This conflict likely relates to the scandal caused by the play "Love's Potions," which prompted Gozzi to write these memoirs as a form of self-defense.

The memoirs offer a blend of personal anecdotes, cultural observations, and reflections on Gozzi's combative relationships with his contemporaries, providing a unique perspective on the literary and social life of 18th-century Venice[2].
