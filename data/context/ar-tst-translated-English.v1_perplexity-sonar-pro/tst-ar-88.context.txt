During the Danish Golden Age, which spanned approximately from 1800 to 1850, Denmark saw significant developments in architecture, particularly in the Neoclassical style. This period was characterized by a focus on clean, simple forms and a return to classical Greek and Roman architectural principles. Here are the key architectural styles and developments during this era:

## Neoclassicism

Neoclassicism was the dominant architectural style during the Danish Golden Age. It was characterized by:

1. Clean, simple forms and large, unbroken surfaces[1][2]
2. Inspiration from ancient Greek and Roman architecture[1][2]
3. Use of columns, pediments, and other classical elements[1]

The main proponent of this style was Christian Frederik Hansen, often referred to as the "Father of Danish Classicism." His work exemplified the severe and monumental aspects of Neoclassicism[1][2].

## Key Neoclassical Buildings

Several important Neoclassical buildings were constructed during this period:

1. Copenhagen City Hall & Courthouse (1805-1815): Designed by Christian Frederik Hansen, this building showcases the clean lines and simple forms typical of Danish Neoclassicism[1][2].

2. Church of Our Lady (Vor Frue Kirke) (1811-1829): Also designed by Hansen, this church and its surrounding square demonstrate the Neoclassical style applied to religious architecture[1][2].

3. Christiansborg Palace Chapel: While the palace itself burned down, the chapel remains as an example of Hansen's Neoclassical work, featuring Ionic columns and a sense of antiquity[1].

## Urban Planning and Renovation

The Golden Age also saw significant urban development in Copenhagen:

1. Repair and rebuilding: Much of Copenhagen was rebuilt in the Neoclassical style following fires in 1795 and the British bombardment in 1807[2].

2. New city layout: The period saw the development of wider, straighter streets and new squares, reflecting Neoclassical urban planning principles[2][8].

## Influence of Earlier Styles

While Neoclassicism was dominant, elements from earlier architectural periods still had some influence:

1. Late Baroque and Rococo: Some buildings, particularly from the early part of the Golden Age, still showed influences from these earlier styles[4].

2. Danish National Romantic style: Towards the end of the Golden Age, there was a shift towards more nationalistic architectural expressions, which would fully develop in the latter half of the 19th century[5].

The architecture of the Danish Golden Age, particularly its Neoclassical expressions, reflected the broader cultural and artistic flourishing of the period. It emphasized simplicity, functionality, and a connection to classical ideals, which would continue to influence Danish design and architecture in the centuries to come.
