Messi began his football journey in his hometown of Rosario, joining local club Newell's Old Boys at the age of 8[5][7]. Despite being diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency as a child, Messi's exceptional talent was evident from an early age[5][7].

At 13 years old, Messi moved to Barcelona, Spain to join FC Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia[4][5]. This move was pivotal, as Barcelona agreed to pay for his growth hormone treatment[2][5].
