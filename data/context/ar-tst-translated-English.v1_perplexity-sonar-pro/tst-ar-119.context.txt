Gogebic County does not share a border with any province to the north. Instead, it has a shoreline on Lake Superior to the north[1][5]. The counties and states that border Gogebic County are:

1. To the north: Lake Superior shoreline
2. To the northeast: Ontonagon County, Michigan (in the Eastern Time Zone)[1][5]
3. To the east: Iron County, Michigan (in the Central Time Zone)[1][5]
4. To the south: Vilas County, Wisconsin[1][5]
5. To the southwest: Iron County, Wisconsin[1][5]
6. To the northwest: Ashland County, Wisconsin[1][5]

Gogebic County is the westernmost county in Michigan's Upper Peninsula and is one of four Michigan counties within the Central Time Zone[1]. It's important to note that while there is no province to the north, the Canadian province of Ontario is located across Lake Superior, though it does not directly border Gogebic County.
