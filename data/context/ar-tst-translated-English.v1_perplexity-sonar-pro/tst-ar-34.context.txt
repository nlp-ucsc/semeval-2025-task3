Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic Games, is widely credited with inventing the modern pentathlon[1][2][4]. He introduced this event at the 5th Olympiad in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1912[1].

Coubertin's vision for the modern pentathlon was to create a competition that would test a wide range of athletic skills, simulating the experiences of a 19th-century cavalry soldier behind enemy lines[2]. He believed that this event, more than any other, would test "a man's moral qualities as much as his physical resources and skills, producing thereby the ideal, complete athlete"[1].

The five disciplines Coubertin chose for the modern pentathlon were:

1. Pistol shooting
2. Fencing
3. Swimming
4. Horse riding
5. Running

These events were selected to reflect the skills a soldier might need: the ability to shoot accurately, defend oneself with a sword, cross water obstacles, ride an unfamiliar horse, and run to deliver messages or return to friendly territory[2][4].

It's worth noting that there is some debate about the creation of the modern pentathlon. Researcher Sandra Heck has suggested that Viktor Balck, the President of the Organizing Committee for the 1912 Games, may have played a significant role in shaping the event, drawing on the tradition of Swedish military multi-sports events[2]. However, the majority of sources attribute the invention to Coubertin.

The modern pentathlon has evolved significantly since its inception, with changes in format, scoring, and even the replacement of some disciplines. Most recently, the equestrian event is set to be replaced by an obstacle course for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, marking a significant shift in the sport's history[6][7].
