Andrei Kravchuk studied at two universities:

1. Leningrad State University (now Saint Petersburg State University): He graduated cum laude in 1984 with a degree in mathematics and mechanics[3].

2. Saint Petersburg State Institute of Film and Television: After deciding to pursue filmmaking, Kravchuk was admitted to this institute to study film directing[6].

Kravchuk's educational journey is interesting because he initially pursued mathematics before transitioning to filmmaking. He had almost completed his master's thesis in mathematics when he encountered filmmakers Aleksei German and Vladimir Vengerov. This meeting led to a job as an assistant director, which ultimately inspired Kravchuk to change his career path[6]. 

It's worth noting that Kravchuk's background in mathematics and his later transition to film directing demonstrates a unique combination of analytical and creative skills. This diverse educational background likely contributed to his distinctive approach to filmmaking, as seen in his successful films like "The Italian" (2005) and "Admiral" (2008)[6][10].
