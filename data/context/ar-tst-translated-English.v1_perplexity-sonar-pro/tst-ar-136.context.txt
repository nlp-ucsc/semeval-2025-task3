The Second Council of Nicaea was held in 787 AD[1][3][4]. This ecumenical council, also known as the Seventh Ecumenical Council, was convened to address the issue of iconoclasm and restore the veneration of icons in the Christian Church[1][3].

Some key details about the Second Council of Nicaea include:

1. Date and location: The council opened on September 24, 787, in Nicaea (present-day Ä°znik, Turkey)[1][2].

2. Attendance: Between 258 and 335 bishops were present, with a total of about 350 members, including two papal legates[1][3].

3. Convocation: It was convened by Emperor Constantine VI and his mother, Empress Irene, who acted as regent[1][3].

4. Presiding officials: The council was presided over by Patriarch Tarasios of Constantinople, along with legates of Pope Adrian I[1][3].

5. Purpose: The main purpose was to discuss and resolve the use of icons, which had been condemned by the earlier Council of Hieria in 754[2][3].

6. Outcome: The council approved the veneration of icons, effectively ending the first period of iconoclasm in the Byzantine Empire[3][9].

The Second Council of Nicaea is significant as it is recognized as the last of the first seven ecumenical councils by both the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church[1][3]. It plays an important role in the history of Christian theology and church practice, particularly regarding the use of religious imagery in worship.
