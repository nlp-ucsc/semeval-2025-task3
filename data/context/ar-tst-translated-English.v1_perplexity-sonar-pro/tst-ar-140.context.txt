Catherine McCormack played the role of Murron MacClannough, William Wallace's beloved, in the 1995 epic historical drama film "Braveheart"[1][3]. Directed by and starring Mel Gibson as William Wallace, the film tells the story of Wallace's leadership in the First War of Scottish Independence against King Edward I of England[1].

In the film, McCormack's character Murron is Wallace's childhood friend who later becomes his wife[1][2]. Their relationship is a crucial element of the story, as it is Murron's execution by English soldiers that sparks Wallace's rebellion against the English occupation[3]. 

The film portrays their romance as a passionate but tragically short-lived one. They marry in secret due to the English law of primae noctis, which allowed English lords to sleep with Scottish brides on their wedding night[1][2]. Shortly after their marriage, Murron is captured and executed by English soldiers, which becomes the catalyst for Wallace's rebellion against English rule[3].

McCormack's performance in "Braveheart" was one of her earliest and most notable film roles[4][5]. The success of the film, which won multiple Academy Awards including Best Picture, helped launch her career in both British and American productions[5].
