Cape Verde participated in the Olympic Games for the first time at the 1996 Summer Olympics held in Atlanta, United States[1][2]. This marked the country's debut on the Olympic stage, with four athletes representing Cape Verde in various sports[2].

The Cape Verdean Olympic Committee was formed in 1989 and received official recognition from the International Olympic Committee in September 1993 at the IOC session in Monte Carlo[7]. This paved the way for Cape Verde's participation in the Olympics three years later.

At the 1996 Atlanta Games, Cape Verde sent a delegation of four athletes:

1. Alfayaya Embalo - Men's 100 meters
2. Henry Andrade - Men's 110 meters hurdles
3. António Zeferino - Men's Marathon
4. Isménia do Frederico - Women's 100 meters[2]

Of these athletes, António Zeferino achieved the highest placement, finishing 94th in the marathon[2]. This inaugural participation marked the beginning of Cape Verde's consistent presence at the Summer Olympic Games, as the country has sent athletes to every Summer Olympics since then[5].

It's worth noting that prior to 1996, Cape Verde was unable to participate in the Olympics for various reasons:

- From 1912 to 1972, Cape Verde was occupied by Portugal[5].
- From 1976 to 1992, Cape Verde did not participate in the Olympic Games[5].

Since their debut in 1996, Cape Verde has gradually increased its Olympic presence. In the most recent Olympics (Paris 2024), Cape Verde sent seven athletes and achieved a significant milestone by winning its first-ever Olympic medal when boxer Daniel Varela de Pina secured a bronze in the Men's 51 kg category[3].
