The official languages in Formentera Island are Catalan and Spanish[1][4][5]. 

Catalan is the primary official language of the Balearic Islands, including Formentera. On the island, a specific dialect of Catalan called "formenterenc" or "pag√®s" is commonly spoken by the local population[2][3]. This dialect is a unique variant of Catalan that has developed on the island over time.

Spanish (Castilian) is also an official language and is widely spoken by everyone on the island[2][3]. It serves as a common language for communication, especially in official and formal contexts.

While these are the official languages, it's worth noting that due to Formentera's popularity as a tourist destination, other languages are also commonly used in tourist areas:

1. English is widely spoken in tourist facilities, hotels, and restaurants[1][5].
2. Italian is very common, as many tourists come from Italy[2].
3. German and French are also frequently used in tourist-oriented businesses[1].

This multilingual environment reflects Formentera's international appeal and its reliance on tourism as a major part of its economy. However, for official purposes and among the local population, Catalan (particularly the formenterenc dialect) and Spanish remain the primary languages of communication.
