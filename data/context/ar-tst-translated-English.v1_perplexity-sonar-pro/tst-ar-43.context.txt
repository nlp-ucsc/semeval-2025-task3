Denis Polyakov primarily plays as a defender, specifically in the centre-back position[1][3]. However, he is versatile and can occupy multiple defensive roles:

1. Centre-back: This is his main position, where he plays in the heart of the defense[1][3].

2. Defensive midfielder: He has also been deployed in a more advanced defensive role[3].

3. Full-back: Polyakov has the ability to play as a full-back, covering both the right and left sides of the defense[10].

His versatility is further evidenced by some sources listing him as a central midfielder[8], though this appears to be less common.

Polyakov's physical attributes support his defensive roles:

- Height: He stands at 186 cm (6'1")[1], which is beneficial for aerial duels and set-piece situations.
- Weight: His weight is reported as 80 kg (176 lbs)[1], providing a good balance of strength and agility for defensive duties.

As a defender, Polyakov's primary responsibilities include:

- Blocking shots
- Tackling opponents
- Intercepting passes
- Contesting headers
- Marking forwards

These tasks are typical for centre-backs, who aim to prevent the opposition from scoring and protect the area directly in front of their own goal[4].
