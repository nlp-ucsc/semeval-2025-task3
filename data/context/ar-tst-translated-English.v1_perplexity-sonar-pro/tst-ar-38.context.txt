Peter Richard Layard, Baron Layard, was instrumental in founding the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) initiative in England[1][4]. This program, also known as NHS Talking Therapies for anxiety and depression, aims to increase the provision of evidence-based psychological treatments for common mental health conditions within the National Health Service[1].

The IAPT initiative was developed and introduced by the Labour Party based on economic evaluations by Layard and new therapy guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, as promoted by clinical psychologist David M. Clark[1]. The program was officially announced in 2007 on World Mental Health Day[1].

Key aspects of the IAPT initiative include:

1. Increasing access to evidence-based treatments for anxiety and depression in primary care settings[1].

2. Implementing a 'stepped care' or triage model, offering 'low intensity' interventions or self-help to most people initially, and 'high intensity' interventions for more serious or complex conditions[1].

3. Assessing outcomes using standardized questionnaires to measure recovery rates[1].

4. Workforce planning to train an adequate number of mental health professionals to deliver these services[1].

Layard's work on mental health, including the publication of The Depression Report in 2006, was crucial in establishing the IAPT program[4]. The initiative has since expanded significantly, now treating over 700,000 people annually in England, with about half recovering within an average of 8 treatment sessions[4]. The program's success has led to its replication in five other countries[4].
