The museum located at the University of Haifa is the Reuben and Edith Hecht Museum[1][3]. Established in 1984, the Hecht Museum is housed in the main building of the University of Haifa and displays both archaeological finds and works of art[3].

The museum was founded by Dr. Reuben Hecht, who was a director of Dagon Silos and a founding member of the University of Haifa Board of Governors[1]. For about 60 years, Hecht collected archaeological artifacts representing the material culture of the Land of Israel in ancient times, particularly focusing on finds from the Canaanite period to the end of the Byzantine period[1][3].

Key features of the Hecht Museum include:

1. Archaeological exhibits: The museum displays artifacts in chronological sequence, from the Chalcolithic period to the Byzantine period. These include coins, weights, Semitic seals, jewelry, and artifacts from the Temple Mount excavations[1].

2. Ma'agan Michael Ship: One of the museum's highlights is the wreck of a fifth-century BCE merchantman, known as the Ma'agan Michael Ship[1][3].

3. Art collection: The museum houses a collection of French paintings from the Barbizon School, Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, and the School of Paris. It also features Jewish art from the mid-nineteenth to early twentieth century, including works by artists such as Manet, Monet, Pissarro, Van Gogh, and Modigliani[1][3].

4. Educational activities: The museum serves as a study center for students and researchers, offering enrichment studies in archaeology, art, Bible, and history[1].

5. Annual art competition: The museum holds a yearly art competition for high-school students, soldiers, and fine arts students, with winners receiving scholarships from the Hecht Foundation[1].

The Hecht Museum is open to the public and offers free admission[5][7]. It provides a unique opportunity to explore both the archaeological history of Israel and significant works of art in one location on the University of Haifa campus.
