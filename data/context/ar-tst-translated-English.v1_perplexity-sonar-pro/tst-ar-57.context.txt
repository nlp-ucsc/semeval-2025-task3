The Pontifical Gregorian University was founded by Saint Ignatius of Loyola in 1551[1][2][3]. Ignatius, the founder of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), established the university as a "School of Grammar, Humanities and Christian Doctrine" in Rome[1][3]. 

Initially, the institution was known as the Roman College (Collegio Romano)[1]. It began in a small building at the base of the Capitoline Hill, with financial support from Francis Borgia, the viceroy of Catalonia[1].

The university's development was significantly influenced by Pope Gregory XIII, who is considered its "founder and protector"[1][3]. In 1584, Gregory XIII provided a new, larger building for the rapidly growing institution, which was then renamed the Gregorian University in his honor[1][4].

It's important to note that while Ignatius of Loyola laid the foundations, the university's growth and official status evolved over time:

1. In 1556, Pope Paul IV authorized the Roman College to confer academic degrees in theology and philosophy, elevating it to university status[1].

2. In 1873, Pope Pius IX officially changed the name to Pontifical Gregorian University[3][4].

3. In 1930, the university moved to its current location near Quirinal Hill, in a new campus inaugurated by Pope Pius XI[1].

Today, the Pontifical Gregorian University continues its mission as a prestigious institution of higher learning for the Roman Catholic clergy and others, maintaining its strong Jesuit tradition[2].
