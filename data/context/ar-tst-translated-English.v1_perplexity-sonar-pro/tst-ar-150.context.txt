Hassan Rouhani won the 2013 Iranian presidential election[1]. He was elected in the first round with over 50% of the vote, receiving 18,613,329 votes which accounted for 52.49% of the total votes cast[1]. 

Key details about Rouhani's victory:

- The election was held on June 14, 2013[1].
- Rouhani narrowly avoided a runoff by securing just over 50% of the votes[1].
- He was considered the most moderate candidate among those permitted to run[3].
- Voter turnout was high at 72.94%, with 36,821,538 out of 50,483,192 eligible voters participating[5].

The runner-up was Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, who received 6,077,292 votes (17.14% of the total)[1][5]. Other notable candidates included Saeed Jalili (11.76%) and Mohsen Rezaee (10.95%)[1].

Rouhani's victory was seen as surprising by some analysts, given that moderates and reformists had been largely purged from the Iranian political system in the preceding decade[3]. His election represented a shift from the more hardline stance of his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, potentially signaling a change in Iran's domestic and foreign policy approach[3].
