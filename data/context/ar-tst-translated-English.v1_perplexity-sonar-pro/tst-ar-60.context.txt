The Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK) is a Kurdish political and militant group that primarily aims to promote Kurdish autonomy and rights, particularly in Iran. Its main goals include:

1. Advocating for the autonomy and rights of Kurdish people, especially in Kurdish-inhabited areas of Iran[1][4].

2. Establishing a secular and democratic political system in Iran[1][7].

3. Promoting greater gender equality and women's rights[1][7].

4. Transforming the Islamic regime in Iran into a more democratic form of government[4][7].

5. Developing a democratic confederal system for Kurds and Iranians[4].

The PJAK seeks to achieve these goals through both political and military means. The group has a political wing that engages in advocacy and a military wing known as the East Kurdistan Defense Forces (YRK), which operates mainly in Iran[1][7]. While the PJAK's ultimate objective has evolved over time, it consistently focuses on advancing Kurdish interests and challenging the current Iranian government structure.

It's important to note that the PJAK is considered an affiliate of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and is part of the broader Kurdistan Communities Union (KCK)[4]. This association has led to the PJAK being designated as a terrorist organization by several countries, including the United States, Iran, and Turkey[3].
