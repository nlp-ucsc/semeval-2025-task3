The epicenter of the 1994 Northridge earthquake was located in the San Fernando Valley, specifically in the Reseda neighborhood of Los Angeles, California[1][5]. More precisely:

1. It was near the intersection of Reseda Boulevard and Arminta Street in the northwest San Fernando Valley[5].

2. The epicenter's geographical coordinates were 34°12'47"N 118°32'13"W[1].

3. It was approximately 20 miles (32 km) west-northwest of downtown Los Angeles[3][7].

4. The epicenter was about 1 mile south-southwest of Northridge[7].

5. One resident, Joe Sauer, who lived near the corner of Elkwood Street and Baird Avenue off Reseda Boulevard, reported that the epicenter was essentially in his backyard[2].

6. Another source specifically states that the epicenter was located at the end of Elkwood Street, just east of Baird Avenue, in Reseda – less than one mile from Northridge Hospital[10].

The earthquake occurred on a previously undiscovered blind thrust fault at a depth of about 11.31 miles (18.20 km)[1]. It's worth noting that while the earthquake is named after Northridge, the actual epicenter was slightly southwest in Reseda. The naming likely came from the significant damage observed in Northridge, particularly at California State University, Northridge[8].
