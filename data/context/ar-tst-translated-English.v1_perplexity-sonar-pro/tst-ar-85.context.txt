Aloys Fleischmann specialized in music at University College Cork, where he held the position of Professor of Music from 1934 until his retirement in 1980[1][4][7]. He was appointed to the Chair of Music at the remarkably young age of 24, becoming one of the youngest professors in the history of the National University[7].

As Professor of Music, Fleischmann's work encompassed several key areas:

1. Music Education: He focused on developing well-rounded music graduates capable of various musical skills, including conducting, accompanying, scoring, and composition[4].

2. Composition: Fleischmann composed numerous works, including large-scale pieces for chorus and orchestra, ballets, symphonies, song cycles, and chamber music[1][7].

3. Conducting: He founded and conducted the Cork Symphony Orchestra for 58 seasons[4].

4. Musicology: Fleischmann engaged in extensive research on Irish traditional music, culminating in his magnum opus "Sources of Irish Traditional Music c.1600-1855"[4][7].

5. Cultural Promotion: He established several important musical institutions, including the Cork International Choral and Folk Dance Festival in 1954[1][4].

Throughout his tenure, Fleischmann worked tirelessly to improve the state of music education and performance in Ireland, believing that music could only flourish through a body of well-trained teachers and active community engagement[4][7].
