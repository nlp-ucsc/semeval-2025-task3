La Palme is located in the south of France, in the Languedoc-Roussillon region (now part of the larger Occitanie region) within the department of Aude[1][5]. Specifically:

- It is situated in the southeastern part of the Aude department[5].
- La Palme is part of the Narbonnais area, which includes Narbonne and its surroundings, the Clape massif, and the lagoon strip of ponds[5].
- The village is built on the edge of the La Palme pond, between the national road 9 and departmental road 709[5].
- It is positioned between the cities of Narbonne and Perpignan[5].
- La Palme is approximately 3 km from the Mediterranean Sea, 26 km from Narbonne, 34 km from Perpignan, and 80 km from the Spanish border[1].

The commune is part of the Grand Narbonne intercommunality and is included in the Narbonnaise en Méditerranée Regional Natural Park[5][7]. This location gives La Palme a distinct Mediterranean climate and places it in an area rich in natural heritage, with several protected natural sites and Natura 2000 zones in its vicinity[5].
