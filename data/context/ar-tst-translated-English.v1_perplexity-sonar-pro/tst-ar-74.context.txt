In Japan, the NES Classic Edition is known as the Nintendo Classic Mini: Family Computer, or more commonly referred to as the Classic Mini Famicom[1][4]. This version is designed to resemble the original Famicom (Family Computer) console, which was the Japanese counterpart to the NES[2].

The Classic Mini Famicom was released alongside the NES Classic Edition in other regions, but with some notable differences:

1. Appearance: It features the iconic red and white color scheme of the original Famicom, as opposed to the gray design of the NES[6].

2. Controllers: The Classic Mini Famicom's controllers are hardwired into the console, mimicking the original Famicom design. They are also smaller in proportion to the miniaturized console[1].

3. Game library: While many games are shared between the NES Classic Edition and the Classic Mini Famicom, there are some differences in the included titles. The Famicom version has some Japan-exclusive games that were not included in the NES Classic Edition[3][6].

4. Interface language: The Classic Mini Famicom's interface is only in Japanese, whereas the NES Classic Edition supports multiple languages[1].

The release of the Classic Mini Famicom in Japan alongside the NES Classic Edition in other regions demonstrates Nintendo's attention to regional nostalgia and the historical differences between their console releases in various markets.
