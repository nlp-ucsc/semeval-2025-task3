Ernest Cole was a renowned South African photographer and photojournalist who specialized in documenting the harsh realities of apartheid in South Africa during the 1960s[1][2][3]. His field of specialization can be described as social documentary photography, with a particular focus on exposing racial injustice and inequality.

Cole's most significant work was his photobook "House of Bondage," published in 1967, which provided a stark and powerful visual account of life under apartheid[1][2]. This groundbreaking work established Cole as one of the most important photographers of the 20th century, offering an insider's perspective on the oppressive system[2].

Key aspects of Cole's photographic specialization include:

1. Black life under apartheid: Cole extensively documented the daily experiences of Black South Africans, capturing the systemic discrimination and hardships they faced[3].

2. Urban and rural documentation: His work spanned both urban settings, particularly in Johannesburg, and rural areas of South Africa[2][3].

3. Social and political commentary: Through his images, Cole provided a critical visual commentary on the political and social structures of apartheid South Africa[1][2].

4. Photojournalism: Cole worked as a freelance photographer for publications like Drum magazine, the Rand Daily Mail, and the Sunday Express, making him South Africa's first Black freelance photographer[4].

5. Street photography: After moving to the United States, Cole applied his observational skills to street scenes, particularly in New York City[1][2].

6. African American life: In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Cole received a grant from the Ford Foundation to document Black communities in both rural and urban areas of the United States[1][2].

Cole's approach was characterized by his ability to capture intimate, evocative moments that revealed the human impact of racial segregation and discrimination. His work combined artistic sensitivity with a strong sense of social justice, making him a pioneer in using photography as a tool for exposing and combating systemic racism[1][2][3].
