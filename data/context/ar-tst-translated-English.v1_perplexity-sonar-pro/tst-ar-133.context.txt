Based on the search results provided, there are multiple Helsinki clubs mentioned, so I'll provide information on the founders of the most prominent ones:

1. The Helsinki Finnish Club (Helsingin Suomalainen Klubi):
The Helsinki Finnish Club was founded by Fredrik Wathén in 1876[1][6]. The club was initially established as "Luku- ja Konversationi-klubbi Helsingissä" (The Reading and Conversational Club in Helsinki), and its rules were ratified in the Senate on April 25th, 1876, which is considered the official birthday of the club[1].

2. Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi (HJK Helsinki):
HJK Helsinki, which is a prominent football club in Finland, was founded by Fredrik Wathén on June 19, 1907[2]. The founding meeting was held at a bowling alley in Kaisaniemi Park in May of that year.

3. Helsinki Rugby Club (HRC):
The search results don't provide information about the specific founder of the Helsinki Rugby Club. However, it is mentioned that the club was founded in 1999 and is the oldest and biggest rugby club in Finland[4].

4. Helsinki Camera Club:
While not explicitly called "Helsinki Club," the Helsinki Camera Club, originally named "Amateur Photographers of Helsinki" (Helsingin Amatööri-Valokuvaajat), was founded on March 2nd, 1921. The search results mention that there were 14 founding members, all male, but don't specify a single founder[7].

It's worth noting that Fredrik Wathén appears to be a significant figure in Helsinki's club history, having founded both the Helsinki Finnish Club and HJK Helsinki, two of the most prominent clubs mentioned in the search results.
