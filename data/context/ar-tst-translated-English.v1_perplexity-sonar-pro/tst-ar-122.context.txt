Three passengers died in the Air France Flight 296 accident[1][3]. The crash occurred during an air show at Habsheim, Alsace, France on June 26, 1988. While all 136 passengers initially survived the impact, three people subsequently died due to smoke inhalation from the fire that broke out after the crash[3].

The victims were:

1. A 14-year-old quadriplegic boy named Hervé Liermann, who was seated in 4F and unable to move[3].

2. A 7-year-old girl named Mariama Barry, seated in 8C, who became trapped when she was unable to remove her seatbelt after a seatback collapsed on top of her[3].

3. An adult woman named Marie-Françoise Froesch, who had initially reached the front door but then returned to try to help the 7-year-old girl[3].

The tragedy unfolded as the Airbus A320 performed a low-altitude flyover during the air show. The aircraft descended lower than intended, striking trees at the end of the runway before crashing and bursting into flames[1][2]. While most passengers were able to evacuate, the intense fire and smoke ultimately led to these three fatalities.

This accident was particularly significant as it was the first fatal crash involving an Airbus A320, which at the time was a new and technologically advanced aircraft[1][3].
