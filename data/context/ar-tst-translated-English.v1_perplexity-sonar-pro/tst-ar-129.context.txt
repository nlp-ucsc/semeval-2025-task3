Bahram I ruled as king of Persia for a short period from 273 to 276 CE[1][3]. He was a member of the Sasanian dynasty and succeeded his brother Hormizd I[1]. 

Some key points about Bahram I's reign:

- He came to power in 273 CE after the brief one-year reign of his brother Hormizd I[1].

- His reign lasted approximately 3 years, ending in 276 CE when he was succeeded by his son Bahram II[1][3].

- During his short rule, Bahram I strengthened the position of the Zoroastrian clergy and their high priest Kartir[3].

- At the insistence of the Zoroastrian clergy, Bahram I had Mani, the founder of Manichaeism, imprisoned. This led to religious persecution against Manichaeans, Christians, and Buddhists[3].

- There is a rock sculpture at Bishāpūr in southern Iran depicting Bahram I with his characteristic radiate crown, though his name in the inscription was later erased by the Sasanian king Narses[3].

While Bahram I's reign was brief, it marked an important shift towards increased power for the Zoroastrian priesthood in the Sasanian Empire. His actions against Mani and other religious minorities set the stage for further religious conflicts in the following years.
