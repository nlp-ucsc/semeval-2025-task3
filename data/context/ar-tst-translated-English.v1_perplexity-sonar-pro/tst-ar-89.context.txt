The primary source of funding for the construction of the new Groninger Museum was Gasunie, the Dutch national natural gas utility company. Specifically:

The museum was mainly funded by Gasunie as a gift to the city of Groningen to celebrate the company's 25th anniversary[1][4]. Gasunie agreed to the proposal for a new museum building suggested by museum director Frans Haks and granted 25 million guilders (Dutch currency at the time) for the project[4].

Some additional details about the funding and construction:

- The total construction costs were projected to be around €71 million for a related cultural center project called Forum Groningen, of which €35 million was paid by the provincial government[2]. However, this seems to be for a separate but related project, not the Groninger Museum itself.

- The museum director Frans Haks wanted to move out of the old, insufficient exhibition space and suggested the new museum building when Gasunie was looking to give the city a present[1][4].

- Despite some controversy and protests that temporarily halted construction, building resumed in 1992 and was completed in 1994[1][4].

- The museum opened in its new building in 1994, which caused a sensation and helped establish it as one of the finest museums in the Netherlands[1].

So in summary, while there may have been some additional funding sources, the primary and initial major funding came from Gasunie as a 25 million guilder gift to celebrate their anniversary and provide a new home for the museum.
