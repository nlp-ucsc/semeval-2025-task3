Pentastomida refers to a group of parasitic arthropods commonly known as tongue worms[1]. The name "Pentastomida" comes from the Greek words "pente" meaning five and "stoma" meaning mouth, due to the five protuberances found on the anterior end of these organisms - four of which are clawed legs, while the fifth bears the actual mouth[1][7].

Key points about Pentastomida:

1. Classification: They are now considered to be highly-derived crustaceans, specifically placed within the subphylum Crustacea and class Maxillopoda[1][2].

2. Anatomy: Pentastomids are worm-like animals ranging from 1 to 14 centimeters in length. They have a segmented body covered in a chitinous cuticle[1].

3. Parasitic lifestyle: All known species of Pentastomida are obligate parasites, meaning they cannot complete their life cycle without a host[4].

4. Habitat: As adults, they primarily inhabit the respiratory tract (lungs and nasal passages) of vertebrates, particularly reptiles[1][4].

5. Life cycle: Their life cycle typically involves an intermediate host (often a fish or small herbivorous mammal) and a definitive host (usually a reptile, bird, or mammal)[1].

6. Diversity: There are about 130 known species of pentastomids, including some extinct species from the Paleozoic Era[1][4].

7. Medical significance: Some pentastomids can cause zoonotic infections in humans, resulting in conditions such as visceral and respiratory pentastomiasis[4].

The term "Pentastomida" thus encompasses a unique group of parasitic organisms with distinctive anatomical and ecological characteristics, reflecting their specialized evolutionary adaptations to an endoparasitic lifestyle.
