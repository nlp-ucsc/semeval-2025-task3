Domantas Sabonis started his professional basketball career in 2012 with Unicaja Málaga in Spain[1]. Specifically:

- On September 5, 2012, at just 16 years old, Sabonis made his debut for Unicaja Málaga against Cibona Zagreb[1].

- For the 2012-13 season, he was loaned to Clínicas Rincón[1].

- He returned to Unicaja Málaga for the 2013-14 season[1].

- On October 13, 2013, at 17 years, 5 months, and 10 days old, Sabonis debuted in the Liga ACB (the top Spanish basketball league), becoming the youngest Unicaja player to do so[1].

- On October 18, 2013, he made his EuroLeague debut against Olympiacos Piraeus[1].

It's worth noting that during his time with Unicaja, Sabonis did not sign a professional contract with a salary in order to maintain his NCAA eligibility[1]. He played for Unicaja from 2012 to 2014 before moving to the United States to play college basketball for Gonzaga University[1].
