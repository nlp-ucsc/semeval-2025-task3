The life of the German light cruiser SMS Emden came to an end during the Battle of Cocos on November 9, 1914. Here's a detailed account of its final moments:

The Emden, under the command of Karl von Müller, had been conducting a highly successful commerce raiding campaign in the Indian Ocean for several months. On the morning of November 9, the ship arrived at the Cocos (Keeling) Islands with the intention of destroying a British wireless station[5].

At around 06:00, Emden sent a landing party ashore to disable the wireless station on Direction Island. However, the station managed to transmit a distress call before being shut down. This call was intercepted by the Australian light cruiser HMAS Sydney, which was escorting a nearby convoy[5].

Sydney arrived off Direction Island at 09:15, spotting Emden. Both ships prepared for combat. At 09:40, Emden opened fire, surprising the Sydney crew with its long-range capability. Despite scoring several early hits, Emden was unable to inflict disabling damage on the larger and more powerful Australian cruiser[5].

As the battle progressed, Sydney's superior firepower began to tell. Emden suffered heavy damage:
- Her steering gear was destroyed
- Rangefinders were knocked out
- Several guns were put out of action
- The forward funnel collapsed overboard
- The foremast fell and crushed the fore-bridge
- A shell from Sydney landed in Emden's aft ammunition room, forcing the Germans to flood it[5]

After about one and a half hours of fighting, with Emden heavily damaged and unable to effectively return fire, von Müller made the decision to beach the ship on North Keeling Island to prevent it from sinking and to save as many of his crew as possible[5].

Sydney initially broke off to pursue Emden's collier, Buresk, which scuttled itself. The Australian ship then returned to North Keeling Island at 16:00. Seeing Emden's battle ensign still flying, Sydney signaled asking if the German ship surrendered. After some confusion and no clear response, Sydney fired two more salvoes into the wrecked Emden, killing 20 German personnel[5].

Finally, the German ensign was lowered and burned, and a white sheet was raised as a flag of surrender. During the battle, 130 personnel aboard Emden were killed, and 69 were wounded, four of whom later died[5].

The Emden remained stuck on the reef where it had been beached until the 1950s when a Japanese salvage company removed what was left of the hull[4].

This battle marked the end of Emden's remarkable 94-day career as a commerce raider, during which it had captured or destroyed about 30 enemy merchant ships and two warships, causing significant disruption to Allied shipping in the Indian Ocean[2].
