The World Taekwondo Championship is held every two years[2]. This biennial event is organized by World Taekwondo (WT), formerly known as the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF)[1][6].

Some key details about the World Taekwondo Championships:

1. Frequency: It takes place every odd year[3]. For example, recent championships were held in 2023 (Baku, Azerbaijan), 2022 (Guadalajara, Mexico), 2019 (Manchester, Great Britain), and 2017 (Muju, South Korea)[2][4].

2. Significance: It is considered the flagship World Taekwondo competition, attracting hundreds of the world's best athletes from around the globe[4].

3. History: The inaugural World Taekwondo Championship was held in Seoul, South Korea in 1973[8].

4. Venue: The championship is hosted in different cities around the world. For instance, the 2023 edition was held at the Baku Crystal Hall in Azerbaijan[4].

5. Medal dominance: South Korea has been the most successful nation in the World Taekwondo Championships, winning a total of 232 medals as of the information provided[8].

It's worth noting that in Olympic years, the World Taekwondo Grand-Prix Series, which is typically an annual event, is not held[3][5]. This allows for focus on the Olympic taekwondo tournament, which has been part of the Summer Olympics since 2000[6].
