Okay, the user is asking about the musical genre that Maria Grever is famous for. First, I need to confirm who Maria Grever is. She was a Mexican composer and singer, right? I remember she wrote some popular songs, especially in the Latin music scene.

I think she was prominent in the 20th century, maybe around the 1940s to 60s. Her music likely falls under traditional Latin American genres. I should consider what genres were popular during that time. Bolero comes to mind, which is a slow-tempo, romantic genre. Also, ranchera is another possibility since it's a well-known Mexican style.

Wait, does she have any specific famous songs? I believe "Around the World" and "What a Difference a Day Makes" are among her works. These songs are more in the realm of bolero and romantic ballads. Ranchera is more about mariachi and rural themes, which might not fit her style as much.

So, putting it together, Maria Grever's music is mainly associated with bolero and romantic ballads. She contributed significantly to these genres, making her a notable figure in Latin American music history.
