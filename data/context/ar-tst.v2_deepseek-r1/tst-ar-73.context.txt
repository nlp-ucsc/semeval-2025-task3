Okay, the user is asking about Nina Cortex's sports specialty. First, I should recall who Nina Cortex is. She's a character from the Crash Bandicoot series, right? She's Dr. Neo Cortex's niece. But does she have a specific sport she's known for? I don't remember her being associated with any particular sport in the games. She's more of a secondary character, often involved in the storylines but not exactly known for athletics.

Maybe the user is confusing her with another character. Or perhaps in some spin-off media, she's involved in sports? I should check that. But considering the main series, she's typically involved in the main plot, helping her uncle or having her own storylines. She's known for her intelligence and technical skills, not really for sports.

I should make sure I have accurate information. I'll think about the games she's appeared in: Crash Twinsanity, Crash Tag Team Racing, and maybe some others. In those, she's either a damsel in distress or an antagonist, but nothing points to a specific sport. So, it's safe to say that Nina Cortex isn't known for a particular sport specialty. I should inform the user that while she is a notable character, there's no specific sport associated with her in the series. That way, the user gets a clear and accurate answer.
