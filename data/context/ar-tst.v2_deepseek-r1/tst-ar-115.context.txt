الطراد إمدن كان طراداً حربياً في البحرية الإمبراطورية الألمانية!: During World War II, the German cruiser "Emden" was used by the Kriegsmarine, the navy of Nazi Germany. It played a role in the invasion of Denmark and Norway in 1940, and later served in the Baltic Sea.

### إنهاء الخدمة:
In the final stages of the war, on April 9, 1945, the cruiser "Emden" was heavily damaged by British bombers while in port at Gotenhafen (now Gdynia, Poland). The ship was struck by several bombs and caught fire, leading to significant damage.

### الغرق:
Due to the extensive damage sustained during the bombing, the "Emden" was rendered inoperable. The German forces decided to scuttle the ship to prevent it from falling into enemy hands. It was intentionally sunk on May 3, 1945, near the island of Grasören, off the coast of Flensburg, Germany.

### ما بعد الحرب:
After the war, the wreck of the "Emden" was raised and ultimately scrapped in the late 1940s. The cruiser's career ended with its scuttling in 1945, marking the end of its service in the Kriegsmarine.

The "Emden" was one of the many German warships that met their fate during the chaotic final months of World War II.
