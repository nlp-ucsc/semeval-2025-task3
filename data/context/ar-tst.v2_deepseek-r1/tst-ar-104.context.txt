Okay, the user is asking about when Sakata city was officially established. I remember that Sakata is in Japan, specifically in Yamagata prefecture. I think it was in the mid-20th century, possibly during the Shōwa period. Maybe around 1954 or 1955? Let me make sure about the exact year. I recall there was a merger of several towns and villages leading to the establishment of the city. Yes, I believe it was on April 1, 1954. That seems right.
تأسست مدينة ساكاتا رسميًا في 1 أبريل 1954.
