Lucius Munatius Plancus was the consul who founded Lugdunum (modern-day Lyon, France) in 43 BC[1][4][7]. He was a Roman senator who served as consul in 42 BC and censor in 22 BC[7].

The founding of Lugdunum occurred during a tumultuous period following the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC. The Roman Senate ordered Munatius Plancus, who was then serving as the governor of Gaul, to establish a city for a group of Roman refugees who had been expelled from Vienne (about 30 km south of Lyon) by the Allobroges[1][9].

Plancus chose a strategic location at the confluence of the Rhône and Saône rivers to found the new Roman colony[1]. The city was officially named Colonia Copia Felix Munatia Lugudunum, reflecting its status as a Roman colony and honoring its founder[3].

Lugdunum quickly grew in importance, becoming the capital of the Roman province of Gallia Lugdunensis and a major administrative center for several Gallic provinces[3][4]. It also became the site of an important mint that produced coins for the entire Roman Empire[4].

Plancus' role in founding Lugdunum was significant enough that he mentioned it in his funerary inscription, which states that he "founded the colonies of Lugdunum and Raurica in Gaul"[2][7]. In recognition of his contribution to the city's history, a street on Fourvière Hill in modern Lyon was named after Plancus in 2016[9].
