Chancelor Johnathan Bennett is professionally known as Chance the Rapper in the artistic field[1][2][4]. He is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer from Chicago, Illinois[4]. Born on April 16, 1993, Bennett adopted the stage name "Chance the Rapper" early in his career[5][6].

The choice of this stage name has significance for Bennett. In a 2017 interview, he explained that he wanted to embrace and elevate the term "rapper," which he felt was often stigmatized or avoided by artists who preferred to call themselves musicians or vocalists[7]. For Bennett, the title "rapper" is closely associated with Black identity, and he aimed to challenge preconceptions about what a rapper might sound like or be capable of artistically[7].

Bennett began his rap career in high school, releasing his first mixtape "10 Day" in 2012[7]. He gained widespread recognition with his second mixtape "Acid Rap" in 2013[1][2]. Since then, Chance the Rapper has become a prominent figure in the hip-hop industry, known for his unique voice, melodic flows, and incorporation of gospel sounds in his music[3].
