I apologize, but I do not have enough information from the provided search results to determine which hand Keiko Morigami played with. The search results contain very limited information about Keiko Morigami, only mentioning her name and career prize money earnings in passing. They do not provide any details about her playing style or which hand she used. To accurately answer this question, we would need additional sources with more specific information about Keiko Morigami's tennis career and playing characteristics.
