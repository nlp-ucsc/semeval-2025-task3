Athena is the goddess who protected and helped Odysseus throughout his journey in Homer's Odyssey[1][2][3]. As the Greek goddess of wisdom, warfare, and craft, Athena played a crucial role in Odysseus's adventures and his eventual return home to Ithaca[7].

Athena's support for Odysseus manifested in several key ways:

1. Divine intervention: From the beginning of the Odyssey, Athena actively worked to aid Odysseus. She persuaded Zeus to send Hermes to Calypso's island to secure Odysseus's release[5].

2. Guidance and counsel: Athena often appeared to Odysseus, sometimes in disguise, to offer advice and strategic guidance. For example, she advised him to disguise himself as a beggar upon his return to Ithaca[7].

3. Protection: The goddess used her divine powers to protect Odysseus from various dangers. She helped calm seas, smoothed jagged rocks, and even put Odysseus to sleep to help him rest safely[10].

4. Enhancing his appearance: At crucial moments, Athena would use her powers to make Odysseus appear more impressive or attractive, helping him gain favor with others[10].

5. Assistance to his family: Athena also helped Odysseus's son Telemachus and wife Penelope. She guided Telemachus on his own journey and provided reassurance to Penelope through dreams[10].

Athena's support for Odysseus stemmed from her admiration for his cunning and resourcefulness, qualities that aligned with her own domains of wisdom and strategy[7]. As his divine patron, she consistently intervened on his behalf, both in the mortal world and among the gods, playing a crucial role in his eventual successful return home[1][3].
