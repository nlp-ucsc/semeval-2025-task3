I apologize, but there appears to be an error in your query. The word "moog" is not mentioned in the Behistun Inscription or in any of the search results provided about the Behistun Inscription. 

The Behistun Inscription is a famous multilingual inscription carved into a cliff face in Iran, dating back to the reign of Darius I (522-486 BCE)[1][4]. It is written in three cuneiform scripts - Old Persian, Elamite, and Babylonian[2]. The inscription was crucial in deciphering cuneiform scripts, much like how the Rosetta Stone helped decipher Egyptian hieroglyphs[4].

The content of the inscription primarily deals with Darius I's lineage, his claim to the throne, and his military victories[1][4]. It does not contain any reference to a word "moog".

The term "moog" appears in one of the search results[6], but it is unrelated to the Behistun Inscription. In that context, "Moog mountain" is mentioned in relation to Sogdian writing samples found in the Zarafshan valley, which is a completely different historical and geographical context.

If you're interested in the linguistic aspects of the Behistun Inscription, I'd be happy to provide information about the languages used in the inscription or its importance in the field of linguistics and translation. However, for accurate information, we would need to focus on the actual content and languages of the Behistun Inscription rather than unrelated terms.
