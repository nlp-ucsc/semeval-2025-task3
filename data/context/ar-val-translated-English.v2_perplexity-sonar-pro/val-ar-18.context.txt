Hausa is the widely spoken language in Katsina State alongside English, which is the official language of Nigeria[5][6][7]. 

Katsina State, located in the northwestern geopolitical zone of Nigeria, is predominantly inhabited by the Hausa and Fulani ethnic groups[4][5]. While English serves as the official language for government and formal affairs, Hausa is the dominant language used in everyday communication among the local population.

Some key points about languages in Katsina State:

1. Hausa is the most widely spoken indigenous language in the state[4][5].

2. Fulfulde (the language of the Fulani people) is also spoken in Katsina State, though to a lesser extent than Hausa[4].

3. English, as the official language of Nigeria, is used in government, education, and formal settings[6][7].

4. The state government conducts its official business in English, but Hausa is commonly used for local communication and cultural purposes[4][5].

5. Katsina State, like other northern Nigerian states, has a strong Islamic influence, which has contributed to the preservation and widespread use of Hausa in daily life[5].

It's worth noting that while Hausa is the dominant local language, the linguistic landscape of Nigeria as a whole is quite diverse, with over 500 languages spoken across the country[6]. However, in Katsina State, Hausa remains the primary language of communication for the majority of the population, coexisting with English in its role as the official language.
