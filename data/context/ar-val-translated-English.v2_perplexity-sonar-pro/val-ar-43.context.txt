The climate in Brazil differs significantly between the north and south due to the country's vast size and diverse geography[1][2][5].

In the north:

The climate is predominantly tropical, characterized by high temperatures and humidity throughout the year[1][2]. This region includes the Amazon rainforest and experiences an equatorial climate with constant rainfall[3]. Average temperatures in the north range from 25 to 30 degrees Celsius (77 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit)[2]. The Amazon basin has a year-round average temperature of 28-30°C (82-86°F)[6].

Key features of the northern climate:
- Hot and humid conditions persist year-round
- High rainfall, with a pronounced rainy season from December to May in the Amazon[6]
- Little temperature variation between seasons

In contrast, the south:

The climate becomes more subtropical and even temperate in the southernmost states[1][5]. This region experiences more defined seasons and a wider range of temperatures[5]. 

Key features of the southern climate:
- More distinct seasons, with cooler winters and warmer summers
- Average temperatures in the south range from 17 to 19°C (63 to 66°F)[5]
- Winter temperatures can drop significantly, occasionally reaching near freezing in some areas[3]
- Some southern states like Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul may even experience light snowfall in winter[6]

The transition between these climate zones is gradual:

- Central Brazil has a tropical climate with less oceanic influence, resulting in very hot temperatures year-round with occasional winter cooling[3]
- The southeast, including cities like São Paulo, has a climate that falls between tropical and subtropical[4]

It's important to note that elevation also plays a role in temperature variations. Cities at higher altitudes, such as Brasília and Belo Horizonte, experience more moderate temperatures despite their geographical location[5].

This climate diversity allows Brazil to offer a wide range of experiences for travelers, from the constant heat and humidity of the Amazon to the more temperate conditions of the south, where one might need a jacket in winter[6].
