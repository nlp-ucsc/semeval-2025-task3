The Towers of Silence are typically located on elevated terrain, often on hilltops or rocky outcrops. This positioning serves several important purposes:

1. Isolation: The towers are situated on high ground away from populated areas, providing privacy for Zoroastrian burial rituals and keeping the sites separate from human habitation[1][3].

2. Exposure to elements: The elevated locations ensure maximum exposure to sunlight and wind, facilitating natural decomposition processes[6].

3. Prevention of contamination: Placing the towers on hills helps prevent any potential contamination of the surrounding land or water sources[3].

4. Visibility: The hilltop locations make the towers visible from a distance, serving as landmarks for the Zoroastrian community[5].

Specific examples of Tower of Silence locations include:

1. Yazd, Iran: The most well-known Towers of Silence are located about 15 kilometers southeast of Yazd city center, situated on low sedimentary hills called Dakhmeh mountain[3][4][6].

2. Mumbai, India: Towers of Silence can be found in a 55-acre forested area near downtown Mumbai, on Malabar Hill[7][10].

3. Aden, Yemen: A disused Tower of Silence is located in the hills overlooking the Crater neighborhood[7].

4. Khorezm, Uzbekistan: The Chilpik Dakhma, another Tower of Silence, is situated on a large earthen mound with a flattened summit, just north of the Amu Darya River banks[8].

The geographical positioning of these structures reflects the Zoroastrian belief in preserving the purity of the earth and the importance of natural processes in their funerary practices. The elevated, isolated locations ensure that the towers fulfill their intended purpose while minimizing impact on surrounding communities and environments.
