The chemical formula of palmitoleic acid is C16H30O2[1][2].

Palmitoleic acid, also known as (9Z)-hexadec-9-enoic acid, is an omega-7 monounsaturated fatty acid. It is a 16-carbon fatty acid with one double bond located at the 9th carbon atom from the methyl end of the molecule[1]. 

The structural formula can be written as CH3(CH2)5CH=CH(CH2)7COOH, which illustrates:

- 16 carbon atoms (C16)
- 30 hydrogen atoms (H30)
- 2 oxygen atoms (O2)

This fatty acid is commonly found in human adipose tissue and is present in all tissues, with higher concentrations typically found in the liver[1]. It's also found in some plant oils, such as macadamia oil and sea buckthorn oil[1].
