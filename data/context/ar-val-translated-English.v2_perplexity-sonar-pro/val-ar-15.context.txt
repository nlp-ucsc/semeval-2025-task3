Chris Claremont's run on Uncanny X-Men lasted for 16 years, from 1975 to 1991[1][4]. Specifically:

- He began writing the series with issue #94 in 1975[3][4].
- His final issue as the regular writer was Uncanny X-Men #279 in 1991[5].

During this lengthy tenure, Claremont established himself as the definitive X-Men writer and oversaw numerous important developments:

- He co-created many iconic X-Men characters, including Rogue, Psylocke, Kitty Pryde, Mystique, and Gambit[1].
- He wrote classic storylines like "The Dark Phoenix Saga" and "Days of Future Past"[1][4].
- Under his guidance, X-Men became Marvel's best-selling series and one of the most popular comics in the industry[1][4].
- He launched several X-Men spin-off titles, including New Mutants in 1982 and Excalibur in 1987[1].
- His run saw the title transition from a bi-monthly to a monthly publication, and eventually to being published twice-monthly during summer periods from 1988 to 1990[5].

Claremont's departure in 1991 coincided with the launch of a second X-Men title, simply called X-Men. He wrote the first three issues of this new series before leaving Marvel due to creative differences[1][5].

His 16-year tenure on Uncanny X-Men remains one of the longest continuous runs by a single writer on a mainstream superhero comic book series[1][4].
