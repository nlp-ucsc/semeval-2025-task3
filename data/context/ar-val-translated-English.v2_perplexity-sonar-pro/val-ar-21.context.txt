Busia County was officially established on March 4, 2013, when Kenya's new devolved system of government came into effect following the promulgation of the 2010 Constitution[4]. However, the area has a much longer history as an administrative unit:

1. In 1963, Busia District was formed as an administrative district in the Western Province of Kenya[2]. This coincided with Kenya gaining independence.

2. Prior to 1963, the area was part of a larger administrative unit. In 1956, Elgon Nyanza District was split from North Nyanza District, with Bungoma as its headquarters[2].

3. In 1963, Elgon Nyanza District was further split into two: Bungoma and Busia districts, both within Western Province[2].

4. The town of Busia itself has an even longer history, starting as a market serving both Uganda and Kenya in the 1920s[1]. It was upgraded to Town Board status in July 1985 and then to Town Council status in 1989[1].

5. In May 2010, Busia town was elevated to Municipal status, becoming operational on July 1, 2010[1].

The transition from district to county status in 2013 was part of a nationwide restructuring of local government in Kenya. This change gave Busia County more autonomy in governance and resource allocation. The county now has its own elected governor, county assembly, and various county departments to manage local affairs[4][5].
