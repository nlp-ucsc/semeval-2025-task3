Chris Colfer wrote, directed, and starred in a musical spoof of "Sweeney Todd" called "Shirley Todd" during his senior year of high school[1][2][4]. This production was notable for gender-reversing all of the roles from the original musical. Colfer created this spoof as part of his involvement in his high school's drama club at Clovis East High School in Clovis, California[2][4].

The creation of "Shirley Todd" demonstrates Colfer's early interest and talent in writing and performing, which he would later develop into a successful career as an actor, singer, and author. This high school production foreshadowed his future creative endeavors, including writing and starring in his own film "Struck by Lightning" and authoring the bestselling "The Land of Stories" book series[1][4].
