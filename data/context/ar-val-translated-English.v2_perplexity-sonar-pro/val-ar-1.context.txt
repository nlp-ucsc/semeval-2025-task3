Galicia, an autonomous community located in northwestern Spain, is divided into four provinces[1][3][4][5][6]. These provinces are:

1. A Coru単a (also spelled La Coru単a)
2. Lugo
3. Ourense (also spelled Orense)
4. Pontevedra

Each of these provinces has its own capital city, which shares the same name as the province[1]. The autonomous community of Galicia was established by a statute of autonomy on April 6, 1981[3].

It's worth noting that historically, Galicia was organized differently. Until 1833, Galicia was divided into seven provinces[1][4][7]. These historical provinces were:

1. Santiago
2. Betanzos
3. A Coru単a
4. Lugo
5. Mondo単edo
6. Ourense
7. Tui

However, in 1833, a territorial reform reorganized Galicia into the four provinces we know today[1][4]. This reorganization was part of a larger effort to centralize administration across Spain[1].

Despite the current four-province structure, Galicia's historical legacy is still remembered. For example, the coat of arms depicted on the official Galician flag still has seven crosses to honor these historic provinces[7].

Today, Galicia's four provinces encompass a total area of 29,574 square kilometers (11,419 square miles)[3][4]. The region is known for its rich cultural heritage, stunning landscapes, and unique identity within Spain[1][3][5].
