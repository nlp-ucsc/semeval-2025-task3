Gillette Stadium serves as the official home field for two professional sports teams:

1. New England Patriots (NFL)[1][3]
The New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL) have called Gillette Stadium their home since it opened in 2002. The Patriots are the primary tenants of the stadium and have enjoyed tremendous success there, including multiple Super Bowl championship seasons[1][3].

2. New England Revolution (MLS)[1][3]
The New England Revolution, a Major League Soccer (MLS) team, also uses Gillette Stadium as their home field. The Revolution played the first official event at the stadium on May 11, 2002, defeating the Dallas Burn 2-0[1].

Additionally, while not their permanent home field, Gillette Stadium has served as a part-time venue for college football:

3. University of Massachusetts (UMass) Minutemen Football (NCAA)[1]
The UMass Minutemen football team used Gillette Stadium as their full-time home field for the 2012 and 2013 seasons. From 2014 to 2018, the stadium continued to host some UMass games, particularly those expected to draw larger crowds[1].

Gillette Stadium's versatility allows it to host various other events, including international soccer matches, concerts, and even ice hockey games like the 2016 NHL Winter Classic[1]. However, the Patriots and Revolution are the only teams that officially call Gillette Stadium their permanent home.
