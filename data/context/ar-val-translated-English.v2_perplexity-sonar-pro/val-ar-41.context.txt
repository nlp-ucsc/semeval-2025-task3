Bettina Heinen-Ayech was German. She was born on September 3, 1937 in Solingen, Germany[1][5]. Throughout her life and career, she maintained her German nationality, even though she spent significant time living and working in Algeria after marrying her Algerian husband Abdelhamid Ayech in the 1960s[2][3].

Heinen-Ayech was known as a German painter who became famous for her colorful landscape paintings of Algeria[5]. She developed a unique watercolor style that blended her German artistic training with inspiration from the Algerian landscapes and light[4]. 

While she lived between Germany and Algeria for much of her adult life, she remained connected to her German roots. She continued to exhibit her work regularly in Europe and maintained her childhood home in Solingen as a base[2][4]. Her dual connection to Germany and Algeria allowed her to act as a cultural bridge between Europe and North Africa through her art[6].

Heinen-Ayech passed away on June 7, 2020 in Munich, Germany at the age of 82, further confirming her lifelong German nationality[5]. Her legacy as a German artist who found inspiration in Algeria has been recognized through the establishment of the Bettina Heinen-Ayech Foundation in Germany, which aims to preserve her work and promote international cultural dialogue[6].
