The local language spoken by the inhabitants of Nahavand is the Nahavandi sub-dialect of the northern dialect of the Luri language[1]. This dialect is considered to be one of the closest dialects to Middle Persian, and is sometimes regarded as a distinct language[1].

Additionally, Southern Kurdish is also spoken in Nahavand[1].

It's important to note that the linguistic situation in Nahavand has evolved over time:

1. Historical context: During the Sasanian period (224-651 CE), Nahavand was part of the region where Pahlavi (Middle Persian) was spoken. Ebn al-Moqaffa' (died 759 CE) stated that Azerbaijan, Nahavand, Rayy, Hamadan, and Esfahan spoke Fahlavi (Pahlavi)[5].

2. Medieval period: According to Hamdallah Mostawafi, writing in the 1340s, the language of nearby Maragheh was described as "modified Pahlavi"[4].

3. Modern era: By the late 20th century, demographic data showed a shift in the linguistic landscape. According to statistics from 1997, approximately 99% of Nahavand's population of 184,160 spoke Luri and Laki[2].

This linguistic evolution reflects the complex history of the region, influenced by various cultural and political factors over the centuries. The persistence of the Luri language, particularly the Nahavandi sub-dialect, demonstrates the area's linguistic continuity despite historical changes.
