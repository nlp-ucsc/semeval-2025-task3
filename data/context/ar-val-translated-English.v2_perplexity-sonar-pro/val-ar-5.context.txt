Hamilton Academical Football Club was founded in late 1874[1][2][3]. More specifically, the club was established on December 12, 1874[8].

The club was formed by the rector of Hamilton Academy, James Blacklock, and pupils of the local school[1][3]. This makes Hamilton Academical unique as the only professional club in British football to have originated from a school team[2].

Some key points about the club's early history:

- The first recorded game played by the club was on December 12, 1874, against the Second XI of Hamilton FC[3].

- In February 1875, the club held its first Annual General Meeting, establishing official positions like president, captain, and secretaries[3].

- By September 1876, the club had been admitted to the Scottish Football Association[3].

- The club played its first Scottish Cup tie on October 14, 1876, losing 3-0 to Barrhead[3].

- In April 1877, the word "Cricket" was dropped from the club's title, officially becoming Hamilton Academical Football Club[3].

Hamilton Academical, often known as Hamilton Accies or The Accies, has since become an established part of Scottish football, competing in various divisions throughout its long history[2]. The club is currently celebrating its 150th anniversary in the 2024-2025 season[8], marking a significant milestone in its rich heritage.
