2. Seasonal variation: The lake's size can expand significantly during the rainy season, potentially doubling or tripling in area[1].

3. Ecological importance: Lake Mai-Ndombe and its surrounding swamp forests form the southern portion of the Tumba-Ngiri-Maindombe Ramsar wetlands, which are internationally recognized for their ecological significance[6].

4. Hydrology: The Fimi River drains Lake Mai-Ndombe and flows westward to join the Kasai River at Mushie[1].

5. Conservation efforts: The lake area includes the Mai Ndombe Conservation Concession, covering 299,640 hectares (740,400 acres) on the western shore. This is the first REDD+ community-based forest conservation project in the country[1].
