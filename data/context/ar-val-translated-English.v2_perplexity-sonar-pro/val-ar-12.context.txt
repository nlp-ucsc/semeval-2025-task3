Bruce Sterling did not win a Hugo Award for a novel. His Hugo Award wins were for shorter works:

1. He won the Hugo Award in 1997 for his novelette "Bicycle Repairman"[9][10].

2. He won the Hugo Award again in 1999 for his novelette "Taklamakan"[9][10].

While Sterling has been nominated for Hugo Awards in the novel category, including for his book "Islands in the Net" in 1989[2], he has not won a Hugo Award for a novel. His novel awards include:

- The John W. Campbell Memorial Award in 1989 for "Islands in the Net"[4][9][10].
- The Arthur C. Clarke Award in 2000 for his novel "Distraction"[4][9][10].

Sterling is a highly respected and influential science fiction author, particularly known for his contributions to the cyberpunk subgenre, but his Hugo Award wins have been in the shorter fiction categories rather than for novels.
