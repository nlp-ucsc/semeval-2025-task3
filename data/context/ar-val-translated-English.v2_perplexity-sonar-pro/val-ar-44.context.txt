The Fergana Valley is shared by three Central Asian countries:

1. Uzbekistan
2. Kyrgyzstan 
3. Tajikistan

This fertile valley, located in the heart of Central Asia, is divided among these three former Soviet republics[1][2]. The majority of the valley lies within eastern Uzbekistan, with portions extending into southern Kyrgyzstan and northern Tajikistan[2][6].

Some key points about the Fergana Valley's division:

- It covers an area of approximately 22,000 square kilometers (8,500 square miles)[2][6].
- The valley is roughly triangular in shape, bordered by various mountain ranges including the Tien Shan, Gissar, and Alay systems[6].
- It is one of the most densely populated regions in Central Asia, with a population of about 11 million people[5].
- The valley contains several enclaves and exclaves, which are territories belonging to one country but entirely surrounded by another country's territory[1][4].

The division of the Fergana Valley among these three countries has led to complex border issues, including disputes over land ownership, water rights, and ethnic tensions[3][5]. The region's strategic importance, coupled with its rich natural resources and fertile agricultural land, has made it a focal point for geopolitical interests and occasional conflicts between the sharing countries[5][7].
