Booker T. Washington died of complications from hypertension (high blood pressure) on November 14, 1915, at the age of 59[1][2][4]. Specifically, he suffered from malignant hypertension, which led to kidney failure and other complications[1][8].

The exact nature of Washington's illness was a subject of speculation for many years. Initially, his death was attributed to congestive heart failure and exhaustion[4]. However, a thorough review of his medical records in 2006 revealed a more precise diagnosis:

1. When admitted to the hospital two weeks before his death, Washington presented with symptoms including headaches, fatigue, weight loss, failing vision, frequent urination, and excessive thirst[1].

2. His blood pressure was extremely high - 220 systolic and 150 diastolic, more than twice the normal level[1][4].

3. Dr. Jackson T. Wright Jr., a professor of medicine at Case Western Reserve University, concluded that Washington "most certainly presented with malignant hypertension which resulted in kidney failure"[1].

4. The condition is now understood to have led to nephrosclerosis (kidney damage) and hypertensive cardiomyopathy (heart muscle disease caused by high blood pressure)[8].

It's worth noting that in 1915, there were no effective therapies for high blood pressure, and the importance of treating elevated blood pressure was not yet well recognized by the medical community[1]. The five-year survival rate for malignant hypertension at that time was less than one percent[1].

Washington's death certificate likely listed the cause as "Bright's disease," which was a historical term for kidney diseases[3][6]. However, modern analysis shows that this was a manifestation of his underlying hypertension.
