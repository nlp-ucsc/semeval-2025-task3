The city of Toruń is located on the Vistula River in north-central Poland[3][4]. The Vistula is Poland's longest river and the ninth-longest in Europe, stretching 1,047 kilometers (651 miles)[5].

Toruń's location on the Vistula has been significant throughout its history:

1. Strategic position: The city was established in the 13th century on the eastern bank of the Vistula River at its lower course, near a ford between lands belonging to the Piast dynasty and Prussia[2].

2. Border town: For centuries, the Vistula served as a natural border, with Toruń being a border town between Polish Kujawy and Prussian Chełmno lands[2].

3. Economic importance: The Vistula's role in trade and transportation contributed to Toruń becoming a major trading point and a leading member of the Hanseatic League[4][8].

4. Urban development: The city developed on both banks of the Vistula, with the older parts on the eastern side and later expansion to the western bank[2][4].

5. Natural features: The Toruń Valley, through which the Vistula flows, is a significant geographical feature of the region[1].

In addition to the Vistula, Toruń is also situated at the confluence of another river, the Drwęca[6]. This location at the junction of two rivers has further enhanced Toruń's strategic and economic importance throughout its history.
