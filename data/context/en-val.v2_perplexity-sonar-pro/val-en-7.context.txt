To calculate the number of days remaining from October 14th until the end of the year in a non-leap year, we need to count the days in the remaining months.

Here's the breakdown:

1. Remaining days in October: 31 - 14 = 17 days
2. Days in November: 30 days
3. Days in December: 31 days

Adding these up:
17 + 30 + 31 = 78 days

Therefore, if today is October 14th and it's not a leap year, there are 78 days remaining until the end of the year[1].

This period spans:
- 2 months and 17 days
- 11 weeks and 1 day
- Approximately 1,872 hours or 112,320 minutes[1]

It's worth noting that this calculation includes both the start date (October 14th) and the end date (December 31st). If we were to exclude the end date, it would be 77 days, but for the purpose of counting remaining days in the year, it's customary to include the last day.

In terms of weekdays and weekends, this period typically includes:
- 56 weekdays
- 22 weekend days[1]

This information can be useful for planning purposes, such as scheduling work projects, setting personal goals, or preparing for end-of-year activities.
