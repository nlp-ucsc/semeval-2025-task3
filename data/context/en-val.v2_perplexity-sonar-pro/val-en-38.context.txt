The two main factions in Bruce Sterling's "Schismatrix" are the Shapers and the Mechanists[1][6][7].

The Shapers focus on enhancing humanity through genetic engineering and biotechnology[1][6]. They aim to create a transhumanist utopia by modifying human biology and genetics[1]. Shapers use techniques like genetic manipulation, bioengineering, and psychotechnic training to augment human capabilities[1][6]. They tend to have an aristocratic society where genetic heritage is highly valued[1].

The Mechanists, on the other hand, seek to improve humanity through technology and mechanical augmentation[1][6]. They rely on machine implants, computer circuits, cybernetics, and artificial intelligence to enhance human abilities[1][6]. Mechanists specialize in areas like robotics, cybernetics, computers, and spacecraft[6]. Some extreme Mechanists even permanently seal their bodies in life-support shells or exist as computer simulations[1].

These two factions represent contrasting philosophies on how humanity should evolve and progress[6]. Their ideological differences lead to conflict and a "cool war" involving espionage, sabotage, and assassination throughout the solar system[6]. The struggle between Shapers and Mechanists forms the central tension in Sterling's "Schismatrix" universe, driving much of the plot and world-building in the novel and related short stories[1][3].
