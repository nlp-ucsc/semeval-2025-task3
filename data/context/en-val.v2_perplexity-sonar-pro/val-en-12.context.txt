The Red Bull Arena is located in Austria[1][3][4]. Specifically, it is situated in Wals-Siezenheim, a suburb on the outskirts of Salzburg, Austria's fourth-largest city[4]. The stadium serves as the home ground for FC Red Bull Salzburg, an Austrian professional football club that competes in the Austrian Bundesliga, which is the top flight of Austrian football[4].

The Red Bull Arena was originally opened in 2003 and has undergone several expansions and renovations since then[1][4]. It currently has a capacity of 30,188 spectators for domestic matches, making it one of the largest football stadiums in Austria[3][6]. For international matches, the capacity is slightly reduced to 29,520 due to UEFA regulations[6].

The stadium is located approximately 4.5 kilometers west of Salzburg's historic city center[5]. It's easily accessible by car via the A1 motorway and is also served by public transportation, including bus lines that connect it to Salzburg's main railway station and city center[5].
