Jef Raskin, the creator of the Macintosh computer project at Apple, died on February 26, 2005, at the age of 61[1][2]. He passed away in Pacifica, California, after being recently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer[1].

Raskin was a significant figure in the technology industry, particularly known for his work at Apple Computer. He joined Apple in 1978 as employee number 31 and led the Macintosh development team from its inception until 1982[1]. His vision for the Macintosh was to create a computer with an interface that was elegant and easy to use, which was a departure from the text-based interfaces common at the time[1].

Throughout his career, Raskin made substantial contributions to the field of human-computer interaction:

1. At Apple: He initiated and led the Macintosh project, naming it after his favorite type of apple (changing the spelling for copyright reasons)[1].

2. Post-Apple: After leaving Apple in 1982, Raskin continued to influence computer design through writing, lectures, and consulting work[1].

3. Canon Cat: He designed the Canon Cat computer for Canon USA, although it wasn't commercially successful[1].

4. Consulting: His clients included major tech companies like Intel, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM[1].

5. Publications: In 2000, he published "The Humane Interface," a book widely used in universities[1].

6. Raskin Center for Humane Interfaces: He founded this center to continue his work on improving computer interfaces[1].

Raskin's legacy extends beyond his technical achievements. He was also known for his diverse interests, including music (he taught recorder, harpsichord, and music theory) and radio-controlled model aircraft[1]. His work continues to influence the field of human-computer interaction, with his son Aza Raskin carrying on his father's work at the Raskin Center for Humane Interfaces[1].
