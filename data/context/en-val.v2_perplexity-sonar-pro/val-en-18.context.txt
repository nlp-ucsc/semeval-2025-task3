Yes, a graphics address remapping table (GART) is a type of input-output memory management unit (IOMMU)[7][9]. 

The GART functions as an IOMMU specifically designed for graphics processing units (GPUs) and other graphics hardware[7]. It provides address translation and memory remapping services that allow GPUs to access system memory more efficiently[3][5].

Key points about GART as an IOMMU:

1. Purpose: GART translates virtual addresses used by graphics devices into physical addresses in system memory[3][5].

2. Implementation: It is typically implemented as part of the chipset or integrated into modern CPUs[3].

3. Usage: GART is commonly used with Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) and PCI Express graphics cards on Intel and AMD systems[7].

4. Functionality: 
   - It allows graphics controllers to access large, contiguous virtual memory spaces that may be physically fragmented in system RAM[3].
   - Enables direct memory access (DMA) for graphics devices while providing memory protection[4].

5. Benefits:
   - Improves performance by allowing GPUs to access system memory directly without CPU intervention[3].
   - Enables more efficient use of memory resources between the CPU and GPU[3].

The GART serves the same fundamental purpose as other IOMMUs - providing address translation and memory protection services for I/O devices. However, it is specifically optimized for graphics processing needs[5][7].
