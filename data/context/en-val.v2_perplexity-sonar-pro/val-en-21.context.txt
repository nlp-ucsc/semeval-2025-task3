Kremlins and detinets are very similar and often used interchangeably, especially when referring to the fortified complex in Novgorod. However, there are some subtle distinctions:

1. Etymology and usage:
- "Detinets" is an older term used specifically in ancient Russia for city fortifications[1][2].
- "Kremlin" is a more general and widely used term for fortified city centers in Russia[2].

2. Historical context:
- The term "detinets" was primarily used in early medieval Russia, particularly for the Novgorod fortress[1][3].
- "Kremlin" became more common later and is now used for similar structures across Russia[2].

3. Specific to Novgorod:
- The fortified complex in Novgorod is traditionally known as the Novgorod Detinets[2][3].
- However, it is also frequently called the Novgorod Kremlin, and the terms are often used interchangeably[2][3][5].

4. Function:
- Both detinets and kremlins served as fortified city centers, housing administrative, religious, and sometimes residential buildings[1][2][5].
- They typically included stone walls, towers, and important structures like cathedrals and government buildings[1][2][5].

5. Prevalence:
- While "detinets" is mainly associated with Novgorod, there were hundreds of kremlins across Russia, with about 20 preserved to this day[1][2].

In essence, the Novgorod Detinets is a kremlin, but the use of "detinets" reflects its ancient origins and the specific historical context of Novgorod. The fortress in Novgorod is unique as it's often referred to by both terms, highlighting its significance as one of the oldest and most important fortified complexes in Russian history[3][5].
