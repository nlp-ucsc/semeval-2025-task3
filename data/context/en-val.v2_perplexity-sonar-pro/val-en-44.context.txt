The Sakya Trizin is the traditional title for the head of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism[4]. This lineage holder is considered to be an emanation of Manjushri, the Bodhisattva of Wisdom[2]. The Sakya Trizin is responsible for preserving and propagating the vast teachings and practices of the Sakya tradition, which is known for its comprehensive approach to Buddhist philosophy and tantra[5].

The Sakya lineage was founded in 1073 CE by Khön Könchog Gyalpo and has since been led by members of the noble Khön family[4]. The Sakya Trizin plays a crucial role in maintaining the continuity of teachings, performing important rituals, and guiding followers worldwide[3]. This position is highly revered in Tibetan Buddhism, alongside other major figures like the Dalai Lama and the Karmapa[2].
