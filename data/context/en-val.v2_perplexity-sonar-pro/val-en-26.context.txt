Yes, the Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI) is still maintained and continues to be an important resource for arts and humanities research. Here are the key details about its current status:

The AHCI remains an active part of the Web of Science Core Collection, which is maintained by Clarivate Analytics[1][3]. It covers over 1,800 journals across 28 arts and humanities disciplines, containing more than 4.9 million records and 33.4 million cited references dating back to 1975[3].

Some important recent developments regarding the AHCI include:

1. Impact Factor Inclusion: Starting with the 2023 release (covering 2022 data), journals in the AHCI will receive Impact Factors for the first time[2]. This is a significant change, as previously only journals in the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) received Impact Factors.

2. Coverage Expansion: The Web of Science Core Collection, which includes the AHCI, has been expanding its coverage. However, some researchers have raised concerns that the AHCI may not be receiving as much attention in this expansion compared to other indices[4][8].

3. Indexing Changes: Since 2018, the AHCI has ceased the systematic indexing of individually selected items from SCIE/SSCI journals[4][8]. This change may affect the interdisciplinary coverage of arts and humanities topics in the database.

4. Continued Importance: Despite these changes, the AHCI remains a valuable resource for researchers in the arts and humanities. It provides access to current and retrospective bibliographic information and cited references across a wide range of disciplines[5][7].

5. Global Coverage: The AHCI aims to provide global coverage of arts and humanities research. However, some scholars have criticized it for potentially underrepresenting publications in languages other than English[5].

In conclusion, while the Arts and Humanities Citation Index has undergone some changes in recent years, it continues to be maintained and developed as part of the Web of Science Core Collection. Its upcoming inclusion in the Journal Impact Factor calculations and ongoing coverage of arts and humanities journals demonstrate its continued relevance in the academic research landscape.
