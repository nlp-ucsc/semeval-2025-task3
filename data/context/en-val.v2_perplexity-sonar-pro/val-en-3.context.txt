No, not all arthropods have antennae. While antennae are a common feature among many arthropods, there are some groups that lack them entirely[1][4]. Here's a breakdown of antenna presence in major arthropod groups:

1. Chelicerates (spiders, mites, scorpions):
Chelicerates do not have antennae[4]. This group includes arachnids like spiders, mites, ticks, and scorpions[6][7].

2. Crustaceans:
Most crustaceans have two pairs of antennae[1][7]. This includes familiar animals like crabs, lobsters, shrimp, and crayfish.

3. Myriapods (centipedes and millipedes):
Myriapods have one pair of antennae[7].

4. Insects:
Insects have one pair of antennae[1][7].

5. Hexapods:
Among non-insect hexapods, Collembola (springtails) and Diplura have antennae, but Protura do not[1].

The presence or absence of antennae is an important characteristic in arthropod classification. For example, the lack of antennae in chelicerates is one of the key features that distinguishes them from other arthropod groups[4].

Antennae, when present, serve various important functions for arthropods, including:

- Sensing touch, air motion, heat, and vibration
- Detecting smells and tastes
- Aiding in mating practices (e.g., in some mosquito species)
- Assisting in flight stabilization (e.g., in some moth species)
- Helping in host plant identification for egg-laying (in some insect species)[1]

In conclusion, while antennae are a characteristic feature of many arthropods and play crucial roles in their sensory systems, they are not universal across all arthropod groups.
