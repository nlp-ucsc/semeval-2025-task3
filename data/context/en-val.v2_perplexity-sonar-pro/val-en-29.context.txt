The largest ethnic group in Katsina State is the Hausa-Fulani people[1][4][6]. Katsina is predominantly a mono-ethnic state, with the majority of its population being Hausa and Fulani[8]. 

The Hausa people form the core of the state's population, with the Fulani being closely associated and often referred to together as Hausa-Fulani due to their historical and cultural ties[1][4]. This ethnic composition is consistent across various sources and reflects the state's cultural and linguistic homogeneity.

Some key points about the ethnic composition of Katsina State:

2. Language: The state is described as mono-lingual, with Hausa being the primary language spoken[8].

3. Religious affiliation: The population is predominantly Muslim, which aligns with the Hausa-Fulani cultural identity[1][6].

However, for most practical and demographic purposes, they are considered as a single dominant ethnic group in Katsina State.
