The hostage-taking incident in Khobar, Saudi Arabia, in 2004 was carried out by militants affiliated with al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). The attack occurred on May 29-30, 2004, at the Oasis Residential Compound in Khobar, where the militants took both foreign and Saudi workers hostage. The attackers were targeting Western expatriates, particularly those from countries involved in military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The leader of the group responsible for the attack was believed to be Abdulaziz al-Muqrin, a senior figure in AQAP at the time. The attack resulted in the deaths of 22 people, including several Westerners, and marked a significant escalation in al-Qaeda's operational capacity within Saudi Arabia. The incident also led to a heightened security response from the Saudi government to counter extremist groups.
