The myriapods that do not have antennae are Symphyla and Pauropoda. These two groups are distinct from other myriapods like centipedes (Chilopoda) and millipedes (Diplopoda), which typically have antennae. Symphyla and Pauropoda have evolved without antennae, relying on other sensory structures to perceive their environment.
