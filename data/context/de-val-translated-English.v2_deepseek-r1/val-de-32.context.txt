In the International System of Units (SI), physical force is measured in **newtons (N)**. The newton is defined as the force required to accelerate a one-kilogram mass at a rate of one metre per second squared. Mathematically, it is expressed as \( 1\ \text{N} = 1\ \text{kg} \cdot 1\ \text{m/s}^2 \).
