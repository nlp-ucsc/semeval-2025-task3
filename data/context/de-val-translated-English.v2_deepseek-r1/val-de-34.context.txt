The Polish city of Toruń was not relocated a few kilometers to the east in the 13th century. Toruń has been continuously inhabited since its founding in 1233 by the Teutonic Knights, who established it as a fortified settlement. The city has remained in its original location on the Vistula River and has not been moved. Over the centuries, Toruń has grown and developed, preserving its medieval architecture and historical significance. It is a UNESCO World Heritage site, recognized for its well-preserved Gothic architecture and historic urban layout.
