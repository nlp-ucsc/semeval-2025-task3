Yep, that's correct! IOMMU stands for Input-Output Memory Management Unit. It's a hardware component in computers that plays a crucial role in managing memory access for input/output (I/O) devices. Essentially, it acts as a translator between the physical addresses used by the operating system and the virtual addresses used by the devices. This ensures that I/O devices can access the correct memory locations without causing conflicts or security issues. The IOMMU is particularly important in virtualized environments and systems that require isolation between different processes or virtual machines.
