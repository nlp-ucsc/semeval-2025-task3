The conflicts in the Kansas Territory, known as "Bleeding Kansas," were primarily caused by the debate over slavery. The Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 allowed the residents of the territory to decide whether to allow slavery through popular sovereignty. This led to pro-slavery and anti-slavery groups competing to influence the territorial government. Pro-slavery settlers, many from Missouri, and anti-slavery settlers, often from New England, clashed violently, leading to a series of confrontations and attacks. The tension ultimately contributed to the Civil War.
