The Duke of the Alemanni until the year 695 was Gottfried, also known as Godfrid. He ruled over the Alemanni, a Germanic tribe, during a period of significant transition and conflict. Gottfried's tenure as duke was marked by efforts to maintain the independence of the Alemanni amidst pressures from the Frankish Kingdom, which was expanding its influence under the Merovingian and later the Carolingian dynasties.

Gottfried's rule is notable for his strategic alliances and military campaigns. He was known to have dealings with the Lombards in Italy and may have sought to counterbalance Frankish power by fostering relations with other neighboring tribes and kingdoms. His leadership likely involved both diplomatic maneuvering and military engagement to protect Alemannic interests.

After Gottfried's death around 695, the Frankish influence over the Alemanni intensified. The Franks, under Charles Martel and later the Carolingians, gradually incorporated the Alemanni into their empire, leading to the eventual integration of the duchy into the Frankish realm.

Thus, Gottfried's duchy until 695 represents a period of Alemannic autonomy before the gradual absorption into the expanding Frankish Empire.
