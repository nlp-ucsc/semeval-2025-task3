The Red Bull Arena in Wals-Siezenheim, which is the home stadium of FC Red Bull Salzburg, was modified to host matches during the European Football Championship, commonly known as the Euros.

Here are some of the key modifications made to the stadium:

1. **Expansion of Seating Capacity:** The stadium's seating capacity was increased to accommodate a larger number of spectators for the tournament. The usual capacity of around 30,000 was expanded to approximately 40,000 seats to meet the requirements of hosting a major international event like the Euros.

2. **Temporary Infrastructure:** Temporary seating areas and stands were added to increase the seating capacity. These are usually modular structures that can be installed and removed as needed.

3. **Pitch Renovation:** The playing field was renovated to ensure it meets the high standards required for international football matches. This included maintaining perfect grass quality, even with the increased number of matches.

4. **Lighting and Sound Systems:** The stadium's lighting and sound systems were upgraded to provide a better experience for both the players and the spectators. This included state-of-the-art floodlights and sound systems to enhance the overall atmosphere during the matches.

5. **Security Enhancements:** Security was a top priority for the tournament. The stadium underwent various security upgrades, including the installation of more CCTV cameras, access control systems, and thorough security checks for all attendees.

6. **Media Facilities:** To accommodate the large number of journalists and broadcasters covering the event, the stadium's media facilities were expanded. This included additional press boxes, interview areas, and improved connectivity to ensure smooth broadcasting of the matches.

7. **Fan Zones:** Additional fan zones were created both inside and outside the stadium to cater to the large number of supporters. These areas were equipped with large screens, food and beverage outlets, and other amenities to enhance the fan experience.

8. **Accessibility Improvements:** The stadium made improvements to ensure better accessibility for all fans, including those with disabilities. This included adding more accessible seating areas and improving the pathways and facilities within the stadium.

These modifications were essential to ensure that the Red Bull Arena could host successful and memorable matches during the European Football Championship. After the tournament, some of the temporary structures might have been removed, bringing the stadium back to its original configuration or keeping some upgrades for future events.
