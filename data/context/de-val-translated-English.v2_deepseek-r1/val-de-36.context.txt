Pregnancy in humans typically lasts for approximately 40 weeks. This duration is measured from the first day of the woman's last menstrual period (LMP). It's important to note that this is an average, and actual pregnancies can vary slightly. A pregnancy is considered full-term between 37 weeks and 42 weeks of gestation. Deliveries that occur before 37 weeks are classified as preterm, while those that occur after 42 weeks are considered post-term.
