Cerebral palsy (CP) is primarily caused by brain injury or developmental issues early in life, and while it's often linked to factors like prematurity or birth asphyxia, there's growing evidence that genetics may play a role in some cases. However, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact proportion of CP cases that are directly attributable to genetic factors.

Research suggests that about 1% to 3% of CP cases have a clear genetic cause. These cases are often part of broader genetic syndromes or involve mutations in genes that affect brain development. For instance, mutations in genes like *ACTB*, *TUBA1A*, and *FOXG1* have been associated with certain types of CP.

In a larger context, while some studies suggest that genetic factors may contribute to the risk in up to 10% to 15% of cases, most CP cases are multifactorial, involving a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental or nongenetic risk factors (like infections or prenatal issues).

In summary, while genetics is a factor in a small percentage of cerebral palsy cases, the majority of CP is not solely due to genetic causes but is influenced by a mix of genetic and environmental factors.
