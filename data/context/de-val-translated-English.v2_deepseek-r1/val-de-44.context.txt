Posey County in the state of Indiana was formed in 1814 from what was originally part of the Illinois Territory. Specifically, it was carved out of the Indiana Territory, which at that time encompassed a large area that included parts of present-day Illinois. The county was created by the Indiana Territorial Legislature and named after General Thomas Posey, a prominent military figure and statesman who played significant roles in the region's early history. The formation of Posey County was part of the ongoing process of dividing and organizing the territories into more manageable administrative regions as the population and development of the area grew. This division reflects the gradual expansion and settling of the region, leading to the establishment of formal counties that could better serve the local populace.
