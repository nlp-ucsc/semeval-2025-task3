I apologize, but I don't have accurate information about Moritz Volz's current coaching position since 2019. The search results provided do not contain any recent information about Moritz Volz's coaching career. The most recent information available is that he played for Fulham Football Club until 2004[1], but this is outdated and does not address his coaching roles. Without more current and reliable sources, I cannot provide a definitive answer about which team he may be working with as an assistant coach since 2019.
