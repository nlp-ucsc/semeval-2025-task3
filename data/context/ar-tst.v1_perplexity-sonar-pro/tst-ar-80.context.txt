I apologize, but I don't have enough accurate information to provide the specific title of Carlo Gozzi's memoirs written in defense of himself after the scandal caused by his play "Love's Medicines" (which I assume is a translation of "Le droghe d'amore"). 

Carlo Gozzi was an Italian playwright who lived from 1720 to 1806[7]. He wrote several plays and was known for his fairy tale-inspired works. However, the specific memoirs you're asking about and the scandal related to "Love's Medicines" are not mentioned in the search results provided.

To give a more accurate and detailed answer, I would need access to more specific historical sources about Gozzi's life and works. If you have any additional information or context about this particular incident in Gozzi's career, it might help in finding the correct title of his memoirs.
