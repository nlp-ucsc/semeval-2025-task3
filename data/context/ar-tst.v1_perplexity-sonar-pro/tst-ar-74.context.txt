In Japan, the NES Classic Edition is known as the Nintendo Classic Mini: Family Computer, or more commonly referred to as the Famicom Mini[1][3]. This version is based on the original Japanese Famicom (Family Computer) console, which was released in Japan in 1983, two years before the NES was introduced in North America[6].

The Famicom Mini features a design that closely resembles the original Japanese Famicom console, with a white and red color scheme that differs from the gray design of the NES Classic Edition released in other regions[6]. Like its international counterpart, the Famicom Mini is a miniaturized version of the original console, scaled down to about 60% of the original size[6].

Key differences between the Famicom Mini and the NES Classic Edition include:

1. Design: The Famicom Mini replicates the distinctive red and white color scheme of the original Japanese console[6].

2. Controllers: The Famicom Mini comes with two hardwired controllers that are stored in slots on the sides of the console, mimicking the original Famicom design[1].

3. Game library: While many games are common between versions, the Famicom Mini includes some titles that are exclusive to the Japanese market[3].

The Famicom Mini was released in Japan on November 10, 2016, the same day as the Australian release and one day before the North American and European release of the NES Classic Edition[3]. Despite the regional differences, both versions serve the same purpose of allowing players to enjoy classic Nintendo games from the 1980s on modern televisions with improved video output through HDMI connections[6].
