The protests in Peru at the beginning of 2022 were closely linked to the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic exacerbated existing inequalities, and the government's response was perceived as inadequate, leading to widespread discontent. Protesters were primarily from rural and indigenous communities, who faced severe economic hardships, including rising fuel and food prices. These factors, combined with political instability, contributed to the unrest.
