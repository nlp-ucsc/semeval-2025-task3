The predecessor event to the American Civil War that occurred in Kansas is known as "Bleeding Kansas." This period of violent conflict took place in the mid-1850s and involved pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions clashing over whether Kansas would enter the Union as a slave state or a free state. The tensions were further exacerbated by the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which allowed the residents of each territory to decide the issue of slavery through popular sovereignty. This led to a series of violent confrontations, including the sack of Lawrence and the Pottawatomie massacre, which contributed to the escalating tensions leading up to the Civil War.
