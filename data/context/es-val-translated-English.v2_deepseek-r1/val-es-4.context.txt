IOMMU stands for Input-Output Memory Management Unit. It is a hardware component used in computing to manage memory access for input/output (I/O) devices. The IOMMU allows for the translation of virtual addresses used by I/O devices into physical addresses in system memory, improving security and memory management by preventing I/O devices from accessing unauthorized regions of memory. It's particularly important in virtualization environments to ensure that each virtual machine's I/O operations are isolated and secure.
