The black-headed oriole (Oriolus brachyrynchus) is primarily found in **Africa**. They are common breeding birds in sub-Saharan regions and are known for their striking black, yellow, and red plumage. These birds frequent woodlands and urban gardens, adding vibrant colors to their habitats. The males are especially notable for their bright plumage, which stands out against the dappled greenery of their native African landscapes.
