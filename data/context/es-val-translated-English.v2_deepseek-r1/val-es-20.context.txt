The last Soviet space station was Mir. Mir was launched on February 20, 1986, and it remained in operation until its controlled descent into the Earth's atmosphere on March 23, 2001. During its 15-year operational life, Mir was continuously occupied by cosmonauts for nearly a decade, setting a record for the longest continuous human presence in space. Mir was a modular space station, consisting of several components and modules added over the years, and it played a significant role in space research and international collaboration. After the Soviet Union dissolved, Mir continued to operate under Russian management until it was deorbited.
