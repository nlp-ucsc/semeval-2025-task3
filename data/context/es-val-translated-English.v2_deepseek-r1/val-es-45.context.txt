The most well-known project of Jef Raskin at Apple is the Macintosh computer. Raskin, a human-computer interface expert, initiated the Macintosh project in the late 1970s with the goal of creating an intuitive, user-friendly computer that was both powerful and accessible to a broad audience. The Macintosh introduced the graphical user interface (GUI), which featured icons, windows, and a mouse for navigation. Although Raskin left Apple before the Macintosh was released in 1984, his vision and foundational work laid the groundwork for the revolutionary product. His contributions to the project significantly influenced the direction of personal computing and set a standard for user-friendly design.
