Fungi of the order Erysiphales, commonly known as powdery mildew fungi, primarily infect plants. They are obligate parasites that can be found on a wide variety of plant hosts. These fungi are known to cause powdery mildew diseases, which can affect numerous plant species, including crops, ornamental plants, and wild plants.

Here are some of the living beings affected by fungi of the order Erysiphales:

1. **Plants**: The primary hosts are plants, including agricultural crops like grapes, cucurbits (e.g., cucumbers, melons), roses, and many others.
2. **Fungi**: Some species within Erysiphales are known to be hyperparasitic, meaning they can infect other fungi that are already parasitizing a plant host.
3. **Insects**: Although not their primary hosts, there have been reports of Erysiphales fungi infecting certain insects, particularly those that are closely associated with infected plants.

It's worth noting that while these fungi can affect a broad range of organisms, their main impact is on plants, where they can cause significant damage and reduce productivity, especially in agricultural settings.
