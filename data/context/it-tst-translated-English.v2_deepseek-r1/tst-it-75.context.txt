The washed rind of Maroilles cheese is typically orange or reddish-orange in color. This distinctive coloration comes from the cheesemaking process, where the cheese is washed in saltwater or another liquid, such as beer or wine, during the aging process. This washing not only contributes to the cheese's color but also to its strong aroma and flavorful profile.
