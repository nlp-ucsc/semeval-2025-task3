As of my last update in July 2024, Line 8 of the Paris Metro does cross the Seine River. Specifically, it passes under the Seine when traveling between the stations of "Concorde" and "Madeleine" in one direction, and when going from "Madeleine" to "Concorde" in the other direction. This part of the line allows passengers to move beneath the river, connecting the left and right banks of Paris.

If there have been any changes or updates to the metro lines after July 2024, I recommend checking a current map or the official Paris Metro website for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
