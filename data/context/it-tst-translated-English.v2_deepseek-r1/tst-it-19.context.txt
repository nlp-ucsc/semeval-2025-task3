In the movie "Sweet Home Alabama," Andrew's mother, Mayzell, is portrayed by actress Mary Kay Place. During the wedding scene between Andrew Hennings (played by Patrick Dempsey) and Melanie Carmichael (played by Reese Witherspoon), Mayzell accidentally sets the wedding dress on fire. This occurs when she is trying to help with the wedding preparations, and her act of kindness leads to a bit of chaos. The scene is played for comedic effect and highlights the charming but slightly eccentric nature of Melanie's family. Ultimately, the incident adds to the movie's humor and character dynamics without derailing the overall plot.
