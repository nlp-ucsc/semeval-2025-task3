Jomsborg, as mentioned in the Nordic family book (Nordiska familjebok), is associated with Jomsborg, which is linked to the Jomsvikings. According to historical records, Jomsborg was a fortified settlement or stronghold believed to have been located on the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, possibly in present-day Poland or Germany.

In the Nordiska familjebok, it is described as a place of great importance during the Viking Age, particularly known for its association with the Jomsvikings, a group of Viking warriors. The exact location has been debated among historians and scholars, but it is often suggested to be near the mouth of the Oder River in modern-day Poland.

The Jomsvikings were known for their strict code of conduct and their involvement in various raids and battles in the Baltic region during the 10th and 11th centuries. Jomsborg's strategic location allowed the Jomsvikings to control trade routes and exert influence over the surrounding areas.

While the exact site of Jomsborg remains a subject of historical research and debate, its significance in the history of the Viking Age and its association with the Jomsvikings are well-documented in the Nordiska familjebok and other historical sources.
