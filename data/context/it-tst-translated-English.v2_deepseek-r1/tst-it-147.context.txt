The Aston Martin Vanquish replaced the Aston Martin DBS. When the Vanquish was introduced in 2012, it took the place of the DBS as the brand's flagship grand tourer. However, it's worth noting that Aston Martin later revived the DBS name with the DBS Superleggera in 2018, which succeeded the second-generation Vanquish.
