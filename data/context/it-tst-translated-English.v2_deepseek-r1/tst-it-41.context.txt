Gu Bon-gil is a South Korean fencer who has competed in the Olympics. Unfortunately, as of my last update in July 2024, I don't have information about Gu Bon-gil winning an Olympic gold medal. It's possible that he may have achieved this in a more recent event that I don't have data on. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking the latest Olympic records or sports news sources.
