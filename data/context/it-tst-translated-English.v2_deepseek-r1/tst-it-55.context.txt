The Aesculus hippocastanum, commonly known as the horse chestnut, produces clusters of showy, white flowers in late spring. Each individual flower has five petals and may feature distinctive pink or yellow markings. These markings often serve to guide pollinators to the center of the flower, where nectar and pollen are located. This characteristic is a common strategy in many flowering plants to enhance pollination efficiency. The horse chestnut's inflorescence is erect and typically appears as a tall, cone-shaped panicle, adding a striking feature to the landscape during its blooming period.
