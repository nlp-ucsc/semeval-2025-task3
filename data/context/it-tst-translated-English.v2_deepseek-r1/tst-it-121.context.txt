The Gukurahundi operation in Zimbabwe was carried out by the 5th Brigade. The 5th Brigade was an elite unit of the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) that was trained by North Korean instructors and was specifically tasked with conducting counter-insurgency operations. This operation took place primarily in the early 1980s, shortly after Zimbabwe gained independence in 1980, and was aimed at suppressing dissent and opposition in the western regions of the country, particularly against the political group ZAPU (Zimbabwe African People's Union) and its supporters. The name "Gukurahundi" roughly translates to "the early rain that washes away the chaff" in the Shona language, symbolizing the government's intent to rid the country of perceived enemies. The operation is widely regarded as one of the darkest chapters in Zimbabwean history, resulting in thousands of deaths and human rights abuses.
