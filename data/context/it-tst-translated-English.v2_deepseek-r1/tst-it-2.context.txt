The plasmodium of Fuligo septica, commonly known as the dog vomit slime mold, typically exhibits a creamy to bright yellow coloration. This vibrant yellow hue is a key characteristic that helps in identifying this species in its plasmodial stage. The color tends to remain consistent throughout its growth, making it quite conspicuous when it appears on various surfaces such as mulch,paths, and other areas with rich organic matter.
