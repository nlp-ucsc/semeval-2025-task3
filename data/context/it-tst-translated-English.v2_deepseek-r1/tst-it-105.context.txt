The Garajonay National Park, located on the island of La Gomera in the Canary Islands, Spain, is known for its rich biodiversity. While it is more renowned for its lush forests and unique flora, it also hosts a variety of reptiles. Among the species found in the park are the Gomeran skink (Chalcides viridanus), the Canary lizard (Gallotia goliath), and the Atlantic gecko (Tarentola delalandii). These reptiles adapt to the park's diverse habitats, ranging from semantic rock formations to more vegetated areas.
