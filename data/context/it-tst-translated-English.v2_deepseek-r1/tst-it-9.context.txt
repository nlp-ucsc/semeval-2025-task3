The first modern pentathlon event was held at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden. The winner of that inaugural event was the Swedish athlete Torsten Sylvan. Modern pentathlon was created by Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic Games, and it was first introduced at the 1912 Olympics. Sylvan, who was a cavalry officer, excelled in the five disciplines of shooting, swimming, fencing, equestrian show jumping, and cross-country running to take the gold medal. His victory marked the beginning of a long tradition of the modern pentathlon in the Olympic Games.
