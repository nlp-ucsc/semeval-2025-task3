The producer of Blondie's 1977 album "Plastic Letters" was Richard Gottehrer. Gottehrer was a well-known producer and songwriter, and he had previously worked with The Go-Go's and other notable bands of the era. His production style helped shape the sound of "Plastic Letters," which included the hit single "Denis." Blondie's later albums, such as "Parallel Lines," were produced by different individuals, but Gottehrer's contributions to "Plastic Letters" were significant in furthering the band's success during that period.
