El Al Flight 402 was a scheduled international passenger flight operated by El Al Israel Airlines that was shot down on July 27, 1955. The flight was en route from Vienna, Austria, to Tel Aviv, Israel, with a stop in Istanbul, Turkey. The aircraft, a Lockheed L-049 Constellation, strayed into Bulgarian airspace due to navigation errors, and was intercepted and shot down by Bulgarian Air Force MiG-15 fighters. All 51 passengers and 7 crew members on board were killed in the incident.

The exact number of planes involved in shooting down El Al Flight 402 is reported to be two Bulgarian MiG-15 fighters. These fighters were scrambled by the Bulgarian military after the El Al plane entered Bulgarian airspace without proper clearance. The incident occurred during a period of heightened tensions in the region, and it remains one of the deadliest examples of a commercial airliner being shot down by military aircraft.

It's worth noting that this event was a tragic consequence of the Cold War era, where airspace violations often led to severe consequences. The shooting down of El Al Flight 402 underscores the importance of clear communication, accurate navigation, and diplomatic protocols to prevent such incidents.
