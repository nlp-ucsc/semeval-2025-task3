The term "French paradox" was popularized by Dr. Serge Renaud, a French scientist, in the 1990s. He observed that despite consuming a diet relatively high in saturated fats, the French population had lower rates of coronary heart disease compared to other developed countries. This phenomenon drew attention to the potential health benefits of certain aspects of the French diet, such as red wine consumption and emphasis on fresh, whole foods.
