Canavanine is an amino acid that is structurally similar to the amino acid arginine. Both canavanine and arginine are arginyl amino acids, meaning they share a similar arginine-like structure but with some modifications. Canavanine is known for its role as a competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase and has been studied in various biochemical contexts.
