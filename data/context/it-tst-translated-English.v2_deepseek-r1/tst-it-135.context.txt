Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi, commonly known as HJK Helsinki, has a rich history in Finnish football. As for winning the Suomen Cup, which is Finland's premier cup competition, HJK Helsinki has been quite successful over the years.

Now, to determine specifically when they won their seventh Suomen Cup, I would need to look into the historical records of the competition. However, I don't have access to the most up-to-date or detailed historical data, so I can't provide the exact year off the top of my head.

But I can suggest some resources where you might be able to find this information. The official website of the Football Association of Finland (SPL) or the HJK Helsinki club website might have historical records of the Suomen Cup winners. Additionally, sports archives or historical sports databases could also be useful sources for this information.

If you're interested, I can try to guide you on how to search for this information using these resources.
