The Pontifical Gregorian University, commonly known as the Gregorian University, has an emblem that reflects its rich history and academic mission. The emblem typically features several key elements:

1. **The Wolf and Twins**: The central part of the emblem usually depicts a she-wolf nursing two twins, Romulus and Remus. This imagery is a reference to the mythological founders of Rome and symbolizes the nurturing and founding spirit of education.

2. **The Cross**: Above or surrounding the wolf and twins, there is often a cross, symbolizing the institution's connection to the Catholic Church and its commitment to Christian values.

3. **The Phrygian Cap**: Sometimes included, the Phrygian cap, associated with liberty, can be part of the emblem, representing the pursuit of knowledge and intellectual freedom.

4. **The Motto**: The university's motto, often inscribed in Latin, might be included in the emblem. The motto is "Illumina Domine Intellectus" or similar, translating to "Illuminate, Lord, our Intellect" or a variation thereof, emphasizing the quest for enlightenment through faith and reason.

The overall design is deeply symbolic, combining elements of Roman heritage, Christian tradition, and academic pursuit, reflecting the university's mission to integrate faith and learning.
