Theano, an ancient Greek philosopher, is often associated with the Pythagorean school. In some accounts, she is referred to as the wife or daughter of Pythagoras, the famous Greek philosopher and mathematician. According to certain sources, Theano had two children: a daughter named Damo and a son named Telauges.

Damo is particularly noted in history for her strong connection to her father's teachings and for her role in preserving his works. Telauges, on the other hand, is less frequently mentioned in historical texts, but he is also believed to have been involved in the Pythagorean tradition.

It's worth noting that historical records from that period are not always consistent or comprehensive, so while these are the most commonly cited names associated with Theano, there may be variations or additional details in different sources.
