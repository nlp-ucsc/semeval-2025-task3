Isolobodon portoricensis is a prehistoric species of rodent that was once found in Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Capromyidae, which includes various extinct and extant rodent species, many of which were endemic to the Caribbean islands. Isolobodon portoricensis is one of the few species of these Caribbean rodents that have been discovered and studied.

These rodents were likely herbivores, feeding on plants, fruits, and seeds. They were probably ground-dwelling animals, similar to modern-day capybaras or guinea pigs in terms of their ecological roles. The extinction of Isolobodon portoricensis, along with many other endemic Caribbean rodents, is believed to be linked to the arrival of humans in the region and the introduction of invasive species such as rats, cats, dogs, and other predators. These factors, combined with habitat destruction, likely led to their extinction.

Studying these extinct species helps scientists understand the history of biodiversity in the Caribbean and the impacts of human activities on island ecosystems.
