A retronym is a term that is retrospectively applied to describe something that was previously referred to by a more generalized term, often due to technological advancements or changes in terminology. In other words, it's a new name or descriptor for an existing concept, product, or practice that becomes necessary when a newer version or alternative is introduced.

For example:

- **Acoustic guitar** became a retronym after the introduction of the electric guitar. Before electricity, guitars were simply "guitars," but once electric guitars arrived, the original type needed a distinguishing name.

- **Landline** is another retronym. Before mobile phones became widespread, people just had "phones." After cell phones became common, the traditional phone became a "landline."

- **Film camera** is a retronym that emerged after digital cameras became popular. Before digital technology, cameras simply used film, so they were just called "cameras."

Retronyms often arise when new technologies or innovations cause a need to differentiate between older and newer versions of a product or concept. They help clarify and avoid confusion in communication.
