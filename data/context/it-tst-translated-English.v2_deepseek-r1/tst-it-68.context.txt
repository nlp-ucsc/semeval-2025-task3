Hello! International Klein Blue, often abbreviated as IKB, is a deep blue pigment created by artist Yves Klein in the 1950s. While it's most commonly associated with the color blue, it doesn't have an official hexadecimal (hex) value because it's not part of the standard RGB or web color spectrum. Hex codes are used for digital displays, and IKB was originally designed for use in physical art.

If you're looking for a digital approximation, you can find various interpretations online, but there's no official one. If you need a specific hex code for a project, I can help you find something close!
