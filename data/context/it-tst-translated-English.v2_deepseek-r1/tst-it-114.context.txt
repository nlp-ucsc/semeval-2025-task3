The light cruiser **Emden** of the German Kriegsmarine did not sink in 1945. In fact, the **Emden** was torpedoed and sunk much earlier, on **May 7, 1945**, but this was just a few days before the end of World War II in Europe. 

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. To clarify, the **Emden** was indeed torpedoed by British bombers on **May 3, 1945**, while she was anchored in the Heikendorfer Bay near Kiel, Germany. She capsized and sank the following day, **May 4, 1945**. This was during the final stages of World War II in Europe, as Allied forces were closing in on Germany.
