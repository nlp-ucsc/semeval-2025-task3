The eye socket, also known as the orbit, is a bony cavity in the skull that surrounds and protects the eyeball. It is divided into several walls and margins, which provide structural support and protection to the eye.

1. **Walls of the Orbit**:
   - **Roof (Superior Wall)**: This is the upper part of the orbit and is formed by the orbital plate of the frontal bone and the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone.
   - **Floor (Inferior Wall)**: This is the lower part of the orbit and is primarily formed by the maxilla bone. The floor also includes contributions from the zygomatic bone and the orbital plate of the palatine bone.
   - **Medial Wall**: This is the inner wall of the orbit, which is nearest to the midline of the face. It is formed by the lacrimal bone, the orbital plate of the ethmoid bone, and the sphenoid bone.
   - **Lateral Wall**: This is the outer wall of the orbit, formed by the zygomatic bone and the greater wing of the sphenoid bone.

2. **Margins of the Orbit**:
   - **Superior Margin**: Located at the top of the orbit, formed by the frontal bone.
   - **Inferior Margin**: Located at the bottom of the orbit, formed by the maxilla and zygomatic bones.
   - **Medial Margin**: Located on the inner side of the orbit, formed by the lacrimal bone and the ethmoid bone.
   - **Lateral Margin**: Located on the outer side of the orbit, formed by the zygomatic bone.

In summary, the orbit has four walls (roof, floor, medial, and lateral) and four margins (superior, inferior, medial, and lateral), each contributing to the structural integrity and protection of the eye.
