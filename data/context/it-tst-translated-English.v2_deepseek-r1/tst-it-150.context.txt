During the 2013 Iranian presidential election, several candidates were initially approved by the Guardian Council to run for the presidency. However, one candidate withdrew from the race during the campaign. 

**Mohammad Reza Aref**, who was the vice president under Mohammad Khatami, withdrew from the race on June 11, 2013. He did so to avoid splitting the reformist vote, which could have helped the conservative candidate, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, win the election. Aref's withdrawal was seen as a strategic move to support another candidate, Hassan Rouhani, who ultimately won the election.

There may have been other candidates who considered withdrawing or whose candidacies were less prominent, but Mohammad Reza Aref is the most notable candidate who officially withdrew during the campaign.
