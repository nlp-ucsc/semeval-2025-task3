Richard Layard, Baron Layard, co-founded the Action for Happiness movement with Geoff Mulgan and Anthony Seldon.

Action for Happiness is a UK-based non-profit organization focused on promoting psychological well-being and happiness through evidence-based actions and community initiatives. 

It was established in 2011, aiming to encourage people to take practical steps to improve their own well-being and that of others.

The movement emphasizes the importance of mental and emotional well-being, recognizing that happiness is much more than just a temporary state; it's a long-term goal that can be cultivated through positive actions and behaviors.

Action for Happiness provides resources, courses, and a supportive community to help individuals and organizations foster and maintain happiness.

By focusing on both personal and community well-being, the movement seeks to create a society where happiness is valued and nurtured in everyday life.
