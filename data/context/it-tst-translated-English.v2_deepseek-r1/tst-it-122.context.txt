In Greek mythology, Ares, the god of war, was captured by the Aloadae, who were giant brothers named Otus and Ephialtes. They imprisoned him in a bronze jar for 13 months. Eventually, Ares was freed with the help of Hermes, the messenger god. Hermes tricked the Aloadae and managed to rescue Ares from his captivity.
