The tower at 111 West 57th Street, also known as Central Park Tower, features a Tuned Mass Damper (TMD) to mitigate wind-induced swaying. While the exact weight of the damper isn't publicly disclosed, it's typically in the range of hundreds of tons for such structures. For precise information, consulting the engineering or architectural team behind the project would be necessary.
