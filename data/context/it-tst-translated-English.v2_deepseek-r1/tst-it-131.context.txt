King Bahram I of the Sassanian Empire, who ruled from 271 to 274 CE, had coins that typically depicted his portrait on the obverse (front side). These portraits often showed Bahram I wearing a crown, which was a common feature of Sassanian coinage to signify royal authority. The reverse side of the coins usually featured a Zoroastrian fire altar, which was a significant symbol of the empire's religious beliefs and practices. This design was consistent with the numismatic traditions of the Sassanian Empire, which emphasized the king's divine right to rule and the central role of Zoroastrianism in the empire's identity.
