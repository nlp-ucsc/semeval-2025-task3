As of my last update in July 2024, I don't have specific information on a person named Richard V. Spencer holding a role at Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). It's possible that he may have been involved in some capacity, but without more details, I can't provide a definitive answer. If you're looking for the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking ICE's official website or recent news releases.
