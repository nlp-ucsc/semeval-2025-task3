The river Iravati, also known as the Irrawaddy River, is associated with the Hindu goddess **Annapoorna**. However, the Iravati is more directly linked to **Ganga**, who is considered the personification of the Ganges River. In some texts, the Iravati is also associated with **Saraswati**, another prominent Hindu goddess.

But I think there might be some confusion here. The Irrawaddy River is primarily associated with Buddhist mythology in Myanmar (Burma), where it is considered sacred. In Hindu mythology, the Ganges River is the most prominent sacred river.

If you meant a different river named Iravati, could you provide more context? I'd be happy to clarify!
