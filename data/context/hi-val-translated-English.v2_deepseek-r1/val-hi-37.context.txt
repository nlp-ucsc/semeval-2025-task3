The legend of "La Llorona" ("The Weeping Woman") is most famously known in Mexico and other Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America. It is a traditional ghost story that has been passed down through generations and is deeply rooted in Mexican folklore. The tale has variations, but it typically involves a woman who drowned her children and is doomed to wander the earth, weeping and searching for them. 

La Llorona is particularly well-known in countries like Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, and Argentina. In the United States, especially in areas with large Hispanic populations, the legend is also widely recognized. The story has also gained some popularity globally through various adaptations in films, books, and other media. 

The legend varies slightly from region to region, but the core theme of a mourning, vengeful spirit remains consistent.
