The largest empire in Indian history is often considered to be the *Maurya Empire* or the *British Raj*, depending on the context. 

- **Maurya Empire** (322–185 BCE): At its peak under Emperor Ashoka, it covered much of the Indian subcontinent, including present-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and parts of Afghanistan, Iran, and Central Asia. Its area is estimated to be around **5-6 million square kilometers**.
  
- **British Raj** (1858–1947): This was the largest empire in Indian history in terms of global reach, covering not just the Indian subcontinent but also vast territories worldwide. However, focusing strictly on the Indian subcontinent, it encompassed nearly all of modern India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and parts of other surrounding regions, stretching over **4.5 million square kilometers**.

So, if we consider the *Maurya Empire* in ancient times, it was the largest empire in India, spanning **around 5-6 million square kilometers**.
