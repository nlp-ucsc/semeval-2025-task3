The second president of South Africa was Nelson Mandela, but this depends on the context of the political era. Let me provide more details.

Under apartheid, the last state president was F.W. de Klerk. After the end of apartheid, Nelson Mandela became the first president of the new democratic South Africa. 

If you're referring to after Mandela, the second president was Thabo Mbeki. However, it's important to clarify whether you're talking about the apartheid era or the post-apartheid era.

To provide a clear answer, I need to know the specific historical context you're referring to.
