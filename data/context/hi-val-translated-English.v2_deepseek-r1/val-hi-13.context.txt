Microsoft Neptune was not a widely recognized product or project from Microsoft. However, there was a project called "Neptune" that was an internal codename for what eventually became Windows XP. Neptune was a planned consumer-oriented version of Windows NT, but it was canceled in 1999. Instead, Microsoft focused on Windows XP, which was released in 2001.
