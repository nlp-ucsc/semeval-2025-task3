The term "molecular biology" was coined by **Warren Weaver** in 1938. At the time, Weaver was the director of the Natural Sciences Division of the Rockefeller Foundation. He used this term to describe the intersection of biology and the physical sciences, particularly focusing on the study of biological molecules and their interactions. This marked an important shift towards understanding biological processes at the molecular level, which has since become a cornerstone of modern biological research.
