The physician who first identified cerebral palsy was **William John Little**. An English surgeon, Little described a condition he termed "cerebral palsy" in the 1860s, specifically in 1861. He presented a paper titled "On the Nature and Treatment of the Costs of the Spine and Clubfoot" to the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society, where he detailed the condition.

However, it's important to note that while Little is often credited with the first formal description of cerebral palsy, earlier references to similar conditions can be found in historical medical texts. For example, the works of **Hippocrates** (460â€“370 BCE) contained descriptions of children with movement disorders that might align with what we now recognize as cerebral palsy.

But the modern understanding and classification of cerebral palsy as a distinct medical condition are attributed to **Freddie (Fred) Robert** and **Sigmund Freud**, who provided more comprehensive descriptions and classifications in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, respectively. Robert coined the term "cerebral palsy" in the 1950s, and Freud's work in 1897 further advanced the understanding of the condition.

In summary, while **William John Little** is often recognized as the physician who first formally described cerebral palsy, the term and modern understanding were later developed by others.
