Daler Mehndi, the popular Indian singer and musician, faced legal action in 2003 when he and his brother, Shamsher Mehndi, were accused of illegally trafficking individuals from Punjab to the United States, Canada, and other countries. The charges stemmed from allegations that they were involved in a human trafficking ring that promised individuals jobs, Lottery visas, or other opportunities abroad but instead exploited them for financial gain.

The case against Daler Mehndi included charges under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, such as cheating, forgery, and human trafficking. He was initially arrested in 2003 and later granted bail. The legal proceedings were lengthy, and in 2018, he was convicted by a court in Patiala, Punjab, for his role in the trafficking case. However, he was sentenced to two years in jail, but considering the time he had already spent in custody and other factors, he was released on bail.

It is important to note that Daler Mehndi maintained his innocence throughout the ordeal and filed appeals against the conviction. The case highlighted issues related to illegal immigration and the exploitation of individuals seeking better opportunities abroad. The exact details and outcomes of the legal action can vary, and it is advisable to consult official legal documents or reliable news sources for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
