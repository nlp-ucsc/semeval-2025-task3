The concept of adult suffrage in the Indian Constitution is defined under **Article 326**. This article states that every person who is a citizen of India and is 18 years of age or older has the right to vote in any election to the Lok Sabha or the state legislative assemblies, subject to other qualifications and conditions laid down by the Constitution or by law. This provision ensures that all adults, regardless of gender, caste, religion, or property ownership, are granted the right to vote. 

It's important to note that prior to 1974, the voting age was 21, but it was reduced to 18 years through the 61st Amendment Act, 1988, reflecting the nation's commitment to expanding democratic participation among its citizens. Thus, Article 326 is a cornerstone of India's electoral system, upholding the principle of universal adult franchise.
