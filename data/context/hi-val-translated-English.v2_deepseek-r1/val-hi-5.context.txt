A normal human birth, also known as labor, consists of three main stages. Here's a brief overview of each stage:

1. **First Stage of Labor**: This stage is further divided into three phases:
   - **Early Labor**: Contractions begin and become more frequent, causing the cervix to dilate and efface (thin out).
   - **Active Labor**: Contractions are stronger and closer together, leading to more rapid dilation and preparation for delivery.
   - **Transition**: The most intense phase, where contractions are very strong and frequent, preparing the mother to start pushing.

2. **Second Stage of Labor**: This stage begins once the cervix is fully dilated (10 cm). The mother will feel a strong urge to push with each contraction, helping the baby move through the birth canal and be delivered.

3. **Third Stage of Labor**: This final stage involves the delivery of the placenta after the baby has been born. It is a shorter stage compared to the first two but is crucial for ensuring all placental tissue is expelled to prevent complications.

Each stage has distinct characteristics and purposes, working together to bring about a successful delivery.
