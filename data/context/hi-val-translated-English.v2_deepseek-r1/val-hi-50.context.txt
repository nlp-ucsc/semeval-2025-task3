Jamnagar was founded in 1540 by Jam Rawal, a Rajput chieftain. The city was established near the ancient settlement of Nawanagar. Jam Rawal was a descendant of the Jadeja Rajputs and named the city after himself, calling it Jamnagar, which translates to "the city of Jam." Over time, the city became a major center in the region, known for its historical significance, cultural heritage, and as an important hub for the princely state of Nawanagar during the British Raj era.
