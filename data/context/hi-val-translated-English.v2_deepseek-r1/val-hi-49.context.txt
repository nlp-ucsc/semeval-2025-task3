As of my last update in July 2024, there is no widely recognized star by the name "Beta giraffe star." It's possible that this could be a nickname or a less commonly known designation for a star, but without more specific information, I cannot provide details about its rotational speed.

If you have more context or if this refers to a specific star in a particular constellation or system, please provide additional details, and I'd be happy to help further! For accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend consulting a recent astronomical database or research publication.
