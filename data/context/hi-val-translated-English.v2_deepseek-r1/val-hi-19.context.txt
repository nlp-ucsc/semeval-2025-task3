The Caliphate of C贸rdoba was ruled by the Umayyad dynasty. The Umayyads established their caliphate in C贸rdoba, Spain, after the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate in Damascus in 750 CE. Abd al-Rahman I became the first Umayyad emir of C贸rdoba in 756 CE, and the caliphate reached its peak during the reign of Abd al-Rahman III in the 10th century. The Umayyad Caliphate of C贸rdoba lasted until 1031 CE, when it fragmented into smaller kingdoms known as taifas.
