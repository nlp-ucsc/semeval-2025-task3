Syrian Christians are some of the oldest Christian communities in the world.[qb kidding me? No, just explaining.] They traditionally speak Syriac, a dialect of Middle Aramaic that was once the lingua franca of the region. Over time, many have shifted to speaking the dominant languages of their countries, such as Arabic in the Middle East or Malayalam in Kerala, India, where a significant community resides. However, liturgical services and religious chants are still conducted in Syriac to preserve their rich cultural and religious heritage.
