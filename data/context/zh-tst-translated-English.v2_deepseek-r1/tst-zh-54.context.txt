The legends of the Jomsvikings are primarily recorded in several medieval Icelandic manuscripts, known as sagas, which were written in the 12th to 14th centuries. These texts are some of the most important sources for understanding the history and culture of the Viking Age. Below are the key historical sources that mention the Jomsvikings:
