The pygmy right whale (Caperea marginata) is the smallest species of right whale and is found in the southern parts of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. It was first described as a species by the British zoologist Gray in 1846. However, it was initially documented based on a specimen found in South Africa in 1775, but at the time, it was mistakenly identified as a young gray whale. The correct identification and classification as a distinct species came in 1872 when a skull was discovered near New Zealand. Therefore, while the pygmy right whale has been encountered since the 18th century, its recognition as a separate species occurred in the 19th century.
