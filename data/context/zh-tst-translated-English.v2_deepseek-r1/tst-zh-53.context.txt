4. **"Ashik-Kerib" (1988)**: Based on a story by Mikhail Lermontov, this film tells the tale of a wandering minstrel (ashik) and his search for his beloved, incorporating stunning visuals and poetic storytelling.

5. **"The Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors" (1964)**: Parajanov's first major film, it’s set in the Carpathian Mountains and tells a haunting tale of doomed love between two families, blending folklore with lyrical imagery.
