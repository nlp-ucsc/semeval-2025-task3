I'm not familiar with a football club called the Helsinki Football Club, and I couldn't find any specific information on their traditional jersey colors. If you're referring to a well-known team from Helsinki, it might be HIFK, which is a sports club with a football section. HIFK's traditional colors are red and white. However, if you meant a different club, please provide more details, and I'll do my best to assist!
