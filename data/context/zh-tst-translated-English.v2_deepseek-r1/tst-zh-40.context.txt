The term "Anglo-Irish" refers to the people of mixed English and Irish ancestry, particularly those who historically belonged to the Anglo-Norman and English families that settled in Ireland, especially after the Norman invasion in the late 12th century. Over time, these settlers developed a distinct cultural identity that was influenced by both English and Irish traditions.

The Anglo-Irish were often associated with the Protestant Anglo-Irish ruling class, particularly the landed gentry and aristocracy, who dominated Irish political and social life up until the 20th century. They played a significant role in Irish history, including during the period of British rule in Ireland.

In a broader sense, the term can also be used to describe anyone of mixed English and Irish heritage or someone who has strong connections to both cultures.

It's worth noting that the term can sometimes carry different connotations depending on the context, especially in discussions about Irish history and identity.
