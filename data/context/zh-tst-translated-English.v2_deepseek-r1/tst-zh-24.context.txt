The Brown-headed Crow (*Corvus fuscicapillus*) is primarily found in the mountainous regions of **Papua New Guinea**. These birds typically inhabit **montane forests** and **subalpine grasslands** at elevations between **2,000 to 3,000 meters above sea level**. They are highly adaptable and can also be seen in **forest edges** and **clearings**, where they forage for insects, fruits, and small vertebrates. Their preference for cooler, high-altitude environments makes them well-suited to the rugged terrains of Papua New Guinea.
