University College Cork (UCC) has had several names throughout its history. It was originally established in 1845 as one of three Queen's Colleges in Ireland, alongside Queen's College Belfast and Queen's College Galway. These institutions were founded under the Queen's Colleges (Ireland) Act of 1845. While UCC is now a constituent university of the National University of Ireland, it was previously known as Queen's College, Cork.
