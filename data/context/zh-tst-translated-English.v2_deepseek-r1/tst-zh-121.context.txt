The light cruiser *Emden* was a German warship of the KÃ¶nigsberg class, built in the early 20th century and served during World War II. Here is an overview of its weaponry and equipment:

1. **Main Armament**: The *Emden* was equipped with eight 15 cm (5.9 in) SK L/45 guns arranged in single mounts. These guns were capable of firing high-explosive shells and had a range of approximately 17,600 meters.

2. **Anti-Aircraft Armament**: 
   - The ship initially had three 8.8 cm (3.46 in) SK L/45 anti-aircraft guns, which were later increased to five during World War II.
   - Additionally, it carried multiple smaller anti-aircraft weapons, including 37 mm and 20 mm guns, which were augmented as the war progressed to improve defense against aircraft.

3. **Torpedo Tubes**: The *Emden* was fitted with four 500 mm torpedo tubes, arranged in two dual-mount launchers. These were used for attacking enemy ships.

4. **Aircraft**: The cruiser was equipped with a single Heinkel He 60 biplane for reconnaissance and spotting duties. This aircraft could be launched from a catapult on the ship.

5. **Radar and Fire Control**: During World War II, the *Emden* was retrofitted with basic radar systems for air and surface surveillance, along with improved fire control systems to enhance the accuracy of its gunfire.

6. **Armor**: The ship had a protective belt of up to 60 mm (2.36 in) and armored deck up to 40 mm (1.57 in), providing moderate protection against shellfire.

7. **Propulsion**: Powered by four turbines with eight boilers, the *Emden* could achieve speeds of up to 32 knots (59.3 km/h) and had a range of about 7,000 nautical miles at 12 knots.

8. **Sensors and Electronics**: Besides radar, the ship was equipped with standard navigation and communication equipment of its time, including gyrocompasses, radio transmitters, and sonar for submarine detection.

Throughout its service, the *Emden* underwent several modifications to keep up with the evolving demands of naval warfare, especially in anti-aircraft defense.
