Chaos is a trans-Neptunian object (TNO) located in the outermost regions of the solar system, primarily in the Kuiper Belt. Here are some key physical properties of this celestial body:

1. **Orbital Characteristics**: Chaos has an eccentric orbit that is somewhat inclined relative to the plane of the solar system. It takes approximately 309 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun.

2. **Size**: Measurements suggest that Chaos has a diameter of approximately 600-700 kilometers, making it a relatively large TNO.

3. **Shape**: The shape of Chaos is likely irregular, similar to many other small bodies in the Kuiper Belt, due to its relatively small size and the effects of gravity not being sufficient to pull it into a spherical shape.

4. **Surface Composition**: Spectroscopic studies indicate that Chaos has a surface rich in water ice mixed with darker organic material, which is common among Kuiper Belt objects. This surface composition suggests that it has undergone some degree of processing due to solar irradiation or internal heating.

The physical properties provide important insights into the formation and evolution of the outer Solar System.
