Colombia's presidential term is established by the Constitution of Colombia. The key provisions are as follows:

1. **Term Length**: The President of Colombia serves a four-year term.

2. **Consecutive Re-election**: Prior to a 2015 constitutional reform, presidents were allowed to serve two consecutive terms. However, the reform under President Juan Manuel Santos introduced a change, limiting the president to a single term with no immediate re-election, though they can run again after a four-year period.

3. **Eligibility**: To be eligible for the presidency, a person must be a Colombian citizen by birth, at least 30 years old, and meet the residency requirement of having lived in Colombia the ten years prior to the election.

4. **election Process**: The president is elected by popular vote through a two-round system. If no candidate receives at least 50% of the votes in the first round, the top two candidates proceed to a runoff.

5. **Swearing-in**: The president is sworn in on August 7th, marking the beginning of the four-year term.

6. **Term Limits**: The president cannot serve more than two terms in their lifetime, and they cannot serve consecutive terms.

These provisions are designed to ensure political stability and prevent the concentration of power, reflecting Colombia's historical and legal context.
