Silkworm moth liquor, also known as "Bombyx mori liquor" or simply "silkworm liquor," is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been used for hundreds of years. It is a liquid extract derived from the excrement or vomit of silkworms that are infected by the fungus *Beauveria bassiana*, commonly known as white muscardine.

When silkworms are infected with this fungus, they typically climb to the top of mulberry trees before dying, and their bodies become covered in a white, cotton-like substance (mycelium) produced by the fungus. The infection process leads the silkworms to release a liquid substance, which is collected and processed to make silkworm moth liquor.

Silkworm moth liquor is believed to have various health benefits, including enhancing vitality, improving digestion, and boosting the immune system. It is also sometimes used to treat conditions such as indigestion, coughs, and respiratory issues. However, it's important to note that these claims have not been scientifically verified, and the effectiveness of silkworm moth liquor is largely based on traditional use rather than modern medical research.

This liquor has a strong odor and a bitter taste, and it is often consumed in small amounts diluted with water or added to other beverages. Despite its popularity in some regions, it is not widely known or used globally, and its availability may be limited to certain areas where traditional Chinese medicine is commonly practiced.
