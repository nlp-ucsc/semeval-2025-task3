The Chuseok festival, also known as Korean Thanksgiving Day, has its origins in the harvest rituals of Korea's agricultural past. It is celebrated on the 15th day of the 8th lunar month, which typically falls in late September or early October. The festival is rooted in the traditional practice of harvest thanksgiving and the honoring of ancestors.

Historically, Chuseok was a time when farmers would gather their harvest and express gratitude for the fruits of their labor. This was also a period when people would return to their hometowns to visit their families and pay respects to their ancestors through ritual ceremonies, known as "charye." These rituals involved the preparation of traditional foods such as songpyeon (half-moon-shaped rice cakes), which symbolize abundance and the unity of family.

The festival has deep cultural and historical significance, reflecting the importance of filial piety and communal celebration in Korean society. Over time, Chuseok has evolved to incorporate various traditional activities, including folk games, family gatherings, and the sharing of food, but its core traditions of thanksgiving and honoring ancestors remain central to the celebration.
