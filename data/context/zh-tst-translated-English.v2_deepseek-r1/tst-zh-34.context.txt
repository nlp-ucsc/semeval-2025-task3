Mount Augustus is located in Western Australia, approximately 805 kilometers (500 miles) northeast of Perth. It sits within the Mount Augustus National Park in the Mid West region of the state. This mountain is known for being one of the largest monoliths in the world, even larger than Uluru (Ayers Rock), although it is not as widely known. It holds significant cultural importance for the local Indigenous peoples, the Wadjari.
