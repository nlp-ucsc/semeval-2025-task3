Observational cosmology is the study of the universe on its largest scales through the collection and analysis of observational data. Establishing a robust framework in observational cosmology involves several key steps and components, which can be broken down into the following process:

1. **Formulation of Theoretical Models**: 
   - The foundation of observational cosmology begins with theoretical models that describe the universe. These models, such as the Big Bang theory, inflation, or dark energy models, provide predictions about the structure, composition, and evolution of the universe.
   - These theories are often based on fundamental physics, such as general relativity, quantum mechanics, and particle physics, and are used to make predictions that can be tested with observations.

2. **Development of Observational Programs**:
   - Once theoretical predictions are established, observational programs are designed to collect data that can test these predictions.
   - Observational programs involve choosing the appropriate astronomical objects, phenomena, or features to observe, such as supernovae, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), galaxy clusters, or the large-scale structure of the universe.
   - The choice of what to observe is driven by the specific questions being asked and the predictions of the theoretical models.

3. **Selection and Development of Instruments and Surveys**:
   - To carry out the observational programs, appropriate instruments and surveys must be selected or developed.
   - This includes a wide range of astronomical instruments, such as ground-based telescopes (e.g., Keck, Subaru), space-based telescopes (e.g., Hubble, James Webb), radio telescopes (e.g., Atacama Large Millimeter Array - ALMA), or specialized instruments like gravitational wave detectors (e.g., LIGO).
   - Large-scale surveys, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), or the Euclid mission, are designed to collect vast amounts of data on specific phenomena.

4. **Data Collection**:
   - The actual process of collecting data is a critical phase. This involves making observations with the selected instruments and surveys, often over extended periods of time.
   - The data collected can include images, spectra, light curves, redshift measurements, or other forms of astronomical information, depending on the target of the observation.

5. **Data Processing and Reduction**:
   - After collecting the raw data, it must be processed and reduced to a usable form. This involves calibration, correction for instrumental effects, noise reduction, and other data cleaning techniques.
   - The data is often transformed into more usable forms, such as catalogs of galaxy positions, redshifts, or photometric measurements.

6. **Data Analysis**:
   - The processed data is then analyzed to extract meaningful information and to test theoretical predictions.
   - This can involve statistical analysis, comparison with simulations, and the application of various cosmological models to the data.
   - Observational cosmologists use a variety of techniques, such as measuring the distance-redshift relation, determining the matter power spectrum, or analyzing the angular power spectrum of the CMB.

7. **Comparison with Theoretical Predictions**:
   - The results from the data analysis are compared with the predictions of theoretical models. This comparison can lead to the validation of existing models, the refinement of models, or the need for entirely new theories.
   - Discrepancies between observations and theory can drive further research, leading to revisions in our understanding of the universe.

8. **Refinement of Theoretical Models**:
   - Based on the comparison between observations and theory, theoretical models are refined or new models are developed.
   - This iterative process between theory and observation is a cornerstone of scientific progress in cosmology.
