In Chinese Buddhist tradition, Dharma names and titles are typically chosen based on Buddhist scriptures and the teachings of the Buddha, reflecting the principles of Buddhism and the cultivation of the mind. These names and titles are meant to inspire and guide practitioners on their spiritual path. The specific customs for choosing Dharma names and titles can vary depending on the Buddhist sect and the master who confers them. Generally, they are selected to represent the qualities of Buddhist teachings and to encourage the cultivation of wisdom and compassion.
