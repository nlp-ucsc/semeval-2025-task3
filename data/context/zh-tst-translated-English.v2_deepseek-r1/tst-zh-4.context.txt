The British Academy Film Awards, popularly known as the BAFTAs, have a long history, and the specific details about the number of nominations for the Best Supporting Actor category in different years is not something I can provide in real-time. However, I can suggest some ways you can find this information:

1. **BAFTA Official Website**: The BAFTA website likely has archives of past nominations and winners. You can visit their official website and explore the historical data section.

2. **IMDb**: IMDb often has comprehensive lists of nominees and winners for various awards, including the BAFTAs. You can search for each year's BAFTA Awards and look at the Best Supporting Actor category.

3. **Wikipedia**: Many BAFTA ceremonies have dedicated Wikipedia pages that list nominees and winners. You can navigate to the specific year's BAFTA page and check the Best Supporting Actor section.

4. **Entertainment News Websites**: Websites like Variety, The Guardian, or The Telegraph often cover the BAFTAs extensively. You can search their archives for articles about past ceremonies.

If you need specific years or more detailed information, it might be best to consult these resources directly. Let me know if you'd like guidance on how to use any of these sources!
