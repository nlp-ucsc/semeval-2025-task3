The eye socket, also known as the **orbit**, is the bony cavity in the skull that contains and protects the eye and its associated structures. It serves as a protective compartment for the eyeball, eye muscles, nerves, blood vessels, and adipose tissue that support and enable the eye's functions. The orbit is located on each side of the face and is a key anatomical feature that ensures the eye is properly positioned and safeguarded.
