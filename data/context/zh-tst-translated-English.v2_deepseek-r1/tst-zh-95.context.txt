The Griseus mullet (*Mugil grisolepis*) is not a recognized species in the most recent taxonomic classifications. However, if you are referring to a species commonly known as Griseus mullet, it might be a local name or a synonym for another mullet species.

Mullet species are generally found in warm and temperate waters around the world, including the Mediterranean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, and the Indian Ocean. They often inhabit coastal areas, estuaries, and sometimes venture into freshwater environments.

For more precise information, could you clarify which specific species you are referring to or provide more context? This would help in giving a more accurate answer.
