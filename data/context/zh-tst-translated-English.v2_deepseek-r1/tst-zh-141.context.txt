The Battle of Long Island, also known as the Battle of Brooklyn, took place on August 27, 1776, during the American Revolutionary War. It was a significant engagement between British forces under the command of General William Howe and Continental Army forces led by General George Washington. The British commanders and leaders in this battle included:

1. **General William Howe**: As the overall commander of British forces, General Howe was instrumental in planning and executing the strategy that led to the British victory. His brother, Admiral Richard Howe, commanded the British naval forces supporting the operation.

2. **General Charles Cornwallis**: He played a crucial role in the battle, leading a flanking maneuver that caught the Continental Army off guard and contributed to their eventual retreat.

3. **General Henry Clinton**: Clinton was another key commander who contributed to the British strategy. His contingent executed a diversionary attack that distracted the Continental forces while the main assault was launched elsewhere.

4. **General Hugh Percy**: Percy led a brigade during the battle and was notable for his role in reinforcing the British lines during the engagement.

These leaders effectively coordinated their forces to achieve a decisive victory, which allowed the British to capture New York City, a strategic location they held for the remainder of the war. Despite the defeat, General Washington successfully evacuated his troops to Manhattan, demonstrating his leadership and strategic thinking under pressure.
