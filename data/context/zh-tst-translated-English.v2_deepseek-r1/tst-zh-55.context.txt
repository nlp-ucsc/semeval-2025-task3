The 2013 Iranian presidential election was held on June 14, 2013, and was the eleventh presidential election in Iran. The background to this election was marked by several significant factors:

1. **Outgoing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad**: Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had served two consecutive terms as President of Iran since 2005, was ineligible to run for a third term due to term limits set by the Iranian Constitution. His presidency was controversial, both domestically and internationally, particularly due to his hardline stance on nuclear development, his denial of the Holocaust, and his handling of the economy.

2. **Political Landscape**: The political landscape in Iran is dominated by conservative and moderate factions within the ruling Islamic Republican Party. The election saw a field of candidates approved by the Guardian Council, a powerful body that vets candidates based on their loyalty to the Islamic Republic and its principles.

3. **Nuclear Program and Sanctions**: Iran's nuclear program was a major issue during the election. The country faced stringent economic sanctions imposed by the international community, led by the United States and its allies, over concerns about the potential military dimensions of the nuclear program. The sanctions had a significant impact on Iran's economy, leading to high inflation, unemployment, and a devalued currency.

4. **Economic Crisis**: The Iranian economy was in crisis, with high inflation, rising unemployment, and a significant decline in the standard of living for many citizens. The economic situation was a major concern for voters, with candidates promising to address these issues.

5. **Domestic Politics**: The election was also influenced by internal political dynamics. The conservative establishment, led by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, sought to maintain control over the government. Reformists and moderates hoped to regain influence after being marginalized following the disputed 2009 presidential election, which led to widespread protests known as the "Green Movement."

6. **Candidates**: Several candidates ran in the election, but the field was narrowed down by the Guardian Council's vetting process. Key candidates included:
   - **Hassan Rouhani**: A moderate cleric and former nuclear negotiator who advocated for a more pragmatic approach to international relations and economic reform.
   - **Mohammed Baqher Ghalibaf**: The mayor of Tehran and a conservative figure with a background in the Revolutionary Guards.
   - **Saeed Jalili**: A hardline conservative and chief nuclear negotiator, known for his tough stance on the nuclear issue.
   - **Mohammad Reza Aref**: A reformist candidate who later withdrew from the race, likely to consolidate support for Rouhani.

7. **Supreme Leader's Influence**: The Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, holds significant power in Iran and played a crucial role in shaping the election. He sought to ensure that the next president would align with his policies and maintain the stability of the regime.

8. **International Relations**: The election was closely watched internationally, particularly regarding Iran's stance on its nuclear program and its relations with the West. The election of a more moderate candidate was seen as a potential opening for renewed negotiations on the nuclear issue.

In summary, the 2013 Iranian presidential election took place against the backdrop of economic hardship, international sanctions, a contentious nuclear program, and a complex domestic political landscape. The election marked a significant shift with the victory of Hassan Rouhani, who campaigned on promises of moderation and economic reform, potentially signaling a new direction for Iran's domestic and foreign policies.
