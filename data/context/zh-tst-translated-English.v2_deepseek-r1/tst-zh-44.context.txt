The Ploceidae, commonly known as weavers, are a family of small, passerine birds that are native to Africa and Eurasia. Their distribution varies depending on the species, but they generally inhabit regions with warm, temperate, or tropical climates.

Some of the key regions where weaver birds can be found include:

1. Sub-Saharan Africa: This is the primary habitat for the majority of weaver species. Countries such as South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, and Nigeria are home to a diverse range of weaver species.

2. Southern Asia: Weaver birds are also found in parts of southern Asia, including India, Southeast Asia, and the Philippines.

3. The Middle East: Some species of weavers extend into the Middle Eastern region, particularly in areas with suitable habitats.

4. parts of Europe: A few species, like the European Weaver (Ploceus cucullatus), can occasionally be found in southern Europe, particularly in regions like Spain, Portugal, and parts of France.

Weaver birds typically live in a variety of habitats, including savannas, grasslands, and backyards with trees, as long as there is a reliable source of water nearby. Their ability to adapt to different environments has allowed them to spread across these regions and establish significant populations.
