At the 2012 London Summer Olympics, significant competition rules were introduced to enhance the fairness and transparency of the taekwondo events, including the women's over 67 kg category. The key new rule adopted was the use of electronic scoring systems, specifically the Daedo Gen 2 scoring equipment. This system incorporated electronic hogus (chest protectors) and headgear, automatically registering scores when a technique was executed with sufficient force. Additionally, there were detailed video review systems implemented, allowing referees to review controversial points or scoring decisions, thereby reducing human error and ensuring accurate results. These changes were part of broader efforts to modernize the sport and improve its spectator appeal.
