Bahram I, who ruled the Sassanian Empire from 273 to 276 CE, executed Mani, the founder of Manichaeism, primarily due to religious and political reasons. Manichaeism was a syncretistic religion that combined elements of Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Buddhism, and it gained a significant following across the empire. This expansion posed a threat to the established Zoroastrian clergy, who saw Manichaeism as a heresy and a challenge to their authority.

Bahram I was firmly aligned with the Zoroastrian priesthood, which had significant influence over the Sassanian state. The priests viewed Mani's teachings as a direct threat to their religious and political power. Additionally, Manichaeism's universalist message and proselytizing efforts were seen as subversive to the empire's stability, as it could undermine the traditional structures of society.

Therefore, under pressure from the Zoroastrian clergy, Bahram I ordered the execution of Mani in 276 CE. This act was both a religious and political move to maintain the dominance of Zoroastrianism and to preserve the empire's social order.
