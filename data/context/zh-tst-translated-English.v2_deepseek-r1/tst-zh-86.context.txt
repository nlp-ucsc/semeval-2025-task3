The Church of San Isidro in Madrid, Spain, was constructed during the 17th century. The historical background of its construction is deeply rooted in the Counter-Reformation and the Baroque period in Spain. The church was commissioned by King Philip II, who sought to promote the Catholic faith in response to the Protestant movement sweeping across Europe. San Isidro was chosen as the patron saint due to his significance as a local Madrid saint. The church was built over the remains of an earlier chapel where San Isidro was buried, and it symbolized the reinforcement of Catholicism in Spain. The construction reflected the grandiose architectural style of the era, emphasizing elaborate decoration and spatial grandeur, which were hallmarks of Baroque architecture. The church became a testament to the Kingdom of Spain's religious and cultural identity during that time.
