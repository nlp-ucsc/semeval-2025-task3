El Al Flight 402 was an international passenger flight operated by El Al, the flag carrier of Israel, that crashed on July 27, 1955. The flight was scheduled to fly from Vienna, Austria, to Tel Aviv, Israel, with a stopover in Istanbul, Turkey. The aircraft involved was a Lockheed L-049 Constellation, registered as 4X-AKC.

The flight departed Vienna and proceeded towards Istanbul. After taking off from Vienna International Airport, the aircraft encountered severe thunderstorms. As it approached Istanbul, the crew attempted to land at Istanbul Yeşilköy Airport (now Istanbul Atatürk Airport). However, during the approach, the aircraft strayed into Bulgarian airspace due to navigational errors and adverse weather conditions.

Bulgarian air defenses, at the time, were on high alert due to the Cold War tensions. The aircraft was intercepted and mistakenly identified as a Western military plane. Bulgarian MiG-15 fighter jets were scrambled, and they shot down the El Al Constellation. The aircraft crashed near the town of Petrich in southwestern Bulgaria, close to the Greek border.

Tragically, all 51 passengers and 7 crew members on board were killed in the crash. The incident caused a significant international crisis, with Israel and other countries demanding explanations and reparations from Bulgaria. The Bulgarian government eventually acknowledged that its forces had shot down the plane, attributing it to a case of mistaken identity during a period of heightened military alertness.

This incident led to changes in international aviation protocols to prevent similar tragedies in the future, particularly regarding communication and identification procedures between civilian aircraft and military authorities. It remains one of the most significant aviation disasters in Israeli history and a poignant reminder of the risks and complexities of international air travel during the Cold War era.
