The Alemanni, an early Germanic tribe, are first mentioned in historical records around the 3rd century AD. Here are the key sources:

1. **Latin Historians**: The Roman historian Cassius Dio (circa 155-235 AD) is the first to mention the Alemanni in his work *Roman History*. He describes them as a group of Germanic peoples who revolted against Roman rule.

2. **Ami**an**us Marcellinus**: A later Roman historian, Ammianus Marcellinus (circa 330-395 AD), provides detailed accounts of the Alemanni in his *Res Gestae*. He highlights their military prowess and interactions with the Roman Empire.

3. **Archaeological Evidence**: Excavations have uncovered artifacts and settlements from the Alemanni period, offering insights into their culture, economy, and social structure.

4. **Notitia Dignitatum**: This late Roman document lists military units and administrative structures, including references to Alemannic forces within the Empire.

These sources collectively paint a picture of the Alemanni as a significant power in Late Antiquity, influencing both the Roman Empire and the subsequent development of medieval Europe.
