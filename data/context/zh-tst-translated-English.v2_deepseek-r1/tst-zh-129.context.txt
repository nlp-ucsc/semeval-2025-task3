Emperor Uda of Japan, who reigned from 887 to 897, favored several individuals who played significant roles during the Kanpyō era (889-898). This period is notable for attempts at imperial reform and the strengthening of the emperor's authority, which had been waning in favor of the powerful Fujiwara regents.

One of the key individuals Emperor Uda favored was his son, Emperor Daigo, whom he designated as his successor. Emperor Uda's decision to promote Daigo was part of his efforts to ensure a stable succession and to prevent the Fujiwara clan from exerting excessive influence over the throne.

Another important figure was Sugawara no Michizane, a prominent scholar, poet, and statesman. Emperor Uda appointed Michizane to significant political roles, seeing him as a potential ally in his efforts to counterbalance the power of the Fujiwara. Michizane's abilities as an administrator and his literary talents made him a valuable asset to the emperor's reforms.

Additionally, Emperor Uda sought to reinforce imperial authority by promoting officials who were directly loyal to him, bypassing the traditional Fujiwara-dominated bureaucratic structures. This strategy aimed to restore some of the emperor's political power that had been eroded over the years.

In summary, Emperor Uda favored individuals like Emperor Daigo and Sugawara no Michizane, as well as other loyal officials, as part of his broader strategy toassert imperial control and implement reforms during the Kanpyō era. These appointments and policies reflected his attempts to address the challenges posed by the dominant Fujiwara clan and to revitalize the imperial system.
