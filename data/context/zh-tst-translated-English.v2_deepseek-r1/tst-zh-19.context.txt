The term "factions of collage" isn't commonly used, so I might need a bit more context to provide an accurate answer. However, I can interpret it in a couple of ways:

1. **Factions in a Collage Metaphor**: If you're using "collage" as a metaphor for a group or community divided into smaller groups with different interests or goals, then the "factions" would be the subgroups within that larger collective. For example, in a community or organization, factions might form around different ideologies, priorities, or strategies.

2. **Collage as an Art Form**: If you're referring to collage as an art form, "factions" could metaphorically represent different styles, movements, or techniques within the medium. For instance, collage can be divided into factions like:
   - **Surrealist Collage**: Often includes dream-like, fantastical imagery.
   - **Political or activist collage**: Focuses on conveying social or political messages.
   - **Abstract Collage**: Prioritizes form, color, and texture over representational imagery.
   - **Pop Art Collage**: Incorporates elements of popular culture and consumerism.

3. **Collage as a Game or Story Setting**: If "collage" is part of a game, story, or fictional universe, the factions could be groups or organizations with specific roles or rivalries. For example, in a role-playing game, factions might include different clans, guilds, or factions vying for power.

Could you clarify what you mean by "collage" in this context? That way, I can give a more precise answer!
