Gene pleiotropy refers to the phenomenon where a single gene influences multiple, seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits. In other words, one gene can affect multiple characteristics of an organism. This occurs because the gene's product, such as a protein, may be involved in various biochemical pathways or processes within the organism, leading to diverse effects. Pleiotropy is a key concept in genetics and evolutionary biology, as it highlights the complexity of gene function and the interconnectedness of different traits in an organism.
