An egg-shaped curve, often referred to as an **ellipse**, is a type of conic section formed by all the points in a plane such that the sum of their distances from two fixed points (called foci) is constant. This results in a symmetric, stretched, or compressed circular shape. Depending on its orientation, it can resemble an egg, with one longer and one shorter axis.

### Key Features:
1. **Symmetry**: Ellipses are symmetric about both their major and minor axes.
2. **Foci**: There are two points inside the ellipse (along the major axis) that define the shape.
3. **Major Axis**: The longer diameter of the ellipse.
4. **Minor Axis**: The shorter diameter.
5. **Eccentricity**: A measure of how elongated the ellipse is, ranging from 0 (a circle) to 1 (a highly elongated shape).

### Mathematical Representation:
The standard equation of an ellipse centered at the origin is:

\[ \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \]

- \(a\) is the semi-major axis (half of the major axis).
- \(b\) is the semi-minor axis (half of the minor axis).

If \(a > b\), the major axis is along the x-axis, and if \(b > a\), itâ€™s along the y-axis.

### Examples of Egg-Shaped Curves:
- **Circles**: A special case where \(a = b\).
- **Oval Shapes**: Often used in design and everyday objects.
- **Planetary Orbits**: Many planets orbit their stars in elliptical paths.

In summary, an egg-shaped curve, or ellipse, is a closed, symmetrical curve with two foci, characterized by its major and minor axes, providing a wide range of applications in mathematics, physics, and art.
