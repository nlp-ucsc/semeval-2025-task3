The Zimbabwe 2008 election, which was held on March 29, 2008, was a significant political event in the country's history. The election included both parliamentary and presidential contests, with multiple candidates vying for positions. 

In the presidential election, the main candidates were Robert Mugabe, the incumbent President and leader of the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), and Simba Makoni, an independent candidate. 

According to the official results announced by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC), Morgan Tsvangirai received the most votes in the first round, with approximately 47.9%, while Robert Mugabe garnered around 43.2%, and Simba Makoni received about 8.3%. Since no candidate secured an outright majority (which requires more than 50% of the vote), a runoff election was scheduled between Tsvangirai and Mugabe.

However, the runoff was marred by widespread violence and intimidation, primarily against supporters of the MDC. Morgan Tsvangirai withdrew from the runoff on June 22, 2008, citing the violent environment and the unfair conditions under which the election was being conducted. Consequently, Robert Mugabe was declared the winner by the ZEC, with 85.9% of the votes, in an election that was widely condemned by the international community as not being free and fair.

The parliamentary election saw the MDC, combined with its splinter faction, winning a majority in the House of Assembly. However, due to the political turmoil and disputes over the legitimacy of the elections, Zimbabwe entered a period of political instability and negotiations. Eventually, under significant regional and international pressure, a power-sharing agreement was reached in September 2008, leading to the formation of a Government of National Unity in February 2009, with Morgan Tsvangirai becoming the Prime Minister and Robert Mugabe retaining the Presidency.

This outcome marked a significant shift in Zimbabwe's political landscape, though challenges related to governance, human rights, and economic stability persisted.
