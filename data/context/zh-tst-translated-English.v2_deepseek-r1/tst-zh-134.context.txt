As of my last update in July 2024, Amecourt is a commune in the Eure department in the Normandy region of northern France. To determine which provinces border Amecourt, it's important to understand that France no longer uses "provinces" in the historical sense but is divided into "départements."

Amecourt is located in the Eure department. The neighboring departments (formerly part of the provinces of Normandy) that border Eure include:

1. Seine-Maritime to the west and northwest.
2. Oise to the east.
3. Val-d'Oise to the east (though only a small part).
4. Yvelines to the southeast.
5. Eure-et-Loir to the south.
6. Orne to the west.

These departments are part of the Normandy and Île-de-France regions. For more precise information, you might need to consult a detailed map of the area. Let me know if you'd like further clarification!
