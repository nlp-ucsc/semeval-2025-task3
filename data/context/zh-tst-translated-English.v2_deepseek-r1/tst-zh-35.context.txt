The Shared Source Initiative was launched by Microsoft in 2006 as part of its broader strategy to engage with the open-source software community. The initiative allowed for the release of the source code of some Microsoft products under modified terms, with the aim of fostering collaboration and transparency while maintaining intellectual property protections. It included various licensing programs such as the Microsoft Reference Source License (MS-RSL) and the Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL). This initiative was an important step for Microsoft in embracing open-source principles and expanding its collaboration with developers outside the company.
