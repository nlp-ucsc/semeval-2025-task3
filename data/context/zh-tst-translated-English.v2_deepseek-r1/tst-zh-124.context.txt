The fat-lip fish, known scientifically as *Oreoleuciscus potanini*, is primarily distributed in the river basins of China. It is commonly found in the Yangtze River basin, which is one of the most significant river systems in the country. Additionally, the fat-lip fish can also be found in other river basins within China, including the Yellow River basin and parts of the Pearl River basin. These river basins provide the appropriate aquatic habitats and ecological conditions necessary for the survival and proliferation of this species.
