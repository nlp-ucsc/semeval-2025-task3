International Klein Blue, also known as IKB, is a unique shade of blue pigment that was developed by the French artist Yves Klein in collaboration with the chemist Edouard Adam in the early 1950s. Klein was known for his monochromatic paintings, and he sought to create a specific, intense blue that would convey a sense of the infinite and the spiritual.

### Development and Synthesis:

1. **Collaboration with Edouard Adam:**
   Yves Klein approached the chemist Edouard Adam to help him create a synthetic binder that could suspend a high concentration of pigment while maintaining the vibrant color. The goal was to achieve a deep, luminous blue that traditional paints couldn't fully capture.

2. **Synthetic Binder:**
   Adam and Klein developed a synthetic resin called "polyvinyl acetate" mixed with other chemicals. This binder was particularly effective at holding a large amount of pigment without becoming too brittle or losing its adhesive properties.

3. **Pigment Selection:**
   The key to IKB's intense color lies in the pigment itself. Klein used a powdered ultramarine blue pigment, which was
