In Greek mythology, Aloiadae refers to the twin giants known as Ephialtes and Otus. They were the sons of the Titan Ixion and a cloud nymph named Dia. The name "Aloiadae" means "sons of Aloeus," but this is a misnomer since their father was actually Ixion. However, they were sometimes referred to as the Aloeidae because they were raised by Aloeus, the husband of Ixion's wife.

The story of the Aloiadae is significant as they were known for their enormous size and strength, typical of the Giants in Greek mythology. One of their most notable deeds was their attempted assault on Mount Olympus, the divine home of the gods, in an act of hubris and defiance. They attempted to stack mountains upon each other to reach the heavens, aiming to overthrow the Olympian gods. According to legend, they piled Mount Pelion on top of Mount Ossa in their attempt to climb to the heavens, a clear act of rebellion against the divine order.

Their actions caught the attention of the gods, and as punishment, they were killed by Apollo, often at the instigation of the other gods. The Aloiadae also had a reputation for being cruel and violent towards both gods and mortals alike, which further solidified their place as formidable antagonists in Greek myths.

It's important to note that while the Aloiadae are generally referred to as Ephialtes and Otus, there are variations in different sources and traditions, and their story can vary slightly depending on the specific myths being referenced. Nonetheless, their attempted assault on Mount Olympus and their subsequent punishment remain central to their narrative in Greek mythology.
