The Alpine zone refers to high-elevation regions found in mountainous areas around the world. These regions are typically above the tree line, where the climate is too harsh for trees to grow. The Alpine zone is characterized by low temperatures, strong winds, and short growing seasons. Vegetation in this zone is limited to grasses, mosses, and small shrubs that can survive these extreme conditions.

Some of the key areas included in the Alpine zone are:

1. **Mountain Peaks**: High-altitude peaks such as those found in the Rocky Mountains, the Andes, the Himalayas, and the European Alps.

2. **Subarctic Regions**: Areas just below the Arctic tundra, like parts of northern Canada, Alaska, and Siberia, which have an Alpine-like climate and vegetation.

3. **High plateaus**: Elevated plateaus that are flat or gently sloping but are at high enough altitudes to be above the tree line.

4. **Glacial Areas**: Regions affected by glaciers and glacial activity, where the soil is poor and only hardy, low-growing plants can survive.

These areas are unique because they support a specific set of flora and fauna adapted to the harsh conditions of the Alpine environment.
