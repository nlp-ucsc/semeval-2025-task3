Okay, so I need to figure out the largest ethnic group in Katsina State. Let me start by looking through the search results provided.

First, I see that result [1] from Wikipedia mentions that the Hausa people are the largest ethnic group in Katsina State, with minorities including Fulani and non-indigene groups. It also talks about the religious demographics, but that's not directly relevant here.

Result [3] from iNaturalist also states that the Hausa people are the main ethnic group, alongside the Fulani. It adds that Katsina was one of the largest Hausa city-states, which gives some historical context about their presence there.

Looking at result [4] from ZODML, it again confirms that Hausa and Fulani are the main ethnic groups, with other minorities like Maguwazawa, Yoruba, and Igbo. This reinforces the idea that Hausa is the largest group.

Result [2] and [5] are about population statistics but don't specifically mention ethnic groups, so they're not as helpful for this particular question.

Putting it all together, all the relevant sources consistently point to the Hausa people being the largest ethnic group in Katsina State. The Fulani are also present but as a minority. There are other smaller groups, but Hausa is clearly dominant.

I should make sure to cite each source where I got the information to back up the answer. So, I'll mention Hausa as the largest group and note the presence of Fulani and others, citing the three sources that provide this information.

The largest ethnic group in Katsina State is the **Hausa people**. They constitute the majority of the population, with the Fulani being a significant minority. Additionally, there are smaller groups such as the Maguzawa and other non-indigenous communities[1][3][4].
