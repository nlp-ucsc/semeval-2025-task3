Okay, so I need to figure out the head town of the 12 de Octubre Department in Argentina. Let me start by looking at the search results provided. 

First, I see that result [1] is from Wikiwand about the Doce de Octubre Department. It clearly states that the head town is General Pinedo. It also provides some details like the area, population, and coordinates. That's a solid source.

Result [3] is from Wikipedia, and it also mentions that the head town is General Pinedo. It adds that the department has a population of about 20,000 and is located in Chaco Province. This corroborates the information from the first source.

Looking at result [5], it's another Wikipedia page, this time specifically about General Pinedo. It confirms that General Pinedo is the head town of the 12 de Octubre Department and provides the population figure from the 2001 census. 

The other results, like [2] and [4], don't seem relevant to the question about the head town, so I can ignore those. 

Putting it all together, all three relevant sources agree that General Pinedo is the head town. I should present this information clearly, citing each source where used to ensure accuracy.
