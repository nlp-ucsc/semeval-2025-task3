Okay, so I need to figure out what Petra van Staveren won a gold medal for. Let me start by looking through the search results provided.

First, I see that result  mentions she has one gold medal. Result [1] from Olympedia gives more details. It says she competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics and won gold in the 100 meters breaststroke. That's a primary source, so that's reliable.

Looking at result [2] from World Aquatics, it confirms she has one gold medal, specifically in the Olympic Games. It also mentions bronze and silver in other competitions, but the gold is from the Olympics.

Result [3] is about the 1984 Olympics women's 200m breaststroke. It shows she participated but didn't win gold there; she was 10th in the finals. So her gold must be from the 100m event.

Result [4] from Wikipedia explicitly states she won gold in the 100m breaststroke at the 1984 Olympics. This aligns with what I found in result [1]. 

Result [5] from Biographies.net also mentions the same thing, reinforcing that her gold was in the 100m breaststroke.

Putting it all together, Petra van Staveren's gold medal was in the 100 meters breaststroke at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. The other events she competed in didn't yield a gold, so that's her main achievement.
