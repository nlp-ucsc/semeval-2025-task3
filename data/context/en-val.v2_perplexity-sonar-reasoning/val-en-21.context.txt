Okay, so the user is asking if kremlins are similar to detinets. I need to figure this out using the provided search results. Let me start by looking through each result to understand what each term means.

From the first search result, I see that a detinets is an ancient Rus' city-fort, similar to a kremlin or citadel. It was used in places like Chernihiv, Novgorod, and Kyiv. The term has uncertain origins, possibly related to hiding children during sieges or from a Polish term meaning courtyard.

The second result is from Russia Beyond, which explains that detinets is the ancient term for what is now called a kremlin. It mentions that the Novgorod Detinets is an example, with a history dating back to the 10th century. It also notes that while kremlin is the general term, detinets refers specifically to the ancient ones, especially in the Novgorod region.

The third result from ITMO.news discusses kremlins as traditional Russian citadels built in the 14-17th centuries. It mentions that kremlins were often the heart of a city, containing key buildings. The article also points out that many kremlins started as wooden structures and evolved into stone ones, with only a dozen well-preserved today.

The fourth result is about a restaurant called Detinets, which doesn't seem relevant to the query, so I can ignore that.

The fifth result is the Wikipedia page on Novgorod Detinets, which refers to it as the Novgorod Kremlin. It details the history, layout, and buildings within the complex, reinforcing that detinets and kremlin are used interchangeably in this context.

Putting this together, it seems that detinets and kremlin are related terms. Detinets is the older term, specifically used in the Novgorod region, while kremlin became the more common term later. Both refer to fortified complexes at the heart of a city, serving similar purposes like defense and housing important buildings.

I should structure the answer to explain the relationship, noting that while they are similar, detinets is more of a historical term for the earlier versions, especially in specific regions. I'll also highlight the example of the Novgorod Detinets to illustrate this point.

Kremlins and detinets are closely related terms, with detinets being an older term used historically to describe what is now commonly referred to as a kremlin. Here's a detailed explanation of their relationship:

### Similarities Between Kremlins and Detinets:
1. **Fortified Structures**: Both kremlins and detinets were fortified complexes that served as the central, defensive core of a city or settlement. They were designed to protect the most important buildings and serve as the last line of defense during sieges[1][2].

2. **Historical Context**: The term "detinets" was used in ancient Rus' to describe these fortified centers, particularly in regions like Novgorod, Kyiv, and Chernihiv. Over time, the term "kremlin" became the more widely used designation for such structures, especially in the Muscovite period[1][2].

3. **Architectural Features**: Both terms refer to walled compounds with towers, thick walls, and strategic locations, often on high ground or near rivers. These structures housed key buildings such as cathedrals, administrative offices, and sometimes the residences of high-ranking officials[2][3].

4. **Symbol of Power**: Both kremlins and detinets symbolized the political and religious power of the city or state they protected. Capturing these structures often meant gaining control of the entire city[3].

### Differences:
1. **Terminology**: "Detinets" is an older term, primarily used in the early history of Kievan Rus' and in specific regions like Novgorod. "Kremlin" became the standard term in later centuries, especially after the rise of Moscow[1][2].

2. **Historical Usage**: The term "detinets" was more common in the 11th to 14th centuries, while "kremlin" gained prominence from the 14th century onward[1][2].

3. **Regional Variations**: The Novgorod Detinets, for example, retained the term "detinets" due to its historical significance and regional identity, even as other cities adopted the term "kremlin"[2][5].

### Example: The Novgorod Detinets:
The Novgorod Detinets, also known as the Novgorod Kremlin, is a prime example of how the terms overlap. It is a fortified complex that has served as the heart of Novgorod since the 10th century. Initially referred to as a detinets, it later came to be known as a kremlin. This structure includes the Cathedral of Holy Wisdom, the Episcopal Court, and other important buildings, showcasing the dual use of the terms in historical and modern contexts[2][5].

In summary, while "detinets" and "kremlin" are often used interchangeably, "detinets" is the older, more regionally specific term, whereas "kremlin" became the broader term for such fortified complexes in Russian history.
