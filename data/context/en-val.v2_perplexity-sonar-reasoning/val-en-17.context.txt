Okay, so I need to figure out the previous name of Gillette Stadium. Let me go through the search results provided to find the answer.

Looking at the first search result, it's from fun107.com and talks about Schaefer Stadium, which was the previous home of the Patriots before Gillette Stadium. But the question is about Gillette's previous name, not the stadium before it. So this might not be directly relevant, but it's good context.

The second result is the official Gillette Stadium website. It mentions that the stadium opened in 2002 but doesn't talk about its previous name. So this doesn't help with the answer.

The third result is a Wikipedia image, which probably isn't useful for text information. Moving on.

The fourth search result is from the Patriots' official website. It states that Gillette Stadium was previously known as CMGI Field before the naming rights were acquired by Gillette. This seems like the key information needed.

The fifth result is the Wikipedia page for Gillette Stadium, which also mentions that it was originally called CMGI Field before being renamed. This confirms the information from the fourth source.

So, putting it together, the previous name of Gillette Stadium was CMGI Field. The name was changed after Gillette purchased the naming rights following the dot-com bust. This information is consistent across multiple sources, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.

The previous name of Gillette Stadium was **CMGI Field**. The stadium was renamed Gillette Stadium after The Gillette Company acquired the naming rights, replacing the original name following the dot-com bust[4][5].
