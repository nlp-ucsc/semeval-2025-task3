Okay, so I need to figure out who the father of Carl Löwenhielm was. Let me start by looking at the search results provided. 

First, I see that result [1] is from DBpedia and mentions that Carl Löwenhielm was an illegitimate son of King Charles XIII of Sweden and Augusta von Fersen. That seems pretty straightforward. 

Result [2] from Wikiwand also states that Carl Axel Löwenhielm was the illegitimate son of King Charles XIII and Augusta von Fersen. It adds that his mother was married to Fredrik Adolf Löwenhielm, which explains why he has that last name even though his biological father was the king. 

Result [3] is about the Löwenhielm family history. It talks about the family's origins and mentions several members, including Carl Löwenhielm, but doesn't specifically address his parentage beyond what's already in the other results. 

Result [4] is about Gustaf Löwenhielm, who is Carl's half-brother. It mentions their shared mother, Augusta Fersen, and her husband, Fredrik Adolf Löwenhielm. This reinforces that Carl's biological father was the king, while his mother was married to another man. 

Result [5] again confirms that Carl was the illegitimate son of King Charles XIII and Augusta von Fersen, and that Gustaf was his half-brother. 

Putting this all together, it's clear that Carl's father was King Charles XIII, even though he was born out of wedlock. His mother was married to another noble, which is why his last name is Löwenhielm. All the sources consistently point to this information, so I can confidently state that King Charles XIII was Carl Löwenhielm's father.

Carl Löwenhielm's father was King Charles XIII of Sweden. Although he was born out of wedlock, his mother, Augusta von Fersen, was married to Fredrik Adolf Löwenhielm, which is why Carl bore the Löwenhielm name. This information is consistent across multiple sources, including DBpedia, Wikiwand, and Wikipedia entries on both Carl and his half-brother Gustaf Löwenhielm[1][2][5].
