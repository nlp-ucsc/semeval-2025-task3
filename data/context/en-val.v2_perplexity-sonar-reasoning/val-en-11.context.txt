Okay, so the user is asking when the merger between Takara and Tomy happened. I need to find the exact date and some details around it. Let me check the search results provided.

Looking at result [1], it's from The Japan Times in 2005. It says the merger was agreed upon on May 14, 2005, and was set to take place on March 1, 2006. That's a primary source, so that's reliable.

Result [2] is a PDF from Takara Tomy's financial reports. It mentions the merger in 2006, aligning with what I found in result [1]. It also talks about their expansion goals, which adds context but the key date is 2006.

Result [3] is from Tformers, dated May 13, 2005. It confirms the merger effective date as March 1, 2006, and notes that Tomy would be the surviving company. This corroborates the other sources.

Result [4] is another Tformers article, which goes into more detail about the merger agreement, signed on August 5, 2005, with the merger set for March 1, 2006. It also discusses the merger ratio and other financial aspects, which supports the date.

Result [5] is the Wikipedia page for Takara, which states the merger became effective on March 1, 2006. This is a secondary source but aligns with the others.

All sources consistently point to March 1, 2006, as the merger date. They also mention that Tomy was the surviving company and provide some context about the reasons behind the merger, like strengthening their market position and expanding internationally.

I should structure the answer to clearly state the date, mention the surviving company, and perhaps a bit about the background without going into too much detail since the user just asked for the date. I'll make sure to cite each source where the date is mentioned to back up the information.
