Okay, I need to figure out what Valrico, Florida was known as before the Civil War. Let me look through the search results provided.

First, I see that result [1] mentions that the area surrounding Valrico Lake was first known as "Long Pond." That seems like a solid piece of information. Result [3] also states that before the Civil War, the area was called Long Pond and had cotton plantations. So that's consistent.

Result [4] from the Tampa Bay Times refers to it as Long Pond or Lake Hunter, which adds another name but still points to the same area. Result [5], the Wikipedia page, again confirms that it was known as Long Pond before being renamed Valrico.

I should make sure to mention the cotton plantations as that's a key point about what the area was known for. Also, the name Long Pond is mentioned in multiple sources, so it's reliable. I don't see any conflicting information, so I can confidently state that Valrico was known as Long Pond before the Civil War, with cotton plantations being a significant part of its history.
