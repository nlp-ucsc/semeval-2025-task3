Okay, so the user is asking in which US state Posey County is located. Let me check the search results provided.

Looking at the first search result from Wikipedia, it clearly states that Posey County is in Indiana. The second result from the county government site also mentions it's in Indiana. The third result from Indiana Connection again confirms Indiana. The fourth result from Purdue Extension and the fifth from Data USA both also say Indiana. So all sources agree that Posey County is in Indiana.

I should make sure to present this information clearly, perhaps mentioning the specific location within the state, like the southwest corner, as some results highlight that. Also, noting the neighboring counties and rivers might add useful context. I'll structure the answer to first state the state, then provide some geographical details to give a complete picture.
