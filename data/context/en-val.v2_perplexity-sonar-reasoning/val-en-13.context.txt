Okay, so I need to figure out in which country Cilleruelo de San Mamés is located. Let me start by looking at the search results provided. 

The first search result is from Wikipedia in Asturian. It mentions that Cilleruelo de San Mamés is a conceyu d'España, which translates to a municipality of Spain. It also notes that it's in the province of Segovia, within the autonomous community of Castile and León. So that's a clear indication that it's in Spain.

Looking at the second search result from Maptons.com, it provides geographical coordinates and other details. It clearly states that Cilleruelo de San Mamés is in Segovia, Castilla y León, Spain. This reinforces the information from the first source.

The third result is from Wikidata, which labels Cilleruelo de San Mamés as a municipality of Spain. Wikidata is a reliable source, so this adds more confidence.

The fourth result from Tageo.com also mentions that it's part of the Kingdom of Spain, located in Europe. It provides more geographical details but again confirms the country as Spain.

The fifth result is from Alamy, which is a stock photo site. It describes Cilleruelo de San Mamés as being in Segovia, Spain, within Castille and León. This is consistent with the other sources.

Putting all this together, every source consistently points to Spain as the country where Cilleruelo de San Mamés is located. There's no conflicting information, so I can be confident in this answer.
