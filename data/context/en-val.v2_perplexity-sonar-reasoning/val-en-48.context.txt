Okay, so the user is asking for the name Gregory III Laham was given at birth. Let me go through the search results to find this information.

Looking at the first search result, it's from the Melkite Greek Catholic Church Information Center. It says he was born as Lutfi Laham on December 15, 1933, in Daraya, Syria. That seems straightforward.

The second result is from the Vatican press office. It mentions his birth name as Loufti Laham, which is another spelling of Lutfi. So both sources agree, just different spellings.

The third result is from Wikidata, which also states his birth name as Gregory III Laham, but that's his religious name, not his birth name. So I can ignore that part.

The fourth source is from Herald Malaysia, which again refers to him as Gregory III Laham, but in the context of his resignation. It doesn't provide his birth name, so not helpful for this specific question.

The fifth result is from Catholic-Hierarchy.org. It lists his birth name as Lutfi Laham, confirming the earlier information.

So putting it all together, his birth name was Lutfi Laham, and as a religious figure, he took the name Gregory III. The different spellings like Loufti are just variations of the same name.
