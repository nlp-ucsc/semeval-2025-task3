Okay, I need to figure out the population of Galicia, a Spanish region. Let me look through the search results provided.

First, result [1] from Statista says that as of July 2024, Galicia has 2.7 million inhabitants. It also breaks down the population by age groups, but the main figure is 2.7 million.

Result [2] from Fundación Galicia Europa mentions that in 2021, the population was 2,695,645. That's a bit older data, so probably less accurate now.

Result [4] is a Wikipedia table that lists Galicia's population as 2,706,643 in 2024. This is very close to the Statista figure but slightly more precise.

Result [5] is another Wikipedia page, but it's from 2018, so it's outdated. The 2018 population was 2,701,743, which is lower than the current numbers.

So, the most recent and accurate data comes from results [1] and [4]. Statista gives 2.7 million, and Wikipedia's 2024 data is 2,706,643. These are very close, so I can confidently say the population is approximately 2.7 million as of 2024.

The population of the Spanish autonomous community of Galicia as of 2024 is approximately **2.7 million inhabitants**. This makes Galicia one of the most populated regions in Spain[1][4].
