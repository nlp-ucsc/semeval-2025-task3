Okay, so I need to figure out when the Swedish Navy was founded. Let me start by looking at the search results provided. 

The first result is from Wikipedia, which states that the Swedish Navy was founded under King Gustav Vasa in 1522. It also mentions that this makes it one of the oldest continuously serving navies, celebrating its 500th anniversary in 2022. The second result from Simple Wikipedia confirms this, saying it was started under King Gustav I in 1522. 

Looking at the third result, it's a podcast transcript that discusses the founding by Gustav Eriksson, also known as Gustav Vasa, in 1522. It mentions that he purchased ships from Lübeck to support his revolt against Denmark, which aligns with the other sources. 

The fourth result is a PDF about the Swedish fiscal-military state and its navy, which also points to the founding in the 1520s by the Vasa dynasty. It details how Gustav I established a centralized administration for the navy, which supports the 1522 date.

The fifth result is about the Swedish Navy in WW1, which doesn't directly address the founding date but confirms the navy's long-standing existence.

Putting it all together, all sources consistently point to 1522 as the founding year under Gustav Vasa. The detailed information from the podcast and the PDF adds context about the circumstances, like purchasing ships from Lübeck and the centralization efforts. 

I should make sure to present this information clearly, citing each source where applicable. It's important to note the significance of the founding, such as its status as one of the oldest navies and the 500th anniversary. Also, mentioning the transition from earlier systems to a more formal navy under Gustav Vasa adds depth to the answer.

The Swedish Navy was founded in 1522 under King Gustav Vasa, making it one of the oldest continuously serving navies in the world. This foundational year is celebrated as the establishment of the modern Swedish Navy, marking its 500th anniversary in 2022[1][2][3][4]. The creation of the navy was a pivotal moment in Sweden's history, driven by the need for maritime defense and the centralization of military power under the Vasa dynasty[4].
