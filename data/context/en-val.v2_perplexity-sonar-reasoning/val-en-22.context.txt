Okay, I need to figure out where Hamilton Academical F.C. plays their home matches. Let me go through the search results provided.

Looking at result , it mentions games for Hamilton Academical F.C. but doesn't specify the stadium. So, not helpful for the location.

Result [1] is about SuperSeal Stadium, also known as New Douglas Park. It says it's the home of Hamilton Academical FC since 2001. The address is ML3 0FT, and it's located in Hamilton, near the town center. There's info about how to get there by train, including Hamilton West station being a 5-minute walk. This seems like the main source.

Result [2] is an Instagram page for the stadium, confirming the location as ML3 0FT but doesn't add much else.

Result [3] from The Celtic Wiki also mentions New Douglas Park as Hamilton's home since 2001. It provides directions by car, train, and mentions parking. It also notes the capacity as approximately 6,000. This corroborates the info from result [1].

Result [4] is the Wikipedia page for New Douglas Park. It confirms the stadium is home to Hamilton Academical and another team, Clyde. It details the stadium's history, including name changes and renovations. The capacity and location are consistent with previous results.

Result [5] discusses the history of Douglas Park, the old stadium, but since the team moved to New Douglas Park in 2001, it's not directly relevant but provides context.

Putting it all together, all relevant results point to New Douglas Park (also known by sponsorship names) as the home stadium. The capacity is around 5,510 to 6,000, and it's located in Hamilton with good transport links, especially via Hamilton West train station.
