Okay, so I need to figure out when Chance the Rapper debuted. I'm not super familiar with his career, but I know he's a rapper from Chicago. Let me start by looking at the search results provided.

The first result is from Wikipedia, which mentions that Chance released his debut mixtape, 10 Day, in 2012. It also talks about his second mixtape, Acid Rap, in 2013, which brought him mainstream recognition. So that's a good starting point.

The second result is from Britannica. It says he burst onto the scene in the early 2010s and is known for poetic lyrics. It also mentions his mixtapes, 10 Day and Acid Rap, with the latter released in 2013. This aligns with the first source.

The third result is his discography on Wikipedia. It lists 10 Day as released on April 3, 2012, and Acid Rap on April 30, 2013. It also mentions his studio album, The Big Day, in 2019. So the debut was definitely 10 Day in 2012.

The fourth result is from Biography.com. It talks about his debut mixtape, 10 Day, released after a school suspension. It also mentions his first album, The Big Day, in 2019. So again, 10 Day in 2012 is the debut.

The fifth result is from TeachRock. It states that in 2012, he released 10 Day following a suspension. Then in 2013, Acid Rap came out, which was critically acclaimed. This confirms the 2012 debut.

Putting it all together, Chance the Rapper's debut was with the mixtape 10 Day in 2012. His second mixtape, Acid Rap, followed in 2013 and brought him more recognition. He later released his first studio album in 2019. So the answer should clearly state that his debut was in 2012 with 10 Day, and then mention Acid Rap as a follow-up that increased his popularity.
