Okay, so I need to figure out the four styles of Zhejiang cuisine. Let me start by looking at the search results provided. 

First, from result [1], it mentions that Zhejiang cuisine is divided into four local cuisines: Hangzhou, Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Wenzhou (also known as Ou cuisine). It gives a brief description of each, highlighting their specialties like Hangzhou's use of bamboo shoots and Ningbo's focus on seafood.

Result [2] talks about three major styles: Hangzhou, Ningbo, and Shaoxing. It describes Hangzhou as the most refined, with a preference for stir-fried dishes and seafood. Ningbo is noted for salty seafood, and Shaoxing focuses on poultry and freshwater fish. This result doesn't mention Wenzhou, so maybe it's considering only the main three.

Result [3] from Wikipedia also lists four styles, including Wenzhou. It provides more detailed descriptions and notable dishes for each style. For example, Hangzhou style includes dishes like Dongpo Pork and West Lake Fish, while Ningbo is known for its salty dishes and confectioneries. Shaoxing uses Shaoxing wine in their cooking, and Wenzhou contributes dishes like Wenzhou pig intestine rice noodle soup.

Result [4] is an image link, so it doesn't provide additional text information. Result [5] mentions Zhejiang cuisine as part of the Four Great Cuisines, highlighting Hangzhou and Ningbo styles but not the others.

Putting this together, it seems that while some sources group Zhejiang cuisine into three styles (Hangzhou, Ningbo, Shaoxing), others include a fourth, Wenzhou or Ou cuisine. The most comprehensive answer would include all four, as detailed in the Wikipedia result. Therefore, the four styles are Hangzhou, Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Wenzhou.

The four styles of Zhejiang cuisine are:

1. **Hangzhou Cuisine** - Known for its refined techniques and emphasis on freshness, often incorporating bamboo shoots. Notable dishes include Dongpo Pork and West Lake Fish in Vinegar.

2. **Ningbo Cuisine** - Specializes in seafood with a focus on salty flavors. It's celebrated for its confectioneries and dishes like Ningbo Braised Eel.

3. **Shaoxing Cuisine** - Focuses on poultry and freshwater fish, often using Shaoxing rice wine in cooking. Dishes include Sister Song's Fish Soup.

4. **Wenzhou (Ou) Cuisine** - Characterized by its seafood and dishes like Wenzhou pig intestine rice noodle soup, influenced by its proximity to Fujian Province.

These styles together showcase Zhejiang's culinary diversity, emphasizing fresh ingredients and varied cooking techniques.
