Okay, so the user is asking which Roman emperors were born in Lugdunum. I remember that Lugdunum is modern-day Lyon in France. I need to find out which emperors were born there.

Looking at the search results, the first result [1] is about Claudius. It says he was born in Lugdunum, Gaul, which is Lyon. So Claudius is one.

The second result [2] is a list of Roman emperors by birthplace. Scanning through, I see Claudius listed as being born in Lugdunum, Gaul, which confirms the first result. It also mentions Caracalla, but wait, no, Caracalla is in result [3]. Let me check that.

Result [3] is about Caracalla, stating he was born in Lugdunum as well. So that's two emperors: Claudius and Caracalla.

Result [4] is from Pleiades and also mentions that both Claudius and Caracalla were born in Lugdunum. This reinforces the information from the other sources.

Result [5] is the Wikipedia page on Claudius, again confirming his birthplace as Lugdunum.

So putting it all together, both Claudius and Caracalla were born in Lugdunum. I should present this clearly, maybe in a list with their names and reign periods for clarity.

Two Roman emperors were born in Lugdunum (modern-day Lyon, France):

1. **Claudius** (reigned 41–54 CE) - He was the first Roman emperor born outside Italy and extended Roman rule in North Africa and Britain [1][4][5].
2. **Caracalla** (reigned 198–217 CE) - Known for his edict granting Roman citizenship to all free inhabitants of the empire, he was also born in Lugdunum [3][4].
