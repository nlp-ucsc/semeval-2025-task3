Okay, so the user is asking about the location of the 26th Biathlon World Championships. Let me check the search results provided.

Looking at result [2], it's a Wikipedia page about the 1991 Biathlon World Championships. It clearly states that they were held in Lahti, Finland. That seems straightforward.

I don't see any conflicting information in the other results. The other results are about different seasons or future events, so they don't impact this specific query. 

I should make sure to present the answer clearly, citing the relevant source. Since the user wants a detailed manner, I'll mention the year and location, and perhaps note that it was the second time Lahti hosted the event, as mentioned in the search result.

So, the answer should be concise but informative, ensuring that the citation is correctly placed at the end of the sentence.
