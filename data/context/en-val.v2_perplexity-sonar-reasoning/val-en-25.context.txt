Okay, so I need to figure out when the municipalities of Gampel and Bratsch were merged. Let me start by looking through the search results provided.

First, I see that result [2] is from Wikipedia and it's about Gampel-Bratsch. It says that the municipality was formed on January 1, 2009. That seems straightforward, but I should check if there's more information elsewhere.

Looking at result [4], which is also a Wikipedia page but about Gampel, it mentions that Gampel merged with Bratsch on January 1, 2009, to form Gampel-Bratsch. So that's consistent with what I found in result [2].

I don't see any conflicting information in the other search results. Results [1], [3], and [5] talk about other aspects of Gampel-Bratsch, like their ICT infrastructure, street name changes, and historical industrial activities, but they don't mention the merger date. So the relevant information is in results [2] and [4], both pointing to the same year.

I should make sure there's no other date mentioned, but it seems both sources agree on 2009. Therefore, the merger happened in 2009.
