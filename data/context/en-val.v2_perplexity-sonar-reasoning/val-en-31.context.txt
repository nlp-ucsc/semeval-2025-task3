Okay, so the user is asking about the size of a western oriole. I need to provide a detailed answer. Let me check the search results provided.

Looking at result [1], it's from Wikipedia about the western oriole. It says the bird measures 21 centimeters in length and weighs between 42 to 57 grams. That's a good starting point. I should convert the centimeters to inches for better understanding, so 21 cm is about 8.3 inches.

Next, I should compare this with other oriole species to give context. Results [2] and [3] are about Bullock's and Hooded Orioles, respectively. Bullock's is 6.7-7.5 inches long, and Hooded is 7.1-7.9 inches. So the western oriole is a bit larger than these.

I also need to mention the weight in ounces since the user might be more familiar with that. 42-57 grams convert to roughly 1.5 to 2.0 ounces. 

Putting it all together, I'll structure the answer by first stating the size and weight, then comparing it with other similar species to highlight its relative size. This should give the user a clear and detailed understanding of how big a western oriole is.

The western oriole measures **21 centimeters (8.3 inches)** in length and weighs between **42 to 57 grams (1.5 to 2.0 ounces)**[1]. This makes it a medium-sized bird, slightly larger than some other oriole species, such as the Bullock's Oriole, which is approximately 6.7-7.5 inches (17-19 cm) in length[2], and the Hooded Oriole, which is about 7.1-7.9 inches (18-20 cm) in length[3]. The western oriole's size and weight place it firmly in the range of typical oriole dimensions, with a sleek and streamlined body adapted for its arboreal habitat.
