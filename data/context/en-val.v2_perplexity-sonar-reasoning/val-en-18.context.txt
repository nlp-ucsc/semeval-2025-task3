Okay, so the user is asking if a graphics address remapping table (GART) is a type of input-output memory management unit (IOMMU). I need to figure this out using the provided search results.

First, I'll look through each search result to find relevant information. 

Search result [1] is about GART. It says GART is an IOMMU used by AGP and PCIe graphics cards. It allows the GPU to access system memory for textures and other data. So that directly links GART to IOMMU.

Search result [2] explains IOMMU in general. It mentions that IOMMU provides memory remapping and address translation for I/O devices. This aligns with what GART does, as per result [1].

Result [3] from Wikipedia also states that an example of an IOMMU is GART used by AGP and PCIe graphics cards. This confirms the connection again.

Result [4] is a patent about IOMMU, discussing its structure and function, which includes address translation. While it doesn't mention GART specifically, it supports the understanding of IOMMU's role.

Result [5] talks about descriptor tables in DirectX, which isn't directly relevant to the question but shows how GPUs manage memory, which ties back to GART's function.

Putting it all together, multiple sources confirm that GART is indeed a type of IOMMU. It's used to manage memory access for graphics cards, fitting the definition of an IOMMU. So the answer should clearly state that GART is a specific example of an IOMMU, explaining its role and how it fits within the broader IOMMU concept.

Yes, a **Graphics Address Remapping Table (GART)** is a type of **Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU)**. 

### Explanation:
1. **Graphics Address Remapping Table (GART)**:
   - The GART is specifically designed for use with graphics cards using the Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) and PCI Express (PCIe) interfaces[1][3].
   - It enables the graphics card to access system memory directly, allowing for efficient data exchange between the graphics processing unit (GPU) and the main system memory. This is particularly useful for loading textures, polygon meshes, and other graphical data[1].
   - The GART can also expand the available video memory for systems with integrated or shared graphics processors, though this comes at the cost of reserving a portion of system memory exclusively for graphics use[1].

2. **Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU)**:
   - An IOMMU is a hardware component that provides memory management and address translation services for I/O devices[2][3].
   - It translates device-visible virtual addresses to physical addresses in system memory, enabling secure and efficient direct memory access (DMA) for peripherals like graphics cards, network adapters, and disk controllers[2][3].
   - The IOMMU also provides memory protection, preventing unauthorized access to system memory by I/O devices[3].

3. **Relationship Between GART and IOMMU**:
   - The GART is a specific implementation of an IOMMU, tailored for graphics cards. It performs the same core functions of address translation and memory management but is optimized for the unique demands of graphics processing[1][3].
   - Both GART and IOMMU enable DMA operations, allowing devices to access system memory directly without involving the CPU, which is critical for high-performance applications like 3D rendering[1][2].

In summary, the GART is a specialized form of IOMMU designed to manage memory access for graphics cards, while the term IOMMU refers to a broader class of memory management units used by various I/O devices.
