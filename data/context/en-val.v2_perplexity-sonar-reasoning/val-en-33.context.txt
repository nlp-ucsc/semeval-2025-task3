Okay, so the user is asking if Chris Claremont is the sole writer of Days of Future Past. Let me break this down. First, I know that Days of Future Past is a famous X-Men storyline, and I remember that Chris Claremont was heavily involved with the X-Men comics. From the search results, I see that Claremont co-wrote the original comic storyline with John Byrne. That means he wasn't the sole writer there; he had a collaborator.

Now, looking at the movie adaptation, the 2014 film has a screenplay by Simon Kinberg, and it's directed by Bryan Singer. The story was developed by Kinberg, Jane Goldman, and Matthew Vaughn. So, the movie's writing credits don't include Claremont as a writer, but the story is based on his work. Therefore, Claremont isn't the sole writer of the movie; he's more of the original creator whose work inspired the film.

I should make sure to clarify both the comic and the movie in my answer, explaining Claremont's role in each. I'll need to cite the relevant search results to back up each point. Also, I should mention that while Claremont is a key figure in the comics, the movie had a different set of writers. This way, the user gets a clear understanding of his contribution without any confusion.

Chris Claremont is not the sole writer of *Days of Future Past*. The original comic book storyline, "Days of Future Past," was co-written by Chris Claremont and artist John Byrne and published in *The Uncanny X-Men* #141-142 in 1981[1][2]. Claremont and Byrne collaborated on the story, which has since become a landmark in comic book history[1].

For the 2014 film adaptation, *X-Men: Days of Future Past*, the screenplay was written by Simon Kinberg, with a story credited to Kinberg, Jane Goldman, and Matthew Vaughn[2][5]. While Claremont's original comic storyline inspired the film, he was not directly involved in writing the screenplay[2][4]. The film's narrative was adapted to fit the continuity of the X-Men film franchise, combining elements from the original comics with new material[2].

In summary, while Chris Claremont co-wrote the original "Days of Future Past" comic book story, he was not the sole writer of the 2014 film adaptation, which had a separate screenwriting team[1][2][4][5].
