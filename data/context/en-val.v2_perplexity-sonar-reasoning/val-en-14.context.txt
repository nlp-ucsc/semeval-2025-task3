Okay, so the user is asking about when the Bleeding Kansas civil confrontations took place. I need to provide a detailed answer. Let me look through the search results to find the relevant information.

First, I see that result [1] from Wikipedia states that Bleeding Kansas occurred between 1854 and 1859. It mentions specific events like the Wakarusa War in 1855 and the Pottawatomie Creek massacre in 1856. Also, it notes that the conflict ended when Kansas was admitted as a free state in 1861, but the main violence was between 1854 and 1859.

Result [2] discusses the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which led to the tensions. It explains how the act repealed the Missouri Compromise, causing pro-slavery and anti-slavery groups to rush into Kansas, leading to the violent confrontations starting around 1854.

Result [3] from the National Park Service also mentions that the violence continued until 1861 when Kansas became a free state. It highlights events in 1858, showing that the conflict lasted several years.

Result [4] from the American Battlefield Trust specifies the period as roughly between 1855 and 1859, with the Sack of Lawrence in 1856 being a key event that escalated the violence.

Result [5] from the National Archives again points to the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 as the starting point and mentions the violent confrontations that followed, earning the name "Bleeding Kansas."

Putting this all together, the confrontations started in 1854 after the Kansas-Nebraska Act and continued through 1859, with the most intense violence happening around 1856. The conflict effectively ended in 1861 when Kansas was admitted as a free state. I should structure the answer to clearly show the timeline, highlighting the key years and events to provide a detailed response.

The Bleeding Kansas civil confrontations took place between **1854 and 1859**, with the most intense violence occurring around **1856**. This period of conflict emerged as a result of the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which allowed the territories of Kansas and Nebraska to decide on the issue of slavery through popular sovereignty. Pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions clashed violently, leading to events such as the Wakarusa War in 1855, the Sack of Lawrence in 1856, and the Pottawatomie Creek massacre, also in 1856. The conflict continued until 1859, when the violence began to subside, and Kansas was eventually admitted to the Union as a free state in 1861[1][2][4][5].
