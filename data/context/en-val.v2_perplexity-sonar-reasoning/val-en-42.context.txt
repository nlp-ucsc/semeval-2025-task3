Okay, so the user is asking who Dave Franco played in Scrubs. I need to find the relevant information from the search results provided. Let me go through each result one by one.

First, looking at result [1], it's from Digital Spy and mentions that Dave Franco joined Scrubs as a series regular. It says he played Cole, a charming, conservative, confidently stupid, and entitled medical student. That's a good start.

Result [2] is the Wikipedia page for Scrubs. It confirms that Dave Franco portrayed Cole Aaronson in season 9. It adds more details about his character, like his family donating money to build the hospital, which makes him feel untouchable. It also mentions that after getting skin cancer and going into remission, Cole decides to specialize in surgery and is in a relationship with Lucy Bennett.

Result [3] is Dave Franco's Wikipedia page. It lists his role as Cole Aaronson in Scrubs for 13 episodes from 2009 to 2010. This gives me the duration of his involvement and the number of episodes, which adds more depth.

Result [4] is from NBC Insider and also mentions Cole Aaronson, played by Dave Franco, appearing in Scrubs. It provides a bit more context about his character's personality and background.

Putting it all together, I can structure the answer by first stating the character's name and the season, then adding details about his personality, background, and storyline. I should also mention the number of episodes and the impact of his character in the show's ninth season.

I need to make sure to cite each piece of information correctly, using the indices from the search results. Also, I should present the information clearly and concisely, avoiding any markdown as per the user's request for the thinking process.
