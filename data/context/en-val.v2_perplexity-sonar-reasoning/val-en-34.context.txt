Okay, so I need to figure out when Toruń was part of the Hanseatic League. Let me start by looking through the search results provided.

The first search result [1] mentions that Toruń became a member of the Hansa in 1280, which is less than five decades after its establishment. It also notes that Toruń was quite active in the League, trading goods like Flemish cloth, Ruthenian wax, and Masovian wood. They even participated in many meetings, which shows their active role.

Looking at the second result [2], it says Toruń joined the Hanseatic League during the 14th century. This seems a bit conflicting because the first result says 1280, which is in the 13th century. Maybe the 14th century was when they became more prominent or when they had their own merchant fleet.

The third result [3] also states that Toruń became a leading member of the Hanseatic League under the Teutonic Order. It doesn't give a specific date but reinforces that they were significant in the League.

The fourth result [4] provides more detailed information. It mentions that Toruń joined in 1280 and remained a member until 1411 when they left after the First Peace of Thorn. This gives a clear timeframe from 1280 to 1411.

The fifth result [5] from UNESCO describes Toruń as a leading member but doesn't specify the exact years. It focuses more on the town's development and architecture.

Putting this together, the key dates are 1280 when they joined and 1411 when they left. The 14th century mention in result [2] might refer to their active trading period rather than the joining date. So, the accurate timeframe is from 1280 to 1411.
