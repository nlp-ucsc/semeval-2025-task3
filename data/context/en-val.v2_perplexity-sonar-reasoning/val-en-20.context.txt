Okay, so I need to figure out in which oblast Nizhny Tagil is located. Let me start by looking at the search results provided.

The first search result is from Simple English Wikipedia. It clearly states that Nizhny Tagil is a city in Sverdlovsk Oblast, Russia. That seems straightforward. But I should check the other results to confirm.

The second result is about the oblasts of Russia in general. It mentions that there are 46 oblasts, each being a federal subject. Sverdlovsk Oblast is one of them, so that's consistent with the first result.

The third search result is from the Scottish Wikipedia. It also says Nizhny Tagil is in Sverdlovsk Oblast. So that's another confirmation.

The fourth result is about Chattanooga's sister cities, which includes Nizhny Tagil, and it mentions that the city is in the Sverdlovsk region. That's another way of referring to the same oblast.

The fifth result discusses maps of Russian administrative divisions, including oblasts, but it doesn't specifically mention Nizhny Tagil. However, since all other sources point to Sverdlovsk, I can be confident.

Putting it all together, all relevant sources agree that Nizhny Tagil is located in Sverdlovsk Oblast. There's no conflicting information, so I can conclude that's the correct answer.

Nizhny Tagil is located in **Sverdlovsk Oblast**, Russia[1][3][4]. This oblast is one of the 46 federal subjects of Russia and serves as the administrative division for the region where the city is situated[2].
