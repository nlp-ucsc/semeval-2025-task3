Okay, so I need to figure out who the first physician was to treat patients for cerebral palsy. I remember that the user provided several search results, so I should go through each of them to find the relevant information.

Looking at search result [1], it mentions Dr. John Little as the first to study and define cerebral palsy in 1853. He gave lectures in the 1830s about birth injuries and their impact. He also published a book in 1843 about deformities and their treatment. In 1861, he presented a paper defining cerebral palsy, linking it to oxygen deprivation during birth. His work was so significant that spastic cerebral palsy was initially called "Little's Disease."

Search result [2] also talks about William John Little, an orthopedic surgeon who researched congenital malformations. He presented research on a condition now known as cerebral palsy in 1861, linking it to oxygen deprivation during birth. He founded the Royal Orthopedic Hospital and performed surgeries to correct deformities.

Result [3] again highlights Dr. William John Little as the first to study CP in 1853. He had personal experiences with illness and disability, which motivated his work. He presented his findings to the Obstetrical Society of London, explaining that the nervous system injury leads to spasticity. His work was later termed "Little's Disease."

Result [4] discusses the systematic treatment of CP, mentioning Adolf Lorenz and others, but the key point is that William John Little was the first to describe the orthopedic consequences of perinatal pathology. He also founded a hospital and developed treatments.

Result [5] again points to Dr. William John Little as the first to define CP as a brain injury from oxygen deprivation at birth. He started his work in the 1830s, published his research, and his contributions were so impactful that his name became associated with the condition.

Putting it all together, it's clear that Dr. William John Little was the pioneer. He not only defined the condition but also developed treatments, including surgeries, and established medical institutions to help patients. His work laid the foundation for understanding and treating cerebral palsy, making him the first physician to treat patients for this condition.

Dr. William John Little is recognized as the first physician to study and treat cerebral palsy. He began his work in the 1830s, focusing on the effects of birth injuries and oxygen deprivation, which he linked to the condition. In 1861, he presented a paper to the Obstetrical Society of London, defining cerebral palsy and associating it with nervous system damage. His contributions led to the condition initially being known as "Little's Disease." Dr. Little also established the Royal Orthopedic Hospital and developed surgical treatments, laying the groundwork for modern approaches to cerebral palsy care.

**Answer:**
Dr. William John Little is acknowledged as the first physician to treat cerebral palsy. His pioneering work in the 19th century included linking the condition to oxygen deprivation during birth and developing early treatment methods, earning him the association of the condition as "Little's Disease."
