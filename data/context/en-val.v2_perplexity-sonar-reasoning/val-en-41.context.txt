Okay, so the user is asking about the real name of "Edu Manga." Hmm, I don't recall any information about someone named Edu Manga from the search results provided. Let me check the search results again.

Looking at the first search result, it's about Eiichiro Oda, the creator of One Piece. The second result is from a forum discussing the protagonist's name in Persona 3 FES. Neither of these mention anything about Edu Manga. 

Wait, maybe "Edu Manga" is a lesser-known figure or perhaps a misspelling. Could it be a different name or a character from another series? Since the search results don't provide any details, I can't find any relevant information. 

I should inform the user that there's no available data on Edu Manga based on the provided sources. Maybe suggest checking other resources or providing more context if possible.

The search results do not contain any information about "Edu Manga." If you have more context or details about this person, I might be able to help further.
