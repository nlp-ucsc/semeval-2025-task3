Okay, so the user is asking about who the head of the FBI’s White Collar Crimes Unit is in the TV series White Collar. I remember that the show features an FBI team, so I need to figure out the character's name and the actor who plays him.

Looking at the search results, the first result is the Wikipedia page for White Collar. It mentions that Tim DeKay plays FBI Special Agent Peter Burke, who is the head of the White Collar Crimes Unit in New York. That seems like the answer.

The second search result is a PSA by Tim DeKay as Peter Burke, which reinforces that he's part of the FBI in the show. The third result is another Wikipedia page about the characters, which again lists Peter Burke as the head of the unit.

So, putting it all together, the head is Peter Burke, played by Tim DeKay. I should mention his role, maybe some traits like being by-the-book, and his relationship with Neal Caffrey. Also, including some of his background from the show, like his education and personal life, would make the answer detailed.

I need to structure this clearly, maybe in a paragraph form without using any markdown. Keep it concise but informative, citing the sources where the info comes from. Make sure to highlight his leadership and his dynamic with Neal as that's a key part of the show.
