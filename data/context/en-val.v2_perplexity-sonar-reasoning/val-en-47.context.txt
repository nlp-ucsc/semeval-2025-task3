Okay, so I need to figure out when Bischofsheim was a constituent community of Mainz. Let me go through the search results provided to find the relevant information.

Looking at search result [1], it mentions that Bischofsheim was incorporated into Mainz on January 1, 1930, due to financial difficulties. It also states that after World War II, Bischofsheim became part of Hesse again. So that gives me the start and end dates.

Search result [5] from Wikipedia also talks about the station being renamed Mainz-Bischofsheim between 1930 and 1945, which aligns with the incorporation period. It also notes that after 1945, Bischofsheim became an independent municipality again.

I don't see any conflicting information in the other search results. They focus more on earlier history, Jewish history, and the railway, which aren't directly relevant to the specific question about incorporation into Mainz.

So, putting it together, Bischofsheim was part of Mainz from 1930 to 1945.
