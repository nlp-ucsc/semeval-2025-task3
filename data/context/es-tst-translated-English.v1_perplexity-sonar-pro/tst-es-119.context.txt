Dissidia Final Fantasy was first released on the PlayStation Portable (PSP) in 2008[1][2]. 

The original Dissidia Final Fantasy game debuted on Sony's handheld PSP console in December 2008 in Japan, followed by releases in other regions in 2009[1]. This was the first entry in the Dissidia subseries of Final Fantasy fighting games, which brought together characters from across the mainline Final Fantasy titles.

Some key details about the original PSP release:

- It was developed by Square Enix as a fighting game spin-off celebrating the Final Fantasy franchise's 20th anniversary[2].
- The game featured one-on-one battles between heroes and villains from the first ten mainline Final Fantasy games.
- It received a sequel, Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, also on PSP in 2011[1].
- The PSP games were quite popular, leading to demand for a console version[3].

It wasn't until much later that Dissidia made the jump to home consoles. An arcade version was released in 2015, which was then ported to PlayStation 4 in 2018 as Dissidia Final Fantasy NT[1]. However, the original game and its direct sequel remained exclusive to the PSP platform.

So in summary, while fans hoped for a console release for years, Dissidia Final Fantasy originated on and was closely associated with Sony's PSP handheld system for its first two major entries before eventually coming to arcades and home consoles in a new form.
