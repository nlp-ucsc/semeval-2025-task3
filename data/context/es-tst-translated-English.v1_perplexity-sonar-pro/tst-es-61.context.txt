The Cubist movement popularized the basic technique of collage art in the early 20th century[2][5][8]. Specifically, Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, the pioneers of Cubism, are credited with introducing collage as a fine art technique around 1910-1912[2][5].

Picasso's "Still Life with Chair Caning" from 1912 is considered one of the earliest examples of modern collage in fine art[5][8]. This work incorporated oilcloth printed with a chair caning pattern and a piece of rope as a frame, alongside painted elements[2]. Similarly, Braque began experimenting with collage by incorporating bits of wallpaper and newspaper into his drawings and paintings[8].

The Cubists used collage to further explore their concept of fragmentation and multiple perspectives[2]. By incorporating real-world materials like newspaper clippings, wallpaper, and other found objects into their artworks, they challenged traditional notions of representation and expanded the boundaries of what could be considered fine art[2][5].

This innovative approach to art-making had a profound impact on subsequent art movements. The use of collage techniques spread rapidly to other avant-garde movements like Dada and Surrealism, and eventually influenced later 20th-century art movements such as Pop Art[5][6]. The Cubist introduction of collage marked a significant shift in artistic practice, blurring the lines between high art and everyday culture, and paving the way for new forms of artistic expression throughout the 20th century and beyond[2][5].
