The Isolobodon portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican hutia, is an extinct species of rodent[1][4]. It belonged to the family Capromyidae, which is a group of large rodents native to the Caribbean[1][3].

Key characteristics of the Isolobodon portoricensis include:

1. Classification: 
   - Kingdom: Animalia
   - Phylum: Chordata
   - Class: Mammalia
   - Order: Rodentia
   - Family: Capromyidae (some sources list Echimyidae)
   - Genus: Isolobodon
   - Species: I. portoricensis[1][4]

2. Distribution: The species was found on Hispaniola (present-day Dominican Republic and Haiti) and Gonâve Island. It was also introduced to Puerto Rico and some of the Virgin Islands[1].

3. Historical significance: The Puerto Rican hutia was an important food source for the Taíno people. It survived until the arrival of early European explorers, with Christopher Columbus and his crew believed to have consumed the species upon their arrival[1].

4. Extinction: The species declined following European colonization of the West Indies. Its extinction may have been caused by the introduction of black rats (Rattus rattus) by early European settlers around 1500, or possibly later by the introduction of small Indian mongooses (Urva auropunctata) in the 19th or early 20th century[1].

5. Current status: While commonly regarded as extinct, some researchers maintain hope that the species might still survive in undisturbed refuges[1][4].

The Puerto Rican hutia is an example of the significant impact human activities can have on island ecosystems, particularly through the introduction of non-native species and habitat destruction.
