The Battle of Svolder was fought in September 999 or 1000 in the western Baltic Sea between King Olaf Tryggvason of Norway and an alliance of his enemies[1][2]. The main participants were:

On one side:
1. King Olaf Tryggvason of Norway

On the other side, an alliance consisting of:
1. King Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark
2. King Olaf Skötkonung of Sweden
3. Norwegian jarls Eirik Hákonarson and Sven Hákonarson[1][2]

The battle was a result of various political and religious tensions in Scandinavia at the time. Olaf Tryggvason had been working to unify Norway under his rule and convert the country to Christianity, which had earned him many enemies[2]. The alliance against him was motivated by a combination of factors, including:

1. Territorial disputes: Denmark had claims on some southern regions of Norway[2].
2. Religious conflicts: Olaf's forceful Christianization of Norway was unpopular with some[2].
3. Personal vendettas: Olaf had offended several key figures, including Sigrid the Haughty, who later married Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark[2].

The battle was a decisive engagement in Scandinavian history, resulting in the defeat and death of Olaf Tryggvason and the subsequent division of Norway among the victors[1][4]. It also represented a significant naval conflict of the Viking Age, showcasing the naval warfare tactics of the time[1][2].
