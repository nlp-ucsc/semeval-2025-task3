Domantas Sabonis, son of basketball Hall of Famer Arvydas Sabonis, has been selected for the NBA All-Star Game three times in his career[5][9].

Sabonis earned his All-Star selections in the following years:

1. 2020 (with the Indiana Pacers)
2. 2021 (with the Indiana Pacers)
3. 2023 (with the Sacramento Kings)[1][5]

These selections reflect Sabonis' growth as a player and his increasing impact in the NBA. In the 2023 season, he not only made the All-Star team but was also named to his first All-NBA team (Third Team)[1]. This recognition came as he helped lead the Sacramento Kings to break their 16-season playoff drought, showcasing his importance to the team's success.

It's worth noting that Sabonis was considered a snub for the 2024 All-Star Game, despite averaging impressive numbers of 19.9 points, a league-leading 13.0 rebounds, and 8.0 assists per game at the time of selection[4]. This demonstrates that his level of play has remained consistently high, even when not selected for the All-Star team.

Interestingly, Domantas has now surpassed his father Arvydas in NBA All-Star selections. Arvydas Sabonis, despite being considered one of the greatest European players of all time, never made an NBA All-Star team, largely due to joining the NBA late in his career[6]. This achievement highlights Domantas' success in carving out his own legacy in the NBA, while still honoring his father's basketball heritage.
