Remains of the spade-toothed whale (Mesoplodon traversii) have been found exclusively in the South Pacific, with most specimens discovered in New Zealand and one in Chile[2][4]. Here are the key locations and details of the discoveries:

1. New Zealand:
   - Pitt Island, Chatham Islands: The first specimen, a lower jaw with teeth, was found here in 1872[4].
   - White Island: A calvaria (top of the skull) was discovered in the 1950s[4].
   - Opape Beach, Bay of Plenty: In December 2010, two complete specimens (a 5.3-meter cow and a 3.5-meter male calf) were found stranded here[4].
   - Taieri Mouth, Otago region: On July 4, 2024, a 5-meter male specimen washed ashore, providing the first opportunity for a complete dissection[2][3][4].

2. Chile:
   - Robinson Crusoe Island: A damaged calvaria was found washed up here in 1993[4].

These discoveries are significant because the spade-toothed whale is considered one of the rarest and least-known whale species in the world. Prior to the 2010 Opape Beach stranding, the species was known only from partial skull remains and teeth[1]. The 2024 Taieri Mouth specimen is particularly important as it allowed scientists to conduct the first-ever complete dissection of this species, revealing new insights into its anatomy and evolution[2][5].

The rarity of these findings is highlighted by the fact that as of 2024, only six confirmed specimens had been documented over a period of 150 years[2][4]. This scarcity of specimens has made the spade-toothed whale one of the most poorly understood large mammalian species of modern times[3].
