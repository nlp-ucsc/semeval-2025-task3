Möglingen, a municipality in the district of Ludwigsburg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany, has records of existence dating back to the 13th century. Specifically:

1. The first documented mention of Möglingen was in 1275 in a record from the Bishopric of Constance[1].

2. Shortly after, in 1278, it was mentioned again as "Meginingen" in a document of Count Ulrich of Asperg[1].

These early records indicate that Möglingen has a documented history spanning at least 750 years. During the 13th century, Möglingen was primarily under the control of the County Palatine of Tübingen. However, in 1308, the remaining stake in Möglingen was sold to the House of Württemberg[1].

The village's history continued to develop over the centuries:

- From the 14th century until 1807, Möglingen belonged to various administrative districts (Oberamt) within Württemberg[1].
- The village suffered significant damage and population loss during the Thirty Years' War in the 17th century[1].
- In subsequent wars, particularly in 1693, French troops destroyed 35 houses in Möglingen, including the town hall[1].

Today, Möglingen remains a municipality in Baden-Württemberg, situated about 13 km northwest of Stuttgart and 5 km west of Ludwigsburg[1].
