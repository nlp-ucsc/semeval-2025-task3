Alessandro Puccini practiced fencing[1][2]. Specifically, he competed in the foil discipline of fencing at the Olympic Games[1]. 

Puccini represented Italy in fencing at two Summer Olympics:

1. The 1992 Barcelona Olympics, where he competed in the men's team foil event[1].

2. The 1996 Atlanta Olympics, where he achieved his greatest success by winning the gold medal in the individual men's foil event[1][2].

In addition to his Olympic achievements, Puccini was affiliated with C.S. Carabinieri and CUS Pisa fencing clubs in Italy[1]. He began fencing at a young age, starting when he was 6 years old under the guidance of Maestro Antonio Di Ciolo[6].

Puccini's gold medal performance in Atlanta 1996 was particularly notable, as it was part of a strong showing by the Italian fencing team at those Olympics. Italy won multiple fencing medals in Atlanta, including gold medals in both individual foil (Puccini) and team épée events[3].
