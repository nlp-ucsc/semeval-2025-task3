Geoffroi de Villehardouin came from Villehardouin, a town in the Champagne region of France. Specifically:

- He was born around 1150 near Bar-sur-Aube in Burgundy, France[5].

- He was a French knight from the County of Champagne[4].

- His full title was "Geoffrey of Villehardouin, Marshal of Champagne and of Romania"[9].

- Villehardouin was a town in the Aube department in the Champagne-Ardenne region of northeastern France[8].

- He held the position of Marshal of Champagne as early as 1185[9].

Villehardouin was thus a nobleman from the Champagne region of France, taking his name from the town of Villehardouin where his family held lands. As a prominent member of the Champagne nobility, he served as Marshal of Champagne before joining the Fourth Crusade in 1199. His origins in the Champagne region shaped his role as one of the leaders of the French contingent in the Fourth Crusade.
