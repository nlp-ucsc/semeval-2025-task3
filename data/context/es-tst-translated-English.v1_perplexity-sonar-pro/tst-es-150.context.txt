The municipality of Yushu, located in Qinghai Province, China, is situated at a high altitude of approximately 3,700 meters (12,100 feet) above sea level[1][5]. This elevation places Yushu in the category of high-altitude cities, contributing to its unique climate and geographical characteristics.

Some key points about Yushu's altitude and location:

1. City center: The main urban area, specifically the town of GyÃªgu (also known as Yushu or Jiegu), is built in the valley of the Batang River at an elevation of around 3,700 meters[1].

2. Surrounding area: The broader Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, of which Yushu city is a part, has an average elevation of more than 4,200 meters (13,780 feet)[2].

3. Climate impact: Due to its high altitude, Yushu experiences an alpine subarctic climate with long, cold winters and short, mild summers[1].

4. Geographical context: Yushu is located in the eastern part of the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, which is characterized by high plateaus and mountain ranges[5].

5. Elevation range: Within the Yushu City administrative area, elevations range from 3,350 meters at the lowest point to 5,752 meters at the highest peak[5].

This high-altitude location significantly influences Yushu's environment, climate, and the adaptations of its inhabitants to life at such elevations.
