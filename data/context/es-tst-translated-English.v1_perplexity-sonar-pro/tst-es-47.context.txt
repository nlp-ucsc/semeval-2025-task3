DOT 4 brake fluid has both a dry and wet boiling point, which are important specifications for its performance and safety in braking systems.

The dry boiling point of DOT 4 brake fluid is typically around 446°F (230°C)[1][9]. This refers to the temperature at which fresh, unopened brake fluid will begin to boil. The dry boiling point is higher than that of DOT 3 fluid, making DOT 4 more suitable for high-performance applications and vehicles subject to more demanding braking conditions.

The wet boiling point of DOT 4 brake fluid is generally around 311°F (155°C)[1][9]. This is the temperature at which the fluid will boil after it has absorbed 3.7% water by volume[3]. The wet boiling point is crucial because brake fluid naturally absorbs moisture over time, which can affect its performance.

It's important to note that these values can vary slightly between different manufacturers and specific formulations. Some high-performance or "Super DOT 4" fluids may have even higher boiling points. For example:

- Pentosin's Super DOT 4 fluid has a dry boiling point of 509°F (265°C) and a wet boiling point of 329°F (165°C)[4].
- Textar DOT 4 LV fluid boasts a dry boiling point of 511.8°F (266°C) and a wet boiling point of 339.8°F (171°C)[4].
- ATE SL.6 fluid, which can replace Super DOT 4, has a dry boiling point of 509°F (265°C) and a wet boiling point of 347°F (175°C)[4].

The higher boiling points of DOT 4 fluid compared to DOT 3 provide an additional safety margin against vapor lock, which can occur when the brake fluid boils and creates gas bubbles in the brake lines, potentially leading to brake failure[2]. This makes DOT 4 fluid particularly suitable for vehicles with anti-lock braking systems (ABS), those used in high-altitude conditions, or for towing applications[9].

It's crucial to replace DOT 4 brake fluid regularly, typically every two years, as it absorbs moisture faster than DOT 3 fluid[1][7]. This regular maintenance helps ensure that the brake system continues to perform optimally and safely.
