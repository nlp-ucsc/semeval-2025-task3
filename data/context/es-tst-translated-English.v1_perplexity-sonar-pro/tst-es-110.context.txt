The full name of the founder of "El Mercurio de Valparaíso" is Pedro Félix Vicuña[3]. Pedro Félix Vicuña founded this Chilean newspaper on September 12, 1827[1][3].

El Mercurio de Valparaíso holds a significant place in the history of Spanish-language journalism, as it is considered the oldest continuously circulating periodical published under the same name in the Spanish language[1]. The newspaper is based in Valparaíso, Chile, and has played an important role in the country's media landscape for nearly two centuries[1].

It's worth noting that Pedro Félix Vicuña was the father of Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna, a prominent Chilean historian and politician[2]. This connection highlights the newspaper's roots in a family with significant influence in Chilean society and politics.

After its founding by Pedro Félix Vicuña, the ownership of El Mercurio de Valparaíso changed hands. In 1880, it was acquired by Agustín Edwards Ross, marking the beginning of the Edwards family's long association with the newspaper[2]. This acquisition would eventually lead to the expansion of the El Mercurio brand, including the founding of the Santiago edition of El Mercurio by Agustín Edwards Mac Clure, son of Edwards Ross, on June 1, 1900[2].
