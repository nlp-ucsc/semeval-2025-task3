The global mountain-building phase in which the Alps were formed is called the Alpine orogeny[2][4]. This orogenic event occurred during the Late Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras, primarily as a result of the collision between the African and Eurasian tectonic plates[1][3].

The Alpine orogeny is responsible for creating not just the Alps, but a vast mountain belt known as the Alpide belt, which stretches from the Atlantic Ocean to the Himalayas[2]. This mountain-building phase formed numerous mountain ranges across Europe and Asia, including:

- The Atlas Mountains
- The Pyrenees
- The Alps
- The Carpathians
- The Caucasus
- The Zagros Mountains
- The Hindu Kush
- The Himalayas

The process began around 100 million years ago when the African and European plates collided, forcing rocks upwards[1]. The main phases of mountain building occurred from the Paleocene to the Eocene epochs, and the process continues to some extent in certain Alpide mountain ranges today[2].

The Alpine orogeny is considered one of the three major phases of orogeny that defined Europe's geology, along with the earlier Caledonian and Hercynian (or Variscan) orogenies[2]. It not only created towering mountain ranges but also had far-reaching effects, influencing geological features as distant as southern England and Sweden[2][4].
