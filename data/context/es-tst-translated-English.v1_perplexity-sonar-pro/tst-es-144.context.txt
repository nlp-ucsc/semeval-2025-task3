The main rival of HJK Helsinki is HIFK Fotboll, also based in Helsinki. This rivalry is known as the Stadin derby or Helsinki derby[3][4]. Some key points about this rivalry include:

1. Historical significance: The rivalry dates back to 1909 when the two teams first faced each other[4].

2. Cultural divide: Historically, HJK was associated with the Finnish-speaking middle class, while HIFK represented the Swedish-speaking middle class. However, the language aspect has become less significant over time[4].

3. Local supremacy: The winner of the derby fixtures in a season is awarded the "Stadin herruus" trophy, which translates to "the mastership of Helsinki"[4].

4. Supporter groups: HJK's main supporter groups are Forza HJK and Sakilaiset, while HIFK's renowned supporter group is called Stadin kingit (Kings of Helsinki)[4].

5. Recent history: The teams hadn't faced each other in the top flight from 1972 until 2015 when HIFK was promoted back to the Veikkausliiga[3][4].

6. Current status: As of January 2024, HIFK Fotboll declared bankruptcy and will operate in the fifth tier of Finnish football, which may impact the immediate future of this rivalry[4].

While HJK has other rivalries, such as with FC Lahti and Valkeakosken Haka[3], the Stadin derby against HIFK is considered the most significant due to its long history and local nature.
