Karen Percy is recognized in the sport of alpine skiing. One of her most notable achievements is winning two bronze medals for Canada at the 1988 Olympic Winter Games in Calgary[1][10].

Karen Percy competed in alpine skiing at the highest level, representing Canada in international competitions. Her Olympic success in 1988 was particularly significant as she won Canada's first medals of those Games, which were held on home soil[1][10]. Specifically, Percy won bronze medals in two events:

1. Women's Downhill
2. Women's Super-G (Super Giant Slalom)

These achievements were especially impressive considering that Percy had undergone thumb surgery just four weeks before the Olympics[1][10]. Her performance made her a national hero and marked Canada's first double medalist in skiing since Nancy Greene at the 1968 Grenoble Olympics[1].

Throughout her career, Percy demonstrated versatility by competing in all alpine disciplines rather than specializing[1]. She was a member of the Canadian national team from 1984 to 1990, during which time she had 45 World Cup starts with five podium finishes and 33 top-10 finishes[1]. She also competed in four World Championships, earning a silver medal in the downhill event in 1989[1][10].

Percy's success and contributions to Canadian sport have been widely recognized. She was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1994, the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame in 1995, and was made a Member of the Order of Canada in 1988[1][10].
