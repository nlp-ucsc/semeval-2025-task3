International Klein Blue (IKB) is a deep, vibrant ultramarine hue created by French artist Yves Klein in collaboration with Parisian art paint supplier Edouard Adam[1][2]. The color was developed in 1956 and officially registered in France on May 19, 1960, under Soleau envelope no. 63471[1].

The uniqueness of IKB lies in its composition:

1. Pigment: It uses a pure, dry ultramarine pigment[2].
2. Binder: The key component is a matte, synthetic resin binder that suspends the color particles[1][2].
3. Formula: The binder is a polyvinyl acetate developed by the French pharmaceutical company Rh√¥ne-Poulenc, marketed as Rhodopas M or M60A[1].

The special binder allows the pigment to maintain its original intensity and vivid hue, creating a striking visual impact[1][2]. This unique combination gives IKB its characteristic powdery appearance and light hue, closely resembling the look of pastel heavily laid on sanded paper[4].

Klein's inspiration for IKB came from several sources:

1. Mediterranean skies: His love for blue began with the deep cerulean skies of the French Mediterranean[5].
2. Italian frescoes: Early travels to Italy exposed him to rich blues in basilica frescoes[2].
3. Religious symbolism: As a Catholic, Klein saw religious significance in blue, traditionally used for the Virgin Mary's robes in Renaissance paintings[2].

IKB became central to Klein's artistic practice:

1. Monochrome works: In 1957, Klein held an exhibition featuring 11 identical blue canvases painted solely in IKB[6].
2. Diverse applications: He used IKB on various objects, including sponges, globes, and busts[5].
3. Performance art: Klein incorporated IKB in performances, such as his Anthropometry series where nude models covered in IKB paint created imprints on canvases[8].

The legacy of IKB extends beyond Klein's lifetime, continuing to influence art and design. Today, the pigment has been recreated by French paint manufacturer Ressource, allowing artists to continue using this iconic color in their work[2].
