Oudalan Province in Burkina Faso borders two countries:

1. Mali to the north[1][7]
2. Niger to the east[1][7]

Oudalan is located in the northeastern part of Burkina Faso, in the Sahel Region[1]. It is one of the 45 provinces of Burkina Faso and shares international borders with both Mali and Niger[1][7]. The province's strategic location makes it part of the tri-border area between Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, which has been facing security challenges in recent years[9][10].

Some key details about Oudalan Province:

- Capital: Gorom-Gorom[1][2]
- Area: 9,797 square kilometers[2]
- Population: 158,146 (as of 2019 census)[1]
- Administrative divisions: The province is divided into 5 departments - DÃ©ou, Gorom-Gorom, Markoye, Oursi, and Tin-Akoff[1][5]

Its location in the Sahel region means that Oudalan has a semi-arid climate and is part of the transition zone between the Sahara Desert to the north and the tropical savanna to the south[3]. This geographical position contributes to the province's unique environmental and socio-economic challenges.
