Gordon Strachan's last coaching position was as the manager of the Scotland national team[7][8][9]. He held this role from January 2013 until October 2017[4][7]. During his tenure as Scotland's manager, Strachan oversaw 40 matches, achieving 19 wins, 9 draws, and 12 losses, resulting in a win percentage of 47.50%[10].

Strachan's time as Scotland's manager was marked by some notable performances, particularly against teams like Ireland and England[1]. However, he ultimately resigned in October 2017 after failing to qualify for the 2018 World Cup and having previously not qualified for Euro 2016[2].

Since stepping down from the Scotland national team, Strachan has not taken on any other managerial positions. His career in football management has included stints at several clubs before the Scotland job, including Coventry City, Southampton, Celtic, and Middlesbrough[7][10].
