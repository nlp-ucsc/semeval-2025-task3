The Second Council of Nicaea, held in 787 A.D., approved 22 disciplinary canons relating to various points of church discipline[1][4][10]. These canons addressed a wide range of ecclesiastical matters, including:

1. Admission and conduct of clergy
2. Rules for ordination
3. Living arrangements for clergy
4. Episcopal elections
5. Treatment of excommunicated persons
6. Penance for apostates
7. Regulations on clergy moving between churches
8. Prohibition on clergy lending money at interest
9. Placement of relics in churches
10. Handling of writings against venerated images
11. Management of church property
12. Dress codes for clergy

The canons covered both practical and spiritual aspects of church governance, aiming to maintain order, discipline, and proper conduct among the clergy and in church affairs. These disciplinary measures were enacted alongside the council's primary purpose of resolving the Iconoclastic Controversy and affirming the veneration of holy images[3].
