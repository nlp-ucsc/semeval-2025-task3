Albert Lebrun was born on August 29, 1871 in Mercy-le-Haut, France[1][2]. Mercy-le-Haut is a commune located in the Meurthe-et-Moselle department in northeastern France[1][2].

Some additional details about Lebrun's early life and background:

1. He was born into a farming family in this rural area of Lorraine[1][2].

2. Lebrun received his education at a lyceum (secondary school) in Nancy, which is the capital city of Meurthe-et-Moselle[4].

3. He went on to attend the prestigious École Polytechnique and École des Mines de Paris, graduating at the top of his class from both institutions[1][2].

4. Before entering politics, Lebrun worked as a mining engineer in the cities of Vesoul and Nancy[1][2].

5. At the age of 29, he left his engineering career to pursue politics, winning a seat in the Chamber of Deputies in 1900 as a member of the Left Republican Party[1][2].

Lebrun's birthplace in Mercy-le-Haut and his roots in the Lorraine region played a significant role in shaping his early career and political trajectory, as he went on to serve as a representative for Lorraine and later as a senator from Meurthe-et-Moselle before eventually becoming the President of France in 1932[1][2][4].
