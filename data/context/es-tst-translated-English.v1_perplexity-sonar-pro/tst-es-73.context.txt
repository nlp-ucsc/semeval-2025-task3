The common name for the imperial throne of Japan used during the Heian period is the Chrysanthemum Throne (皇位, kōi)[1]. More specifically, the actual physical throne used in enthronement ceremonies during this era was called the Takamikura (高御座)[1][3].

The Takamikura is an elaborate raised platform that has been used since the Heian period for imperial enthronement ceremonies[3]. It is considered the oldest surviving throne used by the Japanese monarchy[1]. Some key details about the Takamikura include:

1. It sits on an octagonal dais, elevated 5 meters (16 ft) above the floor[1].
2. It is separated from the rest of the room by a curtain[1].
3. The current model was built in 1912 for the enthronement of Emperor Taishō[1][3].
4. It is 6.5 meters high and weighs 8 tons[3].
5. A sliding door called the kenjō no shōji (賢聖障子) hides the Emperor from view and has an image of 32 celestial saints painted on it[1].

The term "Chrysanthemum Throne" is also used more broadly as a metonym for the Japanese monarchy itself, encompassing not just the physical throne but the institution and lineage of Japanese emperors[1]. This usage likely developed because the chrysanthemum is a symbol closely associated with the Japanese imperial family.

During the Heian period (794-1185), the imperial court was based in Heian-kyō (modern-day Kyoto)[4][5]. This era saw the refinement of Japanese culture from an aristocratic perspective, with flourishing art, literature, and other cultural pursuits[2]. The imperial system, symbolized by the Chrysanthemum Throne, played a central role in the political and cultural life of Heian Japan, even as actual political power was often wielded by influential noble families like the Fujiwara[5][10].
