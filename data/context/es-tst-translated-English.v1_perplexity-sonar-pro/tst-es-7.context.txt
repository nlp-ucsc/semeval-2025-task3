The second highest hill in Lithuania is Kruopinė Hill, also known as Žybartonys Hill. Its elevation is 293.65 meters (963.4 feet) above sea level[1][5].

Some key details about Kruopinė Hill:

1. Location: It is located near Vilnius, the capital city of Lithuania[1].

2. Former status: Kruopinė Hill was previously believed to be the highest point in Lithuania before more accurate measurements were taken[1].

3. Current ranking: It is now recognized as the second highest point in the country, after Aukštojas Hill[5].

4. Measurement: The elevation was determined in 2007 when staff at Vilnius Gediminas Technical University remeasured the peaks using GPS technology[1].
