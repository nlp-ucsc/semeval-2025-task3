Magnar Solberg participated in the Olympic Games twice, competing in the sport of biathlon[1][2]. Here are the key details of his Olympic appearances:

1. 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France:
   - Won gold medal in the 20 km individual event[1][2]
   - Won silver medal as part of Norway's 4 × 7.5 km relay team[1][2]

2. 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Japan:
   - Successfully defended his gold medal in the 20 km individual event[1][2]
   - Finished 4th with Norway's 4 × 7.5 km relay team[1][2]

Solberg's achievements were particularly notable because:

- He was the first biathlete to defend the Olympic gold medal in the individual event[1]
- He remains the only biathlete to win the 20 km event twice, which was the original Olympic biathlon event[1]
- At the 1972 Winter Olympics, he served as the Olympic flag bearer for Norway at the opening ceremony[2]

Solberg's success in biathlon was remarkable considering he was a relative newcomer to international competition when he won his first gold medal at age 31[4][9]. His performances in 1968 and 1972 cemented his place as one of the greatest biathletes in Olympic history.
