I apologize, but I don't have accurate information to confirm that "Tuck Everlasting" was translated into Spanish as "El Misterio de los Tucks" for the movie version. The search results provided don't contain any information about the Spanish title of the movie adaptation.

However, I can provide some relevant information about the Spanish translation of the book:

The Spanish translation of the novel "Tuck Everlasting" by Natalie Babbitt is titled "Tuck para siempre"[1][2][3]. This translates to "Tuck Forever" in English, which closely aligns with the original title's meaning. The Spanish edition is a paperback published by Square Fish and translated by Narcis Fradera[2][6].

The book tells the story of the Tuck family, who gain eternal life after drinking from a magical spring. It explores themes of immortality and its consequences. The Spanish translation has received praise, with Harper's calling it "Probably the best work of our best children's novelist"[1][2].

It's worth noting that book titles and movie titles can sometimes differ in their translations, so it's possible that the movie could have a different Spanish title than the book. However, I don't have concrete information about the Spanish title of the movie adaptation based on the provided search results.
