The Veryovkina Cave is located in Abkhazia, which is a disputed region[1][2][3]. Abkhazia is internationally recognized as part of Georgia, but it operates as a de facto independent state supported by Russia[4].

Specifically, Veryovkina Cave is situated in the Arabika Massif, within the Gagra mountain range of the Western Caucasus[2]. It lies on the pass between the Krepost and Zont mountains, close to the slopes of Mount Krepost[2]. The cave's entrance is at an elevation of 2,285 meters (7,497 ft) above sea level[2].

It's important to note that while Abkhazia claims independence, most of the international community, including the United Nations, considers it to be part of Georgia[1][2][3]. This geopolitical situation creates some complexity when discussing the cave's location.

Veryovkina Cave is renowned for being the deepest known cave on Earth, with a confirmed depth of 2,212 meters (7,257 feet)[1][2][4]. It's part of a remarkable geological area that includes several other extremely deep caves, making the Arabika Massif a significant location for speleological research and exploration[3][4].
