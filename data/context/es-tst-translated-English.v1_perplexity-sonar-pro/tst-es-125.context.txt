The number 41 can be expressed as the sum of two squares in the following way:

41 = 4² + 5²

This means:
41 = 16 + 25

To break it down further:
- 4 squared (4 × 4) equals 16
- 5 squared (5 × 5) equals 25
- The sum of these two squared numbers (16 + 25) equals 41

This representation of 41 as a sum of two squares is consistent with Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares[10]. The theorem states that an odd prime p can be expressed as the sum of two squares if and only if p is congruent to 1 modulo 4. Indeed, 41 is a prime number, and it is congruent to 1 modulo 4 (since 41 ÷ 4 leaves a remainder of 1).

It's worth noting that for prime numbers like 41, there is only one unique way to express them as the sum of two squares, disregarding the order of the terms[9]. This means that 5² + 4² is considered the same representation as 4² + 5².
