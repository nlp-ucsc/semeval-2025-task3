Cape Verde has participated in eight editions of the Summer Olympic Games. The country made its Olympic debut in 1996 and has competed in every Summer Olympics since then[1][2]. Here's a breakdown of Cape Verde's Olympic participation:

1. 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, USA (debut)
2. 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia
3. 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece
4. 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China
5. 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom
6. 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
7. 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan (held in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic)
8. 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, France

It's worth noting that Cape Verde has never participated in the Winter Olympic Games[1][2]. The country's National Olympic Committee, Comité Olímpico Cabo-verdiano, was formed in 1989 and officially recognized by the International Olympic Committee in September 1993[1].

Throughout these eight Olympic appearances, Cape Verde has been represented by athletes in various sports, including athletics, boxing, judo, rhythmic gymnastics, swimming, and taekwondo[1]. The country's participation has gradually increased over the years, with six athletes competing in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics[1][4].

Notably, Cape Verde achieved a significant milestone in the 2024 Paris Olympics when boxer Daniel Varela de Pina won the bronze medal in the Men's 51 kg category, marking the country's first-ever Olympic medal[2][4][5].
