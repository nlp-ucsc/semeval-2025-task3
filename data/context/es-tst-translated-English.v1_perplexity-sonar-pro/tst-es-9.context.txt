Sophie Nélisse played the role of Liesel Meminger in the 2013 film "The Book Thief"[1][4]. This movie was an adaptation of the best-selling novel of the same name by Markus Zusak. 

In the film, Nélisse portrays Liesel, a young girl living in Nazi Germany during World War II. The story follows Liesel as she finds solace in books and words during the difficult times of the war. Her foster parents, played by Geoffrey Rush (Hans Hubermann) and Emily Watson (Rosa Hubermann), take her in and later hide a Jewish refugee in their basement[1].

The film was directed by Brian Percival, and Nélisse was chosen for the lead role after an extensive worldwide search[5]. Her performance was well-received, earning her several accolades including the Satellite Award for Breakthrough Performance and the Young Artist Award for Best Leading Young Actress in a Feature Film[4].

"The Book Thief" marked a significant milestone in Nélisse's career, as it was her first major international role. Prior to this, she had gained recognition for her performance in the Canadian film "Monsieur Lazhar" (2011)[4]. Her portrayal of Liesel Meminger in "The Book Thief" helped establish her as a talented young actress capable of holding her own alongside veteran performers like Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson[6].
