The Party for a Free Life in Kurdistan (PJAK) is primarily active in the following countries:

1. Iran: PJAK was founded in 2004 as an Iranian equivalent to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and has waged an intermittent armed struggle against the Iranian government since then[1][2]. The group operates mainly in Kurdish-inhabited areas of Iran, which Kurds refer to as Rojhelat or Eastern Kurdistan[2].

2. Iraq: PJAK maintains bases in the Qandil Mountains along the Iran-Iraq border[1][4]. These strategic mountainous areas serve as a stronghold for the group's operations.

3. Germany: The group's leader, Abdul Rahman Haji Ahmadi, is said to reside in Germany and control PJAK's operations from there[1][4].

While PJAK's primary focus is on Iran, it is important to note that the organization is part of a larger network of Kurdish groups:

- PJAK is affiliated with the Kurdistan Communities Union (KCK), an alliance of Kurdish groups that includes the PKK (active in Turkey), the PYD (active in Syria), and the PCDK (active in Iraq)[4].

- The group shares leadership, logistics, and allegiance with the PKK, effectively making them "one and the same" according to some sources, with the main difference being their area of operations[1].

It's worth noting that PJAK has been designated as a terrorist organization by Iran, Turkey, and the United States[1][4]. The group's activities and presence in these countries have led to tensions and conflicts, particularly with Iranian security forces.
