Argentina won the FIFA World Cup in 2022 with Lionel Messi as the team captain[6][9]. This was Argentina's third World Cup title overall, and their first since 1986[6]. 

Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup held in Qatar, defeating France in the final[2]. This achievement was particularly significant as it marked Argentina's first World Cup victory in 36 years[2]. 

During this tournament, Messi set several records:

1. He became the first player to score in every stage of the World Cup[2].
2. He scored a total of seven goals and provided three assists throughout the tournament[2].
3. He won the Golden Ball award for the best player of the tournament for the second time, becoming the first player to achieve this feat[2].
4. He set a new record for the most appearances in World Cup matches (26)[2][7].
5. He also set a record for the most direct goal contributions in World Cup history (21 â€“ 13 goals and 8 assists)[2].

This World Cup victory was a crowning achievement in Messi's international career, coming after several near misses, including a runner-up finish in the 2014 World Cup[2]. It solidified his legacy as one of the greatest players in football history and fulfilled his long-standing dream of winning the World Cup for Argentina.
