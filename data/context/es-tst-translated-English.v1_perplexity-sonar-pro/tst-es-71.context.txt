The last major feature film starring Frances Farmer was "Son of Fury: The Story of Benjamin Blake" released in 1942[1][2]. This period swashbuckler film starred Tyrone Power, with Farmer portraying the role of Isabel Blake[2][4].

After "Son of Fury," Farmer's film career essentially came to an end due to her mounting personal troubles and struggles with mental health. She had a small, uncredited role in the 1943 film "I Escaped from the Gestapo" (also known as "No Escape" in the UK), but this was only a brief appearance in a montage sequence[2][4].

Following her Hollywood career, Farmer did make some television appearances in the late 1950s, including roles in shows like "Studio One," "Matinee Theatre," and "Playhouse 90"[2][4]. Her final on-screen appearance was in the 1958 film "The Party Crashers," where she played a character named Mrs. Bickford[2][4].

It's worth noting that after leaving Hollywood, Farmer hosted a local daytime TV program called "Frances Farmer Presents" in Indianapolis from 1958 to 1964, but this was not an acting role[1][2].
