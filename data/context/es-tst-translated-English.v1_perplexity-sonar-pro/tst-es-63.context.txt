Hassan Rouhani won the Iranian presidential election held on June 14, 2013[1][4]. Here are the key details about his victory:

- Rouhani received 18,613,329 votes, which accounted for 50.71% of all votes cast[1]. This narrow majority allowed him to avoid a runoff election.

- He won decisively, securing 52.49% of the valid votes[1].

- The runner-up was Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, who received 17.14% of the votes[1].

- Voter turnout was high, with 72.71% of eligible voters participating[1][4].

- Rouhani was considered the most moderate candidate among those allowed to run[5][6].

Some additional points about the election:

- The Guardian Council had initially screened 680 registered candidates, approving only 8 to run in the election[1].

- Rouhani's victory was seen as surprising by some analysts, given the systematic purging of moderates and reformists from the Iranian political system in the preceding decade[5][6].

- His win was interpreted as a sign that Iranian voters desired change, both in domestic policies and in Iran's relationship with the international community[5][6].

- As a former nuclear negotiator, Rouhani was seen as potentially more open to dialogue on Iran's nuclear program, though the Supreme Leader would still have the final say on major policy decisions[5][6].

This election marked a shift towards a more moderate leadership in Iran, with potential implications for both domestic policies and international relations.
