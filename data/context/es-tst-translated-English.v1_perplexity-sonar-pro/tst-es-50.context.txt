Each orbital cavity in an adult human is formed by seven bones:

1. Frontal bone[1][3][5]
2. Sphenoid bone[1][3][5]
3. Zygomatic bone[1][3][5]
4. Maxilla[1][3][5]
5. Ethmoid bone[1][3][5]
6. Lacrimal bone[1][3][5]
7. Palatine bone[1][3][5]

These seven bones collectively form the complex structure of the orbit, which houses and protects the eyeball and associated structures. Each bone contributes to different parts of the orbital cavity:

- The frontal bone forms the roof (superior wall) of the orbit[1][3].
- The sphenoid bone contributes to multiple areas, including part of the roof, lateral wall, and apex of the orbit[1][3].
- The zygomatic bone forms part of the lateral wall and floor[1][3].
- The maxilla contributes to the floor and part of the medial wall[1][3].
- The ethmoid bone forms a significant portion of the medial wall[1][3].
- The lacrimal bone is a small bone in the anterior part of the medial wall[1][3].
- The palatine bone contributes a small portion to the posterior part of the orbital floor[1][3].

The arrangement of these bones creates a pear-shaped cavity with the wider part facing anteriorly (towards the face) and the narrower part pointing posteriorly (towards the back of the skull)[1]. This structure provides protection for the eye and allows space for the associated muscles, nerves, and blood vessels that support ocular function.
