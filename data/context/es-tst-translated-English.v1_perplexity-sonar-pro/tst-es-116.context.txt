Fuligo septica, commonly known as dog vomit slime mold or scrambled egg slime mold, typically appears in bright yellow or yellowish-tan colors, but its coloration can vary[1][2][3]. Here are the key points about its color:

1. Primary color: The most common and noticeable color of Fuligo septica is bright yellow[1][2]. This vivid yellow hue is what often draws attention to it in gardens and mulched areas.

2. Color variations: While yellow is the most typical color, Fuligo septica can also appear in other shades, including:
   - Tan
   - Whitish
   - Orange
   - Rarely, it can even be blue[5]

3. Color changes over time: The color of Fuligo septica is not static and changes as it progresses through its life cycle:
   - It starts as a bright yellow, fluffy or foamy-looking mass[3].
   - As it matures, it may develop dark red liquefied areas, making it look like it's bleeding[1].
   - Over time, it dries out and becomes crusty, turning darker shades of tan, brown, or even black[1][3].

4. Descriptive names: Its color and appearance have inspired several descriptive common names:
   - "Scrambled egg slime" due to its yellow, fluffy texture[2].
   - "Flowers of tan" because of its yellowish, bile-colored appearance[7].

5. Rare colors: While green is a common color in nature, it's rarely seen in Fuligo septica[5].

The variable coloration of Fuligo septica, combined with its unusual texture and rapid appearance, often makes it a subject of curiosity and sometimes concern for gardeners and homeowners. However, despite its sometimes alarming appearance, it's a harmless and fascinating organism that plays a role in decomposing organic matter in the environment[1][2][5].
