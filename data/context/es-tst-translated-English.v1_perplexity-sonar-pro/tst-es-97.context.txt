The horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) is native to the Balkan Peninsula in southeastern Europe[1][2][4]. Specifically, its native distribution includes:

1. Albania
2. Bulgaria
3. Greece (particularly the Pindos Mountains)
4. North Macedonia
5. Parts of the former Yugoslavia

The species has a particularly limited native range in Bulgaria, where it is found in a small area of about 9 hectares in the Preslav Mountain north of the Balkan Mountains[1]. This population is considered critically endangered and is protected as part of the Dervisha Managed Nature Reserve.

It's worth noting that the horse chestnut was once more widespread in Europe during the Early Pleistocene, about 1 million years ago[4]. Its current restricted native range is likely due to climate changes and possibly the extinction of large mammals that may have acted as seed dispersers.

Despite its limited native range, the horse chestnut has been widely introduced and planted around the world since the 17th century[2]. It was first brought to other parts of Europe, with early introductions in France (1615) and London (1633)[2]. Today, it can be found in many parts of Europe, North America, and other temperate regions, where it is commonly planted in parks, gardens, and along streets for its ornamental value[1][3].
