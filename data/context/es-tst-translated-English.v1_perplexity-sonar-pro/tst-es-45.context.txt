Queen's College Cork was established in 1845 and later evolved into the modern University College Cork (UCC). Here's a detailed overview of its history and development:

## Founding and Early Years

Queen's College Cork was founded as part of the Queen's Colleges Act of 1845[1][2]. The college formally came into existence on December 30, 1845, by a royal charter of incorporation[2]. It was one of three Queen's Colleges established in Ireland at that time, with the others located in Belfast and Galway[1].

The college officially opened its doors to students in 1849[2]. Sir Robert Kane, the first president, declared at the opening that "Here, after nearly a thousand years, we open now the portals of this edifice and accept the task of training the youth of Munster"[2]. In its inaugural year, 115 students enrolled, with Richard Bullen, son of the first professor of surgery, becoming the first registered student[2].

## Development and Challenges

Throughout the 1850s and 1860s, the college continued to grow and develop. However, a significant event occurred on May 15, 1862, when the West Wing of the Quadrangle was almost completely destroyed by fire[2][3][4]. This incident sparked numerous conspiracy theories, and despite a reward of £150 being offered for information, the true cause of the fire was never conclusively determined[2].

## Transition to University College Cork

In 1908, a major change occurred with the passing of the Irish Universities Act. This legislation abolished the Royal University and established the National University of Ireland[2]. As a result, Queen's College Cork was transformed into University College Cork (UCC)[2].

## 20th Century Growth

Throughout the 20th century, UCC continued to expand and evolve:

1. In 1910, Mary Ryan became the first female professor in Ireland when she was appointed Professor of Romance Languages at UCC[2].
2. The Mardyke Athletic Grounds were acquired in 1911[2].
3. The iconic Honan Chapel was built in 1916[2].
4. In 1934, the statue of Queen Victoria on the Aula Maxima was replaced with a statue of St. Finbarr, reflecting the changing political climate in Ireland[2].

## Modern Era

UCC has continued to grow and develop in the 21st century:

1. In 2017, the university announced a €350 million investment plan for campus infrastructure development[2].
2. The university has gained recognition for its impact on sustainability, ranking 8th in the world in the Times Higher Education Impact Rankings in 2021[2].
3. As of 2022, UCC had 24,195 students, including 16,849 undergraduates and 7,346 postgraduates[1].

Today, University College Cork is a constituent university of the National University of Ireland and continues to be a prominent institution of higher education in Ireland[1].
