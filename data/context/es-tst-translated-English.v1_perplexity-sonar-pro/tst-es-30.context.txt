The three protagonists in the American movie "Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!" are:

1. Varla, played by Tura Satana
2. Rosie, played by Haji
3. Billie, played by Lori Williams

These three characters are go-go dancers who embark on a violent adventure in the California desert[1][2][4]. Varla is the leader of the group, described as a karate expert and the most aggressive of the three[1]. Rosie is often portrayed as Varla's lover and somewhat subservient to her[1]. Billie is characterized as the more reluctant member of the trio, possessing some redeeming qualities compared to the other two[1][6].

The film, directed by Russ Meyer and released in 1965, follows these three women as they encounter a young couple, commit murder, kidnap the girlfriend (Linda), and then scheme to rob an old man they believe is hiding a fortune[2][4]. Their violent and sexually charged escapade forms the core of this cult classic, which has been described as "the best movie ever made" by filmmaker John Waters[7].
