The F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon) series consists of several main games, expansions, and a spin-off. Here's a breakdown of the sequels and expansions that were marketed:

Main Games:
1. F.E.A.R. (2005) - The original game[1][3]
2. F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin (2009)[1]
3. F.E.A.R. 3 (2011)[1]

Expansions:
1. F.E.A.R. Extraction Point (2006) - Standalone expansion for the first game[1][3]
2. F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate (2007) - Second standalone expansion for the first game[1][3]
3. F.E.A.R. 2: Reborn (2009) - DLC for F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin[1]

Spin-off:
1. F.E.A.R. Online (2014) - A free-to-play game that was shut down in 2015 while still in open beta[1]

Special Editions:
1. F.E.A.R. Gold Edition (2007) - Includes the original game and Extraction Point expansion[3]
2. F.E.A.R. Platinum Collection (2007) - Includes the original game, Extraction Point, and Perseus Mandate[3]
3. F.E.A.R. Files (2007) - An Xbox 360 release that bundled Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate[3]

In total, there were 3 main games, 3 expansions (including the DLC for F.E.A.R. 2), and 1 spin-off game marketed in the F.E.A.R. series. It's worth noting that the expansions Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate are no longer considered canon, as their plots were ignored in the sequels Project Origin and F.E.A.R. 3[1][3].
