The Fens, a low-lying marshland region in eastern England, is protected from flooding through an extensive and complex system of flood management infrastructure and practices:

1. Drainage channels: A network of man-made rivers, drains, and channels helps to direct water away from the land[1][4]. This includes straightened rivers like the Old Bedford River, which was dug in 1630 to channel water towards the sea[2].

2. Embankments and flood defenses: The area is protected by 405 kilometers of river embankments and 95 kilometers of coastal defenses[3]. These structures help contain water and prevent it from flooding the surrounding land.

3. Sluice gates: Strategically placed sluice gates control water flow and help keep tides out of the inland areas[2][3].

4. Pumping stations: There are 138 pumping stations across the Fens[3]. These stations actively pump water from low-lying areas into higher rivers, helping to keep the drained land dry[2][4].

5. Flood storage reservoirs: Large areas called "washes" are used to store flood waters during times of high water levels. The Ouse Washes, for example, is the third-largest flood storage reservoir in England and can hold up to 19 million cubic meters of water[4].

6. Ongoing management: Organizations like the Environment Agency, Internal Drainage Boards, and local authorities continuously maintain and manage these flood protection assets[5][7].

7. Long-term planning: Programs like "Fens 2100+" are being developed to adapt the flood management approach to future challenges, including climate change[1][3].

8. Investment: Significant ongoing investment is required to maintain and improve flood defenses. For example, approximately Â£230 million of capital funding is needed between now and 2031/32 to sustain existing flood protection assets[5].

9. Emergency response systems: In case of imminent flooding, there are warning systems in place, including the use of church bells to alert residents in some areas[8].

10. Land use management: Careful management of agricultural practices and land use helps mitigate flood risks and maintain the drainage system's effectiveness[1][9].

Despite these measures, the Fens remain vulnerable to flooding due to their low-lying nature, with about a third of the area currently below sea level[3]. The ongoing challenge is to balance the needs of agriculture, urban development, and environmental conservation while managing flood risks in the face of climate change and rising sea levels.
