The production location of the De Havilland Canada DHC-8 (Dash 8) series has changed over time and is currently in transition:

1. Historical production: The Dash 8 aircraft were originally manufactured at the De Havilland Canada facility in Downsview, Toronto, Ontario. This site had been used for aircraft production since 1929[4].

2. Recent production: The Downsview facility continued to be the primary manufacturing site for the Dash 8 series, particularly the Q400 variant, until recently. Production at this site officially ended in the summer of 2022 when De Havilland Canada's lease on the property expired[4][10].

3. Current status: As of 2023, Dash 8 production is currently paused. De Havilland Canada announced a production halt in February 2021 due to a lack of orders, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic[10].

4. Future plans: De Havilland Canada has announced plans to restart Dash 8 production at a new facility called De Havilland Field, located in Wheatland County, Alberta, approximately 30 minutes east of Calgary[1][2][5]. This new site is expected to include:

   - A state-of-the-art aircraft assembly facility
   - A runway
   - Parts manufacturing and distribution centers
   - A maintenance, repair, and overhaul center
   - Educational space for workforce training
   - A De Havilland Canada aircraft museum

5. Timeline: The company anticipates that the first buildings at De Havilland Field will become operational by 2025[1]. However, full Dash 8 production at this new site is not expected to restart until around 2033[10].

6. Interim activities: While preparing for the restart of full production, De Havilland Canada is focusing on enhancing the Dash 8 platform through various initiatives such as cargo conversion upgrades, cabin enhancements, avionics upgrades, and a life extension program[8].

In summary, while Dash 8 production is currently paused, De Havilland Canada is working towards restarting production at its new De Havilland Field facility in Alberta in the coming years[1][2][5][10].
