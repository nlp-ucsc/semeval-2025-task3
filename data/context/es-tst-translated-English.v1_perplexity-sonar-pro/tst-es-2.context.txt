Fortescue, Missouri is a small village with a population of approximately 20-21 inhabitants as of the most recent data[2][4][5]. However, there are some discrepancies in the reported population figures across different sources:

1. The 2020 census recorded a population of 21 people in Fortescue[5][8].

2. More recent projections for 2024 and 2025 estimate the population to remain stable at 20 residents[2][4].

3. Some sources report slightly higher numbers, with one indicating a population of 35 in an unspecified year[1], and another showing 41 residents in 2022[7].

It's important to note that for such a small community, even minor changes in population can result in significant percentage fluctuations. The village has experienced a declining trend in recent decades:

- In 2010, the population was 32[5][8].
- By 2020, it had decreased to 21, representing a 34.4% decline over that decade[8].

The median age of Fortescue residents varies across sources, with figures ranging from 16.3 years[1] to 48.5 years[2][4]. This discrepancy could be due to different survey years or methodologies.

Fortescue is characterized by its small size, with a land area of only 0.08 square miles (0.20 kmÂ²)[5]. Despite its small population, the village has a relatively high population density compared to the state average, with one source reporting 454 people per square mile[1].

Given the small population and varying data, it's best to consider the most recent official census figure of 21 inhabitants (2020) as the most reliable count, with the understanding that the current population is likely around 20-21 people.
