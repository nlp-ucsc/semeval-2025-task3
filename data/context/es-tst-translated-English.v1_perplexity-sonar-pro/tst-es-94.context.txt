Some plants, particularly certain legumes, produce canavanine for several important reasons:

1. Chemical defense: Canavanine serves as a highly effective protective allelochemical, providing a formidable chemical barrier against predation and disease[1][3]. Its toxicity helps defend the plant against herbivores and pathogens.

2. Nitrogen storage: Many canavanine-producing legumes store large amounts of this compound in their seeds. For example:

   - Members of the genus Canavalia typically allocate 3-4% of their seed dry matter to canavanine storage[3].
   - The neotropical legume Dioclea megacarpa dedicates over 95% of its free amino acid nitrogen to canavanine production[3].
   - Some species like Colutea arborescens and Robinia pseudoacacia store 6-13% canavanine by dry weight[3].

3. Nitrogen mobilization: Plants can effectively mobilize the stored nitrogen from canavanine through enzymatic processes. Arginase converts canavanine to canaline and urea, while urease further breaks down urea into ammonia, which can be used for various metabolic processes[2][3].

4. Metabolic precursor: The carbon skeleton of canavanine can be catabolized for energy-yielding respiratory reactions and used to produce primary metabolites. Its nitrogen is assimilated into various important plant compounds[2].

5. Structural mimicry: Canavanine's effectiveness as a protective compound stems from its structural similarity to arginine. This mimicry allows it to be incorporated into proteins in place of arginine, resulting in dysfunctional proteins in organisms that consume it[1][4].

6. Insecticidal properties: When broken down, canavanine produces canaline, which is a potent insecticide[4]. This adds another layer of defense against insect predation.

The production of canavanine represents an evolutionary strategy that allows these plants to efficiently store nitrogen while simultaneously creating a powerful defense mechanism. This dual-purpose compound helps explain why some legumes invest so much of their resources into producing a single secondary metabolite[3].
