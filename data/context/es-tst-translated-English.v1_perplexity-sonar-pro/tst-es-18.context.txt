Adolf Galland participated in three major conflicts during his military career:

1. Spanish Civil War (1936-1939)
Galland volunteered for the Condor Legion, a unit of the German Luftwaffe that supported the Nationalist forces in Spain[1][4]. He arrived in Spain in May 1937 as a member of Staffel Jagdgruppe 88 and flew He 51 aircraft, primarily performing ground attack missions[1]. During this conflict, Galland flew approximately 300 missions and gained valuable combat experience[1][4].

2. World War II (1939-1945)
Galland was heavily involved throughout World War II, participating in several major campaigns:

a) Invasion of Poland (1939): He flew 50 ground attack missions with 4.(S)/Lehrgeschwader 2, piloting Hs 123 biplanes[1][4].

b) Battle of France (1940): After transferring to the fighter arm, Galland scored his first aerial victories, achieving 14 kills by the end of the campaign[1][4].

c) Battle of Britain (1940): Galland played a significant role, scoring numerous victories against RAF fighters. By the end of 1940, his kill count had reached 58[1][5].

d) Defense of the Reich (1941-1945): As General der Jagdflieger (General of Fighter Pilots), Galland was responsible for the defense of German airspace against Allied bombing raids[6].

Throughout World War II, Galland flew a total of 705 combat missions and was credited with 104 aerial victories, all against Western Allied aircraft[2][3]. He survived being shot down four times and rose to the rank of Lieutenant General[7].

3. Post-War Service in Argentina (1948-1955)
While not a war per se, Galland worked for the Argentinian Air Force between 1948 and 1955, likely contributing his expertise gained from previous conflicts[1][3].

Galland's participation in these conflicts, particularly World War II, established him as one of the most prominent fighter pilots and air commanders of his era.
