The emerging church movement differs from traditional evangelical movements in several key ways:

1. Approach to doctrine and truth:
Emerging churches tend to be more flexible and open-ended in their approach to doctrine, emphasizing mystery and ambiguity[7]. They often reject absolute truth claims and favor ongoing dialogue about theological issues[6]. In contrast, evangelical movements typically hold more firmly to defined doctrinal positions and emphasize the authority of Scripture[4].

2. Worship style and methodology:
Emerging churches often utilize more experiential, creative, and contextual forms of worship that may incorporate elements like candles, art, poetry, and multimedia[2][9]. Evangelical churches generally have more traditional worship formats, though contemporary styles are also common.

3. Cultural engagement:
The emerging movement places a strong emphasis on engaging postmodern culture and connecting with those outside the church[2]. They tend to be more accommodating of secular cultural trends. Evangelical movements also seek cultural engagement but are often more cautious about adopting secular influences.

4. Social issues:
Many emerging churches emphasize social justice, environmentalism, and inclusivity[1][8]. While evangelical churches also engage in social causes, they typically place more focus on personal salvation and traditional moral stances.

5. Church structure:
Emerging churches often favor more decentralized, egalitarian, and participatory structures[1]. Evangelical churches usually maintain more defined leadership roles and organizational structures.

6. View of Scripture:
Some segments of the emerging movement take a less literal approach to biblical interpretation and may question traditional understandings[4][7]. Evangelical movements generally hold to a high view of biblical authority and more literal interpretations.

7. Salvation and evangelism:
Emerging churches may have a broader, more inclusive view of salvation and focus more on living out faith through relationships and social action[9]. Evangelical movements typically emphasize personal conversion and more direct forms of evangelism.

It's important to note that there is significant diversity within both the emerging church movement and evangelical Christianity, so these distinctions are not universal[3][6]. Additionally, some emerging churches maintain more evangelical theological positions while adopting emerging methodologies[3].
