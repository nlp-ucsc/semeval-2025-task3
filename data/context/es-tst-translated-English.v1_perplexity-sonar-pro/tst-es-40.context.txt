The director of the first science fiction film "A Trip to the Moon" (French: "Le Voyage dans la Lune") was Georges Méliès[1][4][6]. Méliès was a pioneering French filmmaker who wrote, directed, produced, and starred in this groundbreaking 1902 silent film[1][7].

Georges Méliès was a former stage magician who became one of the first people to recognize the narrative potential of film[1]. He was extensively involved in all aspects of his films, including directing, producing, writing, designing, editing, and often acting, making him one of the earliest cinematic auteurs[1].

"A Trip to the Moon" is considered a landmark in early cinema and is widely regarded as the first science fiction film[4][6]. The film tells the story of a group of astronomers who travel to the Moon in a cannon-propelled capsule, explore its surface, encounter lunar inhabitants called Selenites, and return to Earth[1].

Méliès used innovative special effects techniques for the time, including stop-motion photography, multiple exposures, and painted sets[3][7]. The film's most iconic image - the spacecraft landing in the eye of the Man in the Moon - remains one of the most recognizable and frequently referenced shots in cinema history[1].

At 14 minutes long, "A Trip to the Moon" was considered an epic for its time, when most films were only a minute or less in duration[6]. Méliès' work laid the foundation for narrative filmmaking and special effects in cinema, influencing generations of filmmakers to come[9][10].
