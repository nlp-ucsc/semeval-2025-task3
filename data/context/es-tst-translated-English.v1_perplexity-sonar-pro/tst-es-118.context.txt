Daniel Ricciardo won the Formula 1 Chinese Grand Prix in 2018[1][2][3]. Driving for Red Bull Racing, Ricciardo produced a masterful performance to take his sixth Formula 1 victory[3].

Some key details about Ricciardo's win:

1. He started the race from 6th position on the grid[2][3].

2. A well-timed pit stop during a safety car period gave Ricciardo fresh soft tires for the final stint of the race[3].

3. With 21 laps to go, Ricciardo was in 6th place but on newer tires than the cars ahead[3].

4. He then made a series of impressive overtakes, passing Lewis Hamilton, Sebastian Vettel, and finally Valtteri Bottas to take the lead with 11 laps remaining[3].

5. Ricciardo crossed the finish line 8.894 seconds ahead of second-placed Valtteri Bottas[2][4].

The podium was completed by:
1. Daniel Ricciardo (Red Bull Racing-TAG Heuer)
2. Valtteri Bottas (Mercedes)
3. Kimi Räikkönen (Ferrari)[1][2]

This victory was particularly impressive given that Ricciardo had nearly missed qualifying due to an engine change, only making it out on track with minutes to spare in Q1[3]. His win showcased both Red Bull's strategic acumen and Ricciardo's overtaking skills, cementing his reputation as one of the best overtakers in Formula 1[3][5].
