Based on the search results provided, there is no specific information about which TV channel broadcasted "The Leftovers" in Spain. However, I can provide some relevant details about the show's availability:

"The Leftovers" was originally an HBO series in the United States[5][6]. In terms of its international distribution, the search results don't mention a specific Spanish TV channel that aired the show.

However, the series is currently available for streaming in various countries:

1. In the United States, "The Leftovers" is available for streaming on Max (formerly HBO Max) and the Max Amazon Channel[3].

2. The show can be purchased for download on Amazon Video[3].

3. While not specifically mentioning Spain, JustWatch indicates that the series is available with Spanish audio on some streaming platforms[3].

It's worth noting that streaming availability can change over time and vary by country. Without more recent or Spain-specific information, it's difficult to say definitively which channel or platform currently offers "The Leftovers" in Spain. To get the most up-to-date information, Spanish viewers would need to check their local TV listings or popular streaming platforms in their country.
