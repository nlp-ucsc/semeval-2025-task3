Mutoscopes were popular from the mid-1890s through the early 20th century, with their peak popularity occurring between 1895 and the 1920s. Here's a more detailed timeline of the Mutoscope's popularity:

1895: The first Mutoscope was produced and patented by Herman Casler[1][2]. It quickly began to replace Edison's earlier Kinetoscope due to its larger images and more durable design[2][4].

1897-1907: This period is considered the "classic age" of the Mutoscope[2]. By 1897, Mutoscopes dominated arcade parlors[4]. During this decade, over 4,000 titles and 100,000 reels were produced and distributed[2][4].

Early 1900s: Mutoscopes were a common feature in amusement arcades and pleasure piers, particularly in the UK[3].

1920s: The Mutoscope was licensed to William Rabkin, who started the International Mutoscope Reel Company. This company manufactured new reels and machines from 1926 until 1949, extending the Mutoscope's popularity[3].

1950s: Production of Mutoscope reels ceased completely in this decade[4]. However, some machines and reels continued to operate commercially even after this time[1][4].

1971: In the UK, the introduction of decimal coinage led to a significant decline in Mutoscope usage, as the coin mechanisms were difficult to convert[3].

It's worth noting that while the popularity of Mutoscopes for general entertainment declined with the rise of projected motion pictures in the early 1900s, they continued to be used in arcades and amusement areas for decades afterward, often featuring "girlie" reels or other risqu√© content[3][6]. Some original machines from the early period were still in operation commercially well into the late 20th century, demonstrating their durability and lasting appeal[4].
