Garajonay National Park is located in the center and north of the island of La Gomera, one of the Canary Islands in Spain[1][2]. The Canary Islands are an archipelago situated off the northwest coast of Africa in the Atlantic Ocean, approximately 400 km west of the African mainland[5].

Some key details about the park's location:

1. Island: La Gomera, which has a total area of about 37,800 hectares[5].

2. Size: The park covers an area of approximately 40 square kilometers (15 square miles), which is about 11% of La Gomera's total land area[1][5].

3. Altitude: The park encompasses a small plateau with an altitude ranging from 790 to 1,400 meters (2,590 to 4,590 feet) above sea level[1].

4. Highest point: The park is named after the rock formation of Garajonay, which is the highest point on the island at 1,487 meters (4,879 feet)[1].

5. Municipalities: The park extends into each of the six municipalities on the island[1].

6. Geographical coordinates: It is situated between 28째05' to 28째12' North latitude and 17째10' to 17째18' West longitude[5].

7. Proximity to other islands: La Gomera is located about 30 km west of Tenerife, another island in the Canary archipelago[5].

The park's central location on La Gomera makes it accessible from various parts of the island, with the Visitor Center located in La Palmita, Agulo, about 3 km from the park's boundary[4]. This unique geographical setting, combined with the influence of trade winds and Atlantic mists, creates the perfect conditions for the park's distinctive laurel forest ecosystem[1][2].
