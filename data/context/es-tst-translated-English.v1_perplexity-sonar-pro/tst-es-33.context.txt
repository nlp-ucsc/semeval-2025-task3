China developed the JL-2 ballistic missile[1][2]. The JL-2 (Chinese: 巨浪-2; pinyin: Jù Làng Èr; lit. 'Giant Wave 2') is a Chinese second-generation intercontinental-range submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) deployed on the People's Liberation Army Navy's (PLAN) Type 094 submarines[1]. It is a naval variant of China's land-based DF-31 missile[2].

Some key details about the JL-2:

- It provides China with its first viable sea-based nuclear deterrent[1].
- Development began in the 1970s, with the first at-sea launch occurring in 2001[1].
- It entered service around 2015[2].
- The missile has a range of 7,200-9,000 km[1][2].
- It can carry a single 1 megaton nuclear warhead or 3-8 smaller MIRV warheads[1][2].
- As of 2017, China had deployed 48 JL-2 launchers on its submarines[1].

The JL-2 represents a significant advancement in China's naval nuclear capabilities, allowing its submarines to potentially strike targets in the continental United States, though its limited range would require the submarines to sail farther from China's shores to do so[3].
