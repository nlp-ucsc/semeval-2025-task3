The first generation of the Aston Martin Vanquish was produced from 2001 to 2007[1][2]. This generation was introduced as a successor to the Aston Martin Virage and was designed by Ian Callum[2]. It debuted at the 2001 Geneva Motor Show and became the flagship model for Aston Martin during its production run[1].

The first-generation Vanquish had two main variants:

1. V12 Vanquish (2001-2004): This was the initial model, featuring a 5.9L V12 engine producing 460 hp[1][3].

2. V12 Vanquish S (2004-2007): Introduced as a more powerful version, with engine output increased to 520 hp[1][2].

The Vanquish was notable for being the last model to be hand-built at Aston Martin's Newport Pagnell factory, with production ending on July 19, 2007, coinciding with the closure of this historic facility[1][2]. In total, 2,578 units of the first-generation Vanquish were produced, with 1,492 being the original Vanquish and 1,086 being the Vanquish S model[2].
