The Autonomous Province of Korçë existed from 1916 to 1920[1][4][5]. 

On December 10, 1916, fourteen Albanian delegates, including seven Muslims and seven Christians, proclaimed the Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë under the military protection of the French army[1]. This autonomous entity was established after French forces occupied the area during World War I.

The autonomous province was created as a result of negotiations between local Albanian leaders and French military authorities. It was led by Themistokli Gërmenji as president and operated under French protection[1]. 

During its existence, the Autonomous Province of Korçë developed several state-like characteristics:

1. It had its own flag and stamps[7].
2. It issued its own currency called Francs, with the first banknotes being put into circulation on March 1, 1917[7].
3. It had internal self-government represented by an Albanian council, alongside French military authorities[7].
4. It maintained its own gendarmerie and court system[7].

The French pursued policies that strengthened Albanian nationalism in the region, including closing Greek schools (though they were reopened in February 1918) and promoting Albanian education and self-government[1][4].

The autonomous status of Korçë came to an end in 1920 when the city was officially awarded to Albania by the International Boundary Commission, following the four-year French occupation[3]. This decision affirmed Albania's 1913 borders and integrated Korçë fully into the Albanian state.
