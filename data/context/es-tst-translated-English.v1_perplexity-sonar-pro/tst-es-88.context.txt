Choe Ryong-hae does not have direct familial ties to Kim Jong-un, the current leader of North Korea. However, Choe is closely connected to the Kim family through political and marital relationships:

1. Political connections:
Choe Ryong-hae is a high-ranking official in North Korea's government and Workers' Party of Korea (WPK). He holds several important positions, including Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly and First Vice President of the State Affairs Commission[1][4]. He is considered the third top-ranking official in North Korea after Kim Jong-un and premier Kim Tok-hun[1][4].

2. Family background:
Choe comes from a privileged background. His father, Choe Hyon, fought alongside Kim Il-sung (Kim Jong-un's grandfather) in the anti-Japanese guerrilla movement and later served as North Korea's defense minister[4]. This connection to the country's founding generation has contributed to Choe Ryong-hae's political prominence.

3. Marital alliance:
While not directly related to Kim Jong-un, Choe Ryong-hae's family is connected to the Kim family through marriage. Choe's second son, Choe Song, is reportedly married to Kim Yo-jong, Kim Jong-un's younger sister[2][4]. This marital alliance strengthens the ties between the Choe and Kim families.

4. Role in Kim Jong-un's leadership:
Choe played a significant role in securing Kim Jong-un's leadership after Kim Jong-il's death in 2011[4]. He has been seen as a key asset in consolidating Kim Jong-un's power and has received important promotions since Kim Jong-un took office.

In summary, while Choe Ryong-hae is not a blood relative of Kim Jong-un, he is closely connected to the Kim family through political ties, a shared revolutionary heritage, and a marital alliance. These connections have contributed to his prominent position in North Korea's leadership structure.
