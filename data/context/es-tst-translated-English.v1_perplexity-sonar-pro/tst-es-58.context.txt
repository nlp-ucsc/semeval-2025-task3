The asteroid (661) Cloelia was discovered by American astronomer Joel Hastings Metcalf on February 22, 1908[1][5]. 

Joel Hastings Metcalf (1866-1925) was not only an astronomer but also a Unitarian minister and humanitarian[5]. He graduated from Harvard Divinity School in 1892 and served as a minister in various locations including Burlington, Vermont, Taunton, Massachusetts, Winchester, Massachusetts, and Portland, Maine[5].

Metcalf was a prolific asteroid discoverer, credited with discovering or co-discovering 41 asteroids between 1905 and 1914[5]. Some of his other notable asteroid discoveries include:

- 525 Adelaide (discovered October 21, 1908)
- 581 Tauntonia (discovered December 24, 1905)
- 660 Crescentia (discovered January 8, 1908)
- 662 Newtonia (discovered March 30, 1908)

In addition to asteroids, Metcalf also discovered or co-discovered several comets, including 23P/Brorsen-Metcalf and 97P/Metcalf-Brewington[5].

Cloelia, like many of Metcalf's discoveries, is a main-belt asteroid. It orbits the Sun in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter[1]. The asteroid is named after Cloelia, a legendary figure from Ancient Roman history[1].
