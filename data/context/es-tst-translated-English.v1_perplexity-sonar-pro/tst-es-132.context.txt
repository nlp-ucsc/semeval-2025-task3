The second album by the American band Blondie is called "Plastic Letters"[1][5]. This album was released in February 1978, just seven months before their breakthrough album "Parallel Lines"[5]. 

Some key details about "Plastic Letters":

1. It was produced by Richard Gottehrer, who also produced their debut album[5].

2. The album featured the hit single "Denis", which reached #2 in the UK charts and #1 in Europe, although it did not perform as well in the US[5][3].

3. Other notable tracks on the album include "Kidnapper" and "Contact in Red Square"[5].

4. The album cover features Debbie Harry wearing a pink dress designed by Anya Phillips[7].

5. While not as commercially successful as their later work, "Plastic Letters" helped establish Blondie's presence in the UK and European markets[3].

6. It was released on Chrysalis Records, which had bought out the band's contract with Private Stock Records[10].

"Plastic Letters" represented a step forward for Blondie in terms of their songwriting and sound, paving the way for their massive success with "Parallel Lines" later that same year.
