The official colors of Fredrikstad FK's first kit are red and white[1]. Specifically:

- The home shirt is red
- The shorts are white 
- The socks are white

This red and white color scheme has been Fredrikstad FK's traditional home kit colors for many years. The club adopted these colors in 1926 after being inspired by the Polish national team's kit when Fredrikstad played a friendly match against Poland[1].
