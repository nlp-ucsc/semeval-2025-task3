The Western Athens Peripheral Unit, also known as the Regional Unit of West Athens, consists of 7 municipalities[1][2]. These municipalities are:

1. Agia Varvara
2. Agioi Anargyroi-Kamatero
3. Aigaleo
4. Chaidari
5. Ilion
6. Peristeri
7. Petroupoli

This regional unit was created as part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, which restructured the administrative divisions throughout Greece[1][2]. It covers the west-central part of the Athens agglomeration and is part of the larger Attica region[1].

The Regional Unit of West Athens encompasses a total area of 66.7 square kilometers and has a population of 478,883 inhabitants[2]. It's connected to central Athens through an extensive network of public transportation and major arterial roads. The area is geographically defined by natural boundaries such as Mount Egaleo and Mount Poikilo, which create distinct sectors among the seven municipalities[2].

Each of these municipalities maintains community centers where residents can participate in local governance and organize traditional Greek celebrations, contributing to the area's cultural and administrative landscape[2].
