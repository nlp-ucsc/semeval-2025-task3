No, the population of Mileto in Calabria is not increasing. According to the available data, Mileto's population has been steadily declining over the past few decades[1][4].

Here's a detailed breakdown of Mileto's population trends:

1. Historical trend:
   - 1981 Census: 7,357 inhabitants
   - 1991 Census: 7,492 inhabitants
   - 2001 Census: 7,157 inhabitants
   - 2011 Census: 6,894 inhabitants[1]

2. Recent estimates:
   - 2022 Evaluation: 6,415 inhabitants
   - 2024 Evaluation: 6,275 inhabitants[1]

This data shows a clear downward trend in Mileto's population, with a decrease of about 15% from its peak in 1991 to the most recent estimate in 2024.

The declining population in Mileto is consistent with broader demographic trends in Calabria:

1. Regional context: Calabria as a whole has experienced population decline since the 1990s. After some fluctuations between 1990 and 1994, the region's population started to decrease continuously, albeit at a slow pace[3].

2. Factors contributing to population decline:
   - Aging population: Like much of Italy, Calabria has seen a shift towards older age groups[3].
   - Migration: The negative population development in Calabria has been influenced by net migration, with a relatively high share of emigration compared to other Italian regions[3].

3. Birth and death rates: While Calabria historically had high birth rates, they have dropped sharply since the 1990s. By 2001, the birth rate in Calabria (9.2 per thousand) was equal to the Italian average[3].

It's worth noting that Mileto's population decline is not an isolated case but part of a broader demographic trend affecting many rural and smaller urban areas in Calabria and southern Italy. Factors such as economic challenges, lack of job opportunities, and the attraction of larger cities or other regions contribute to this ongoing population decrease.
