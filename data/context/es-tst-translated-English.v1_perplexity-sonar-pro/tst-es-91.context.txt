Monterchi is located in the region of Tuscany in Italy[1][2][4]. Specifically, Monterchi is a comune (municipality) in the Province of Arezzo in Tuscany[1][3]. It is situated about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southeast of Florence, the capital of Tuscany, and approximately 20 kilometers (12 miles) east of the city of Arezzo[1][3].

Monterchi sits in the northern part of the Valtiberina (Tiber Valley), where the Tiber river flows from Emilia-Romagna towards Rome[1]. This valley runs through Romagna, Tuscany, and Umbria, parallel to the Casentino Valley[1]. 

The town is positioned near the border between Tuscany and Umbria[2][8], which allows it to enjoy influences from both regions. Interestingly, from 1927 to 1939, Monterchi was briefly part of Umbria due to a shift in regional borders, but it returned to Tuscany following protests by the local population[4].

Monterchi is known for its rich cultural heritage, particularly for housing the famous fresco "Madonna del Parto" by Renaissance master Piero della Francesca[2][4][5]. This artwork, now preserved in the Museo della Madonna del Parto, attracts art enthusiasts from around the world to this small Tuscan town[5].
