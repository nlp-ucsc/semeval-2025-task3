The first Women's World Taekwondo Championship was held in 1987[1]. This marked a significant milestone in the history of taekwondo as a competitive sport for women at the international level.

Prior to 1987, the World Taekwondo Championships had been primarily focused on men's competitions. The inclusion of women's events in 1987 represented an important step towards gender equality in the sport. From that year onwards, both men's and women's championships have been held concurrently as part of the World Taekwondo Championships[1].

The introduction of women's competitions coincided with a period of rapid growth and internationalization for taekwondo. In the 1980s, taekwondo was gaining recognition from major international sporting bodies:

- In 1980, the World Taekwondo Federation (now known as World Taekwondo) became an IOC-recognized sports federation[3].
- In 1981, taekwondo was included in the World Games[3].
- In 1984, it was admitted to the Asian Games as an official event[3].
- In 1986, taekwondo became part of the Pan-American Games[3].

The inclusion of women's events in the World Championships was thus part of a broader trend of taekwondo's expansion and development as a global sport. Since 1987, women's taekwondo has continued to grow, with female athletes competing at the highest levels, including the Olympic Games, where taekwondo has been an official medal sport since 2000[7].
