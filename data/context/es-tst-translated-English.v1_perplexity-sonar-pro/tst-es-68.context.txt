Pythagoras's spouse was named Theano. She was an ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician in her own right, living in the 6th century BC[1][2].

Theano made significant contributions to mathematics, philosophy, and science:

1. Mathematics and Philosophy: 
   - She is credited with developing Pythagorean theories related to the existence of natural numbers in all things and the ability to numerically express the magnitude of any element of nature[2].
   - Theano is said to have worked on the theorems of the Golden Mean and the Golden Rectangle, which are considered her most important contributions[10].

2. Teaching:
   - She taught astronomy and mathematics at the schools of Pythagoras in Croton[2].
   - After Pythagoras's death, Theano reportedly ran the dispersed Pythagorean School with the assistance of two of her daughters[9].

3. Writing:
   - Theano is credited with writing treatises on mathematics, physics, medicine, and child psychology[9].
   - Some writings attributed to her include "Pythagorean Apophthegms," "Female Advice," "On Virtue," "On Piety," "On Pythagoras," "Philosophical Commentaries," and "Letters"[10]. However, the authenticity of these works is debated among modern scholars.

4. Medicine:
   - Theano and her daughters acquired reputations as excellent physicians[9].
   - They reportedly prevailed in a debate with the physician Euryphon on the nature of fetal development, arguing that the fetus is viable after the seventh month[9].

It's worth noting that there is some uncertainty and debate among historians about the details of Theano's life and work. Some sources suggest there may have been more than one Theano, sometimes referred to as Theano I and Theano II[10]. Despite these uncertainties, Theano is recognized as an important figure in early Greek mathematics and philosophy, particularly within the Pythagorean tradition.
