The two Rhodesias corresponded to the following current countries:

1. Northern Rhodesia: This territory became the independent country of Zambia on October 24, 1964[1][4].

2. Southern Rhodesia: This territory eventually became the modern-day country of Zimbabwe[2][7].

To provide more context:

Northern Rhodesia was a British protectorate from 1911 until its independence in 1964[4]. It was formed by amalgamating two earlier protectorates: Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia and North-Eastern Rhodesia[4]. The territory was initially administered by the British South Africa Company on behalf of the British Government, and from 1924 onwards, it was administered directly by the British Government as a protectorate[4].

Southern Rhodesia, on the other hand, had a different status. It was a self-governing British colony from 1923[2]. In 1965, it unilaterally declared independence from the United Kingdom, becoming known simply as Rhodesia[2]. This unilateral declaration was not recognized internationally[5]. After a period of conflict and negotiations, the country finally gained internationally recognized independence in 1980 as Zimbabwe[2].

It's worth noting that between 1953 and 1963, both Northern and Southern Rhodesia, along with Nyasaland (now Malawi), were part of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, also known as the Central African Federation[3]. This federation dissolved in 1963, shortly before Northern Rhodesia became Zambia and Nyasaland became Malawi[3].
