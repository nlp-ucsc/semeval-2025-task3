The Shonen Jump edition of the NES Classic (officially called the Nintendo Classic Mini: Family Computer Weekly Shonen Jump 50th Anniversary Commemoration Version) differs from the standard NES Classic Edition in several key ways:

1. Appearance: The Shonen Jump edition features a gold-colored Famicom-style casing, contrasting with the gray NES Classic or red-and-white Famicom Classic[1][6].

2. Game Selection: While the standard NES Classic includes 30 classic Nintendo games, the Shonen Jump edition contains 20 games specifically tied to manga series that appeared in Weekly Shonen Jump magazine over its 50-year history[1][7].

3. Exclusive Content: The game lineup includes titles based on popular manga like Dragon Ball, Dragon Quest, and Fist of the North Star, which are not available on the standard NES Classic[1].

4. Limited Availability: This special edition was released exclusively in Japan in 2018 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Weekly Shonen Jump magazine[6][7].

5. Interface: While the basic interface is similar to the standard NES Classic, the Shonen Jump edition features a slightly different design scheme reflecting its association with Weekly Shonen Jump. It also includes a unique idle sequence that imitates the opening scene from the Famicom Jump video game[10].

6. Audio: Instead of a single background tune on the main menu, the Shonen Jump edition plays randomized music from the included games[10].

7. Packaging: The system comes in a box designed to evoke the appearance of Weekly Shonen Jump magazine[3].

These differences make the Shonen Jump edition a unique collector's item, especially for fans of manga and anime, as it celebrates the history of one of Japan's most influential manga publications through the medium of classic video games.
