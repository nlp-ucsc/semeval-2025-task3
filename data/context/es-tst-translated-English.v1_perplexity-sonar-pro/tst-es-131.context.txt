The construction of Steinway Tower, also known as 111 West 57th Street, took approximately 8 years from groundbreaking to completion. Here are the key details:

Construction on the Steinway Tower began in early 2014[3]. The project faced some challenges along the way, including a pause in construction in 2017 due to financing issues[2]. Despite these setbacks, work continued and the building reached several important milestones:

- In April 2019, the building's concrete superstructure topped out, reaching its full height[1].
- By October 2019, the building was officially topped out with its architectural elements in place[3].
- In March 2021, the exterior hoist was dismantled, signaling the completion of major exterior work[1].
- The building was opened to residents in April 2022[4][2].

So from the start of construction in early 2014 to welcoming its first residents in April 2022, the total time for building the Steinway Tower was approximately 8 years and 3 months. This timeline reflects the complexity of constructing such a unique and slender supertall skyscraper in the heart of New York City.

It's worth noting that the planning and development process for the tower began even earlier. The initial plans for a residential skyscraper on this site date back to 2005, and the current developers acquired the lots between 2012 and 2013[6]. However, the actual construction period lasted from 2014 to 2022.
