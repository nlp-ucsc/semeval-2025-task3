Guillaume Budé lived in the 15th and 16th centuries. He was born on January 26, 1467 in Paris, France, and died on August 20, 1540, also in Paris[1][2]. 

Budé's life spanned a crucial period in European history, coinciding with the height of the Renaissance. He was born in the latter half of the 15th century, during a time when Renaissance ideas were spreading from Italy to other parts of Europe, including France[1]. His adult life and scholarly career took place primarily in the first four decades of the 16th century.

During his lifetime, Budé became one of the most influential French humanist scholars of the early 16th century[7]. He played a significant role in promoting classical studies in France and contributed to the intellectual climate that characterized the French Renaissance[2]. His work and influence extended from the late 15th century through the first half of the 16th century, making him a pivotal figure bridging these two centuries in the context of Renaissance scholarship and humanism.
