Real Madrid Castilla, as the reserve team of Real Madrid, does not have its own separate president. The president of Real Madrid oversees all aspects of the club, including the reserve team Castilla[5].

Currently, Florentino Pérez serves as the president of Real Madrid, and by extension, he is also responsible for Real Madrid Castilla[3]. Pérez has been re-elected as president of Real Madrid until 2029, marking his seventh presidential term and fifth consecutive term[8].

While Real Madrid Castilla doesn't have its own president, it does have its own management structure:

1. The team has a head coach, currently Raúl González[5].

2. In 2006, Francisco Moreno Cariñena became the first independent chairman of Castilla in 16 years, indicating some level of separate management for the reserve team[5].

3. The president of Real Madrid, Florentino Pérez, is known to be involved with Castilla. For example, he has visited the team before important matches, such as their promotion playoff in 2023[9].

It's worth noting that as a reserve team, Castilla's primary purpose is to develop players for the main Real Madrid squad. Therefore, its management is closely tied to the overall club structure rather than operating as a completely separate entity with its own presidency.
