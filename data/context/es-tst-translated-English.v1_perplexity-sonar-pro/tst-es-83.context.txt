The last royal yacht of the British Crown was Her Majesty's Yacht (HMY) Britannia[1][2]. This famous ship served the British Royal Family for over 44 years, from 1954 to 1997[4]. Here are some key details about HMY Britannia:

1. Commissioning and Service:
- HMY Britannia was commissioned on January 11, 1954[2].
- She was the 83rd royal yacht since King Charles II acceded to the throne in 1660[2].
- During her career, Britannia traveled more than a million nautical miles, visiting over 600 ports in 135 countries[2].

2. Construction and Design:
- Built by John Brown & Co. Ltd in Clydebank, Scotland[2].
- Launched by Queen Elizabeth II on April 16, 1953[2].
- Designed with three masts and could be converted into a hospital ship in wartime (though this capability was never used)[2].

3. Royal Use:
- Served as a floating royal residence and played a key role in major historic events[4].
- Hosted state receptions and banquets for world leaders[4].
- Provided the Royal Family with rare privacy away from public duties[4].

4. Decommissioning:
- In 1994, the Conservative government announced the yacht's retirement due to high maintenance costs[3].
- Britannia was officially decommissioned on December 11, 1997[2].
- The decommissioning ceremony was an emotional event for the Royal Family, particularly Queen Elizabeth II[6].

5. Current Status:
- Now permanently berthed at Ocean Terminal, Leith in Edinburgh, Scotland[2].
- Serves as a visitor attraction, receiving over 300,000 visits each year[2].
- Maintained by the Royal Yacht Britannia Trust[2].

HMY Britannia's retirement marked the end of a long tradition of royal yachts in Britain. Despite occasional proposals, no successor has been built to replace Britannia as the royal yacht[2].
