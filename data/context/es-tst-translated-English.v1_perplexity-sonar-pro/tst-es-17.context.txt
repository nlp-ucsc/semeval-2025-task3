One of the main causes of type 2 diabetes is obesity or being overweight[1][2][5]. Excess body fat, especially when concentrated around the abdomen, increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes significantly. This is because:

1. Having more fatty tissue makes cells more resistant to insulin[5]. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels by allowing glucose to enter cells. When cells become resistant to insulin, glucose builds up in the bloodstream instead of being used for energy.

2. Fat distribution plays a role. Storing fat mainly in the abdominal area, rather than in the hips and thighs, indicates a greater risk for type 2 diabetes[4]. Men with a waist circumference above 40 inches and women with a waist measurement above 35 inches are at higher risk.

3. Being overweight or obese is often associated with a sedentary lifestyle, which further increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes[1][2]. Physical inactivity reduces the body's ability to use insulin effectively.

4. Excess weight can lead to prediabetes, a condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be classified as diabetes[5]. If left untreated, prediabetes often progresses to type 2 diabetes.

It's important to note that while obesity is a significant risk factor, it's not the only cause of type 2 diabetes. Other factors such as genetics, age, and ethnicity also play a role[1][2]. However, maintaining a healthy weight through proper diet and regular physical activity can significantly reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes or help manage the condition if already diagnosed.
