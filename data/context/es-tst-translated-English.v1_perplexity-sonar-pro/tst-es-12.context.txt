John Swinney joined the Scottish National Party (SNP) in 1979 at the age of 15[1][2]. His decision to join the party was motivated by his anger at the way Scotland had been portrayed by television commentators during the Commonwealth Games[1]. This early political involvement marked the beginning of Swinney's long career in Scottish politics, which has spanned over four decades.

Swinney's commitment to the SNP was evident from a young age. He quickly became a prominent figure in the party's youth wing, then known as the Young Scottish Nationalist (now called Young Scots for Independence)[1]. His rapid rise within the party ranks saw him take on significant responsibilities at a relatively young age:

1. He served as the SNP's Assistant National Secretary in his early 20s[1].
2. At the age of 22, in 1986, he became the National Secretary of the SNP[1][5].

This early start in politics laid the foundation for Swinney's future leadership roles within the party and in Scottish government. His long-standing membership and dedication to the SNP have been key factors in his political career, which has included:

- Serving as an MP for Tayside North from 1997 to 2001[1]
- Being elected as an MSP in 1999, initially for North Tayside and later for Perthshire North[1][5]
- Leading the SNP from 2000 to 2004[1]
- Holding various cabinet positions in the Scottish Government since 2007[1]
- Becoming Deputy First Minister in 2014[1]
- Being elected as SNP leader and First Minister of Scotland in 2024[1][2]

Swinney's early joining of the SNP at 15 and his subsequent rise through the party ranks demonstrate his long-standing commitment to Scottish nationalism and his significant role in shaping the party's direction over the past four decades.
