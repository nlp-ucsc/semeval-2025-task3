The asteroid (5757) Tichá orbits around the Sun[5][7]. It is classified as a main belt asteroid, which means it is located in the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter[6][8]. 

Some key details about (5757) Tichá's orbit:

1. It has an orbital period of 1,838.0559372 days, which is equivalent to about 5.03 years[5][7].

2. As a main belt asteroid, its orbit is generally not very elongated and lies within the region between Mars and Jupiter[8].

3. The asteroid was discovered on May 6, 1967[5][7].

4. Like other asteroids, it revolves around the Sun in an elliptical orbit while also rotating on its axis[8].

5. Its orbit classifies it as part of the main asteroid belt population, rather than other asteroid groups like near-Earth asteroids or trojan asteroids[8].

The fact that (5757) Tichá orbits the Sun is consistent with the definition of asteroids as small rocky bodies that orbit the Sun, leftover from the formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago[8].
