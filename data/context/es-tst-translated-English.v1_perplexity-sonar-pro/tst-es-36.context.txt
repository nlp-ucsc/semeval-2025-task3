The Cuban men's national volleyball team has won one Olympic medal in their history[1][5]. Specifically:

- They won a bronze medal at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal[1][5].

This bronze medal represents Cuba's best performance in men's volleyball at the Olympic Games. Some additional context about their Olympic history:

1. Cuba first appeared in Olympic volleyball in 1972, finishing 10th[1][5].

2. After their bronze medal in 1976, their next best finish was 4th place in 1992[1][5].

3. Cuba qualified but withdrew from the 1984 and 1988 Olympics due to boycotts[1][5].

4. Their most recent Olympic appearance was in 2016, where they finished 11th[1][5].

5. Cuba has not qualified for the men's volleyball tournament in the last two Olympics (2020 Tokyo and 2024 Paris)[1][5].

It's worth noting that while the men's team has only one Olympic medal, the Cuban women's volleyball team has been more successful, winning three consecutive gold medals in 1992, 1996, and 2000[7].
