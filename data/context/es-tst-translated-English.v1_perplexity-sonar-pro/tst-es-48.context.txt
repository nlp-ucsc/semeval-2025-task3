An oval and an ovoid are related geometric shapes, but they have distinct characteristics:

Oval:
An oval is a two-dimensional, closed curve that resembles the outline of an egg or a flattened circle[3][7]. Key features of an oval include:

1. It is a 2D shape with no straight lines or vertices[3].
2. It has one flat, curved face[3].
3. It may have one line of symmetry, though this is not always the case[3][5].
4. The term "oval" is broad and can refer to various elongated, closed curves that are not circular[5].

Ovoid:
An ovoid is the three-dimensional equivalent of an oval[3][5][7]. Characteristics of an ovoid include:

1. It is a 3D shape that is egg-like in form[1][4].
2. It can be described as the surface generated by rotating an oval curve around one of its axes of symmetry[7].
3. In mathematical terms, it's often defined as a convex, smooth surface that forms the boundary of a bounded region in 3D space[1].

Key differences:
1. Dimensionality: The primary distinction is that an oval is a 2D shape, while an ovoid is a 3D shape[3][5][7].

2. Real-world examples: 
   - Oval: The outline of an egg on paper, a racetrack, or the shape of some mirrors[3].
   - Ovoid: A whole egg, certain fruits, or some sculpture forms[1][4].

3. Mathematical precision: While "oval" is often used informally to describe egg-like shapes, "ovoid" has more specific mathematical definitions in certain contexts, such as in projective geometry[2].

4. Symmetry: Ovals may or may not have symmetry, whereas ovoids typically have at least one axis of symmetry due to their three-dimensional nature[1][5].

In summary, an oval is a 2D shape that resembles a flattened or elongated circle, while an ovoid is the 3D, egg-shaped equivalent of an oval. The ovoid can be thought of as the result of giving an oval depth or volume in three-dimensional space.
