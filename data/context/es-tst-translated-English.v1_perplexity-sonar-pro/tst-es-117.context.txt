Rothbach is located in the Grand Est region of France, specifically in the Bas-Rhin department in the northeastern part of the country[2][3]. 

The Grand Est region, formerly known as Alsace-Champagne-Ardenne-Lorraine, is one of the 18 administrative regions of France. It was created in 2016 through the merger of three former regions: Alsace, Champagne-Ardenne, and Lorraine.

Rothbach is situated approximately 39 kilometers from Strasbourg, which is the capital of the Bas-Rhin department and also serves as the official seat of the European Parliament[3]. This places Rothbach in the historical and cultural region of Alsace, known for its unique blend of French and German influences due to its location along the Franco-German border.

The commune of Rothbach is part of the Arrondissement of Haguenau-Wissembourg, which is an administrative subdivision of the Bas-Rhin department[8]. This area is characterized by its picturesque landscapes, including forests and rolling hills, typical of the northern Vosges mountains.

For those interested in visiting or learning more about Rothbach, it's worth noting that the village is approximately 379 kilometers from Paris, making it a considerable distance from the French capital but still accessible for those wishing to explore this charming corner of northeastern France[3].
