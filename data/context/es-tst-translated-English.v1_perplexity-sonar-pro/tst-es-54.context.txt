Sergei Parajanov directed the acclaimed film "Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors" (also known as "Tini zabutykh predkiv" in Ukrainian) in 1964[1][2][5]. This film marked a significant turning point in Parajanov's career and is considered his first major work that diverged from the Soviet-mandated socialist realism style[2][10].

"Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors" is a Ukrainian masterpiece adapted from Mikhaylo Kotsyubinsky's 1912 novel of the same name[1]. The film tells a Romeo and Juliet-like tale set in a remote Carpathian village, focusing on Ukrainian Hutsul culture[4][9]. It features a passionate and inventive visual style, characterized by stunning cinematography, vibrant colors, and a celebration of Ukrainian folk traditions[1][4].

Key aspects of the film include:

1. Innovative cinematography by Yuri Ilyenko, featuring fluid, often spinning and dizzying camera work[1][3].
2. A rich portrayal of Carpathian folklore, customs, and traditions[4].
3. Starring Ivan Mikolajchuk as Ivan and Larisa Kadochnikova as Marichka, the ill-fated lovers[1].

The film received widespread international acclaim, winning numerous awards at film festivals around the world, including:

- Grand Prix at the 1965 Mar del Plata International Film Festival[1]
- Awards in London, New York, San Francisco, and Montreal[4]

"Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors" not only launched Parajanov's international reputation but also helped introduce the concept of a 'Soviet new wave' in cinema[7]. Its success and artistic innovation, however, also led to increased scrutiny from Soviet authorities, eventually contributing to Parajanov's political troubles and imprisonment in later years[2][4].
