Hylarana elberti is a species of frog belonging to the true frog family Ranidae[1][7]. Specifically, it is classified as follows:

- Kingdom: Animalia
- Phylum: Chordata  
- Class: Amphibia
- Order: Anura
- Family: Ranidae
- Genus: Hylarana (or Papurana)
- Species: Hylarana elberti

Some key points about this frog species:

1. It is native to Indonesia and Timor-Leste, found on the islands of Timor and Wetar[10].

2. The species was named in honor of Johannes Elbert, a German naturalist who participated in an expedition to the Lesser Sunda Islands and Sulawesi in 1910[10].

3. It has been given the common name "Lesser Sundas frog"[10].

4. The taxonomic classification of this species has undergone some changes. While originally placed in the genus Hylarana, some sources now classify it under the genus Papurana[7][10]. However, this placement is considered provisional pending further morphological and molecular data[10].

5. Hylarana elberti is part of a group of frogs that likely used the Lesser Sunda Islands as a stepping stone for colonization of the Sahul Shelf (which includes Australia and New Guinea)[6].

6. The species may actually comprise multiple distinct species. Populations on different islands (Sumba, Timor, and Wetar) may be genetically distinct enough to be considered separate species[6].

While detailed physical descriptions are not provided in the given search results, as a member of the Hylarana genus, it likely shares some characteristics with other species in this group, such as being small to medium-sized frogs with visible tympanums (ear drums) and webbed toes[5].
