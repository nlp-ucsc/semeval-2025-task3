The genus Abrus consists of herbaceous flowering plants in the pea family (Fabaceae). Here are the key characteristics of plants in the Abrus genus:

1. Growth habit: Abrus plants are typically perennial, climbing vines or lianas[1][2]. They have a twining growth habit, allowing them to climb over trees and shrubs[2].

2. Leaves: The leaves are pinnately compound and alternate on the stem. They usually have 5-15 pairs of small, oblong leaflets[2][3].

3. Flowers: Abrus plants produce small flowers that are typically white to violet-pink in color. The flowers grow in clusters in the leaf axils[2].

4. Seeds: The most distinctive feature of Abrus plants is their seeds. The seeds are typically bright red with a black spot, resembling ladybugs. These seeds are known for their uniform size and weight, which led to their historical use as weights for measuring gold[1].

5. Toxicity: Many Abrus species, particularly Abrus precatorius (rosary pea), are known for their highly toxic seeds. The seeds contain abrin, a potent toxin that can be fatal if ingested[1][2].

6. Distribution: Abrus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Old World, particularly Asia and Australia. Some species, like Abrus precatorius, have become invasive in other tropical areas worldwide[1][3].

7. Uses: Despite their toxicity, some Abrus species have been used in traditional medicine and for ornamental purposes. The colorful seeds are sometimes used in jewelry-making, though this practice can be hazardous due to their toxicity[1].

8. Invasiveness: Some Abrus species, particularly Abrus precatorius, are considered invasive in many tropical and subtropical regions. They can rapidly spread and outcompete native vegetation[2][3].

The genus Abrus contains about 13-18 species[6], with Abrus precatorius being the most well-known and widely distributed. These plants are notable for their ecological impact as invasive species in some regions, their toxicity, and their historical uses in traditional practices.
