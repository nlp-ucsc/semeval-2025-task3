The name of the plants in the genus Agastache derives from two Ancient Greek words:

1. ἄγαν (ágan), meaning "very much" or "a lot of"
2. στάχυς (stákhus), meaning "ear of grain" or "ear of wheat"

These two words combined describe the appearance of the flower spikes characteristic of plants in this genus[1][4][5]. The name Agastache thus refers to the abundant or numerous flower spikes that resemble ears of grain or wheat[6][7]. This etymology reflects the distinctive feature of these plants, which typically have upright spikes of densely packed flowers at the tips of their stems[1][2].
