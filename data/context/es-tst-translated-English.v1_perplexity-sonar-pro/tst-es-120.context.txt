The Pontifical Gregorian University was founded by Saint Ignatius of Loyola in 1551[1][3][4]. Ignatius, who was the founder of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), established the institution initially as a "School of Grammar, Humanities, and Christian Doctrine" in Rome[1][4]. 

The university was originally called the Roman College (Collegio Romano)[1][3]. It received financial support from St. Francis Borgia, who was the viceroy of Catalonia at the time[1]. Ignatius envisioned it as a "university of the nations, for the defense and propagation of the faith and for the training of wise and qualified leaders of the Church and society"[3].

While Ignatius is considered the founder, it's worth noting that Pope Gregory XIII played a significant role in the university's development. In 1584, he provided a new home for the rapidly growing institution and significantly expanded it[1][3]. As a result, the university was renamed in his honor, becoming known as the Gregorian University[3]. 

Today, the Pontifical Gregorian University continues to serve as a major center of ecclesiastical studies, carrying on the legacy of its Jesuit founder, St. Ignatius of Loyola[6][7].
