The alliance between Sparta, Athens, and Ptolemy II of Egypt was created in 269/268 BC by the Athenian statesman Chremonides[1][7]. This alliance was formed as part of a coalition against Antigonid Macedonian domination in Greece.

Specifically:

1. In 269 BC, the Athenian politician Chremonides forged an alliance with Sparta[1].

2. In 269/8 BC (the archonship of Peithidemos), Athens formally entered into an alliance with Sparta, as evidenced by an inscription detailing the treaty[7].

3. This alliance also included Ptolemy II of Egypt, who was already an ally of both Athens and Sparta. The treaty mentions "king Ptolemaios" as being in alliance with both cities[7].

4. Other Greek states were also part of this broader coalition, including Elis, Achaea, Tegea, Mantinea, Orchomenus, Phigalia, Kaphyae, and some Cretan cities[7].

The formation of this alliance led to the outbreak of the Chremonidean War in late 268 BC, when Chremonides declared war on Antigonus II of Macedon[1]. This conflict, which lasted until 261 BC, was an attempt by this coalition of Greek states and Ptolemaic Egypt to challenge Macedonian control over Greece.
