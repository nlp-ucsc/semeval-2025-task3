Nimravidae is an extinct family of carnivorous mammals that lived from the Middle Eocene to the Late Miocene, approximately 40.4 to 7.2 million years ago[1]. Often referred to as "false saber-toothed cats," nimravids were not true cats but rather a separate family within the suborder Feliformia[1].

Key characteristics of nimravids include:

1. Morphology: Nimravids had muscular, low-slung, cat-like bodies with shorter legs and tails compared to modern cats. They walked in a plantigrade or semiplantigrade posture, meaning they walked on the flat of their feet rather than on their toes like modern cats[1].

2. Skull structure: Unlike modern cats, nimravids had a shorter braincase and differences in the structure of their auditory bulla (the bony capsule enclosing parts of the middle and inner ear)[1][2].

3. Dentition: Many nimravids evolved saber-like canine teeth, similar to the more famous saber-toothed cats. However, nimravid canines were often more conical and shorter than those of true saber-toothed cats[1][5].

4. Size range: Nimravids varied in size from as small as a bobcat to as large as modern lions and tigers[1].

5. Diversity: The family included various genera such as Hoplophoneus, Nimravus, Dinictis, and Eusmilus, each with distinct characteristics[1][6].

6. Geographic distribution: Fossils of nimravids have been found in North America, Europe, and Asia[1][3].

7. Ecological role: Nimravids were hypercarnivorous, meaning their diet consisted almost entirely of meat. They were likely ambush predators, similar to modern big cats[2].

8. Evolutionary significance: Nimravids represent an early example of convergent evolution, developing saber-tooth morphology independently from the later true saber-toothed cats[1][5].

9. Extinction: The last nimravids disappeared around 7.2 million years ago, likely due to changes in climate and ecosystems[1].

Recent research has provided new insights into nimravid evolution and diversity. For example, a 2021 study suggested that nimravids developed a wider range of feline-like morphologies than previously thought, not just saber-toothed forms[1]. Additionally, the discovery of early nimravids like Pangurban egiae in California has shed light on their early evolution and dispersal across continents[3].

The study of nimravids continues to be important for understanding the evolution of carnivorous mammals and the repeated emergence of saber-toothed morphology in different lineages.
