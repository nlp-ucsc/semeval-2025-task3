Pierre Dukan was not expelled from the French medical association, but rather voluntarily removed himself from the medical register in 2012. Here are the key details:

In May 2012, Pierre Dukan requested to be removed from the membership of the Ordre des Médecins (French Medical Association)[4]. This action was taken voluntarily by Dukan himself, rather than being an expulsion by the association.

The reasons behind this decision were related to ongoing controversies and criticisms of his diet methods:

1. In March 2012, the French Ordre des médecins had asserted that Dukan violated the organization's medical code of practice by practicing medicine as a business[4].

2. Dukan was facing disciplinary action over his controversial proposal to award extra marks to schoolchildren for staying slim or losing weight[8].

3. He claimed that the disciplinary proceedings were null and void as he had already effectively retired from being a medical practitioner in 2008[9].

It's worth noting that while Dukan removed himself from the medical register in 2012, he faced further sanctions later:

- In July 2013, he received a week-long ban from practicing medicine and was ordered to pay €6,000 in legal costs for prescribing an amphetamine-derivative drug (Mediator) to a patient for weight loss[1].

- In January 2014, Dukan was officially struck off the medical register for promoting his diet commercially[4].

These events highlight the controversial nature of Dukan's career and the scrutiny his methods faced from the medical community.
