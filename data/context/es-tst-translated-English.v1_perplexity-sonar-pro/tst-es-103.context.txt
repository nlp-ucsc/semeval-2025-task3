Đặng Thị Ngọc Thịnh became Vietnam's first woman president in 2018[1][4][6]. She was appointed as acting president on September 23, 2018, following the death of President Trần Đại Quang[1][4]. 

Some key points about Đặng Thị Ngọc Thịnh's appointment and background:

1. She was 59 years old at the time of her appointment[1].

2. Prior to becoming acting president, she had served as vice president since January 2016[1][4].

3. She holds a master's degree in politics and has a background as a jurist[1].

4. Her appointment made her the first female head of state in a communist country since Soong Ching-ling of China[4].

5. She served as acting president until the election and swearing-in of Nguyễn Phú Trọng on October 23, 2018[4].

It's important to note that while Đặng Thị Ngọc Thịnh's appointment was historically significant, some activists and observers pointed out that it may not necessarily lead to substantial improvements in women's rights or conditions in Vietnam[5]. The appointment was seen as symbolically important but limited in its wider significance due to the nature of Vietnam's political system[5].
