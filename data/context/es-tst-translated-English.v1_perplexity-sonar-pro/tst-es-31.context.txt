Amyema is a genus of semi-parasitic shrubs commonly known as mistletoes[2][7]. These plants are aerial stem-parasites that belong to the family Loranthaceae[3][4]. 

Key characteristics of Amyema include:

1. Parasitic nature: They are hemiparasites, meaning they derive some nutrients from their host plants while also performing photosynthesis[1][4].

2. Growth habit: Amyema species grow as shrubs attached to the branches of host trees[4].

3. Distribution: The genus is primarily found in Malesia (including Southeast Asian islands) and Australia[2][7].

4. Species diversity: Amyema comprises approximately 90-100 species, with around 35 native to Australia[1][7][8].

5. Leaf arrangement: Leaves are typically opposite or whorled, rarely scattered, with pennate or curved longitudinal venation[4].

6. Flowers: They usually have red or yellow flowers[7]. The flowers are hermaphrodite and generally 4- to 6-merous[1].

7. Dispersal: Seeds are often spread by birds[7].

8. Host specificity: Some species show high host specificity, sometimes even mimicking their host plants, while others are less specific[1].

9. Habitat: Amyema species can be found in various environments, from closed humid forests to arid woodlands[1].

10. Attachment: They attach to their hosts through haustoria, which can be simple or complex, sometimes with extensive epicortical runners[1][4].

Amyema plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species while also influencing the growth and health of their host plants[1][5][6].
