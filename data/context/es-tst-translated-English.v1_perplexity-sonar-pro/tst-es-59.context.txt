Bahram I was the fourth Sasanian king of Persia, ruling from 271 to 274 CE. Here are the key details about his life and reign:

## Background and Ascension

- Bahram I was the eldest son of Shapur I, the powerful second Sasanian emperor[1][4].
- During his father's reign, Bahram served as the governor of Gilan province, holding the title "Gelan Shah" (King of Gilan)[3].
- Though the eldest son, Bahram was initially passed over for succession in favor of his brother Hormizd I[4].
- After Hormizd I's short one-year reign, Bahram ascended to the throne in 271 CE, likely with support from the influential Zoroastrian priest Kartir[3][4].

## Reign and Policies

- Bahram I's short 3-year reign was relatively uneventful in terms of military campaigns or territorial expansion[2].
- His most significant act was reversing the religious tolerance policy of his father Shapur I[4]. Specifically:
  - He ordered the arrest and execution of Mani, the founder of Manichaeism, in 274 CE[1][3].
  - This began a period of persecution against Manichaeans, Christians, and Buddhists in the Sasanian Empire[2].
  - Bahram I empowered the Zoroastrian clergy, especially the priest Kartir, to establish Zoroastrianism as the state religion[4].

## Characteristics and Representation

- Bahram I was described as fond of fighting, hunting, and feasting[4].
- His coins depict him wearing a distinctive crown adorned with ray-shaped spikes, associated with the deity Mithra[4].
- A rock relief at Bishapur shows Bahram I on horseback receiving the royal diadem from the god Ohrmazd, symbolizing his divine right to rule[4].

## Legacy and Succession

- Bahram I died in September 274 CE after a brief 3-year reign[3].
- He was succeeded by his son, Bahram II[3].
- While praised in some Sasanian-based sources as a benevolent ruler, his reign is generally seen as unremarkable compared to his father Shapur I[4].
- His main historical significance lies in his reversal of religious tolerance and empowerment of the Zoroastrian clergy, which had long-lasting effects on Sasanian religious policy.

Bahram I's reign, though short, marked a significant shift in Sasanian religious policy that would influence the empire's trajectory in subsequent decades.
