Nick Hodgson left Kaiser Chiefs on December 4, 2012[2][3][9]. He announced his departure from the band via Twitter on that date, stating he was leaving to concentrate on other projects[2]. Hodgson had been a founding member of Kaiser Chiefs, serving as their drummer and main backing vocalist from the band's formation in 2003 until his departure in 2012[2].

The split appears to have been amicable, with Hodgson insisting he had no hard feelings towards his former bandmates[10]. In interviews after leaving, Hodgson explained that his decision was motivated by his love for studio work and songwriting, as well as a reduced interest in the demanding touring schedule of Kaiser Chiefs[1]. He stated: "It was obvious really, because they know I love the studio and I love writing and I'm not mad about touring. I loved touring at some point, but I didn't love it all the time and I didn't love it as much as everyone else."[2]

After Hodgson's departure, Kaiser Chiefs continued on with a new drummer, Vijay Mistry, who joined the band in February 2013[4]. Meanwhile, Hodgson focused on songwriting and production work for other artists before eventually launching a solo career in 2018 with his album "Tell Your Friends"[2]. More recently, in 2024, Hodgson formed a new band called "Everyone Says Hi" with members from other 2000s indie bands[1][2].
