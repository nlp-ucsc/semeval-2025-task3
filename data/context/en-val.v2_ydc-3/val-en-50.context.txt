Ponzone is a comune (municipality) in the Province of Alessandria in the Italian region Piedmont, located about 80 kilometres (50 mi) southeast of Turin and about 40 kilometres (25 mi) southwest of Alessandria. As of 31 December 2004, it had a population of 1,217 and an area of 69.3 square kilometres (26.8 sq mi). Ponzone borders the following municipalities: Cartosio, Cassinelle, Cavatore, Grognardo, Malvicino, Molare, Morbello, Pareto, Sassello, Tiglieto, and Urbe.

During the two decades of fascism, Ponza and nearby Ventotene served as a prison for political opponents of Benito Mussolini's regime. The Ethiopian Prince Regent and military leader, Ras Immiru, who was captured by the Italian Army in 1936, was imprisoned in a house in Santa Maria. Today, the island is a tourist attraction with sandy beaches like Chiaia di Luna (Half Moon Beach), now permanently closed due to falling rocks from the huge collapsing cliff above. Several tourists were killed a few years ago while sunbathing on the beach. The Italian National Park Service has installed steel cable netting to prevent further rock falls and deaths. The four mines at the northern end — the most beautiful area of the island — were closed down in 1975 by the Italian Environmental Protection Agency because the mining operation was destroying the wildlife and flora, which are endangered species. The mines produced kaolin and Bentonite. Many of the original inhabitants of Ponza are now leaving the island. They are steadily being replaced by other Italians from the mainland.
