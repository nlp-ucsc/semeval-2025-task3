Neptune also experimented with a new HTML and Win32-based user interface originally intended for Windows Me, called Activity Centers, for task-centered operations. Only one alpha build of Neptune, 5111, was released to testers under a non-disclosure agreement, and later made its way to various beta collectors' sites and virtual museums in 2000. In early 2000, Microsoft merged the team working on Neptune with that developing Odyssey, the successor to Windows 2000 for business customers. The combined team worked on a new project codenamed Whistler, which was released at the end of 2001 as Windows XP. In the meantime, Microsoft released Windows Me in 2000 as their final 9x series installment. Triton was devised back in 1998 alongside Neptune; the only details of it within Microsoft's internal planning documentation that year relates to a deadline for added hardware support by December 2001. According to Paul Thurrott, the timeline of releases was Windows NT 5.0 (the codename for Windows 2000) for high-end workstations and Windows 98 for entry-level and mid-range PCs from 1998 to 1999; followed by Neptune in 2000 and 2001 for both workstations and consumer PCs; followed by Triton for the same target audience. The project's codename refers to Neptune's largest moon, Triton. The touch-oriented Metro design language introduced as part of Windows 8, released in 2012, shared a large number of common goals with the Neptune project, including the unimplemented Activity Centers' focus on typography as well as dedicated full-screen applications for common tasks. Neptune was the codename for a version of Microsoft Windows under development in 1999. Based on Windows 2000, it was originally to replace the Windows 9x series and was scheduled to be the first home consumer-oriented version of Windows built on Windows NT code.

Microsoft Neptune is an unreleased version of the Windows operating system that had originally been in testing by Microsoft to succeed Windows 2000, but for home users. The project was combined with Windows Odyssey as Windows Whistler, which was released as Windows XP in 2001. However, Neptune's NT-based kernel had been in testing with a higher version number (5.5) than Windows XP (5.1). In early 2000, Microsoft merged the team working on Neptune with that developing Windows Odyssey, the upgrade to Windows 2000 for business customers. The combined team worked on a new project codenamed Whistler, which was released at the end of 2001 as Windows XP.

It is unknown what these editions would actually become, if Neptune was ever released. There are also several strings in file USETUP.EXE from Neptune build 5111.1 that clearly mention "Neptune Server". These references could be leftovers from Windows 2000, if all "2000" strings were simply replaced with "Neptune" during the rebranding process. NOTE: Only Build 5.5.5111.1 was ever leaked, the rest of the builds were mentioned in file versions in various Windows Me builds and Builds 5.5.5118.1, 5.5.5119.1, and 5.5.5120.1 were mentioned in early Windows XP builds. ... Neptune, Odyssey, and... Microsoft Windows "Neptune" (internally at Microsoft also known as NepTune) was planned to become the successor of the Windows 2000 family as well as the first consumer version of Windows under the NT kernel. It was under development in 1999, until it was canceled, along with Odyssey to give way for Whistler, which would be released as Windows XP in 2001. As stated in confidential Microsoft documents, Neptune was to be released in Q1 2000, planned to have 64-bit edition (referred to as "NT64") for the upcoming Intel Itanium processor, "Solar Coaster" (Unix Services for NT), Internet Explorer 6 (which was also in development at the time) and some Anti-Piracy features. There is evidence that five service packs were planned for Neptune.
