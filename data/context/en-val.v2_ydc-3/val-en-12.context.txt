On 17 April 2024, Salzburg qualified for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the United States following Arsenal's elimination from the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League. In 2009, Red Bull bought an amateur club in Leipzig, Germany and renamed them RasenBallsport Leipzig (so named to circumvent local rules on corporate naming) with the aim of establishing a leading branded team in that country in a similar mould to its existing franchises in Salzburg and other locations. The club was known as SV Austria Salzburg, and had several sponsored names, before being bought by Red Bull GmbH in 2005 who renamed the club and changed its colours from its traditional violet and white to red and white. The change resulted in some of the team's fans forming a new club, SV Austria Salzburg. Despite drawing both matches with Ajax, Salzburg picked up a solitary 3–1 win away in Athens and were eliminated in third place. The club moved to its current stadium in 2003. The Red Bull company headed by Dietrich Mateschitz purchased the Salzburg Sport AG on 6 April 2005. The club's bylaws were amended so that the Red Bull Salzburg GmbH has the sole right to appoint and recall board members of the club. After the takeover, Mateschitz changed the club's name, management, and staff, declaring "this is a new club with no history".

September 2019 After such a long wait, the first ever UEFA Champions League match was held at the Red Bull Arena as FC Salzburg faced KRC Genk. Our Salzburg side were in incredible form, brushing the Belgian champions aside with a sensational 6-2 win. It was a truly memorable Champions League night. June 2018 From the 2018/19 season, the Upper Tier of the Red Bull Arena was opened only to season-ticker holders at Austrian Bundesliga and cup matches. That reduced the capacity at Austrian matches to 17,218, ensuring for a more compact and better atmosphere. The full stadium can still be opened for European matches. 8 March 2018 New record attendance!
