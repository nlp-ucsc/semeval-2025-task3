Count Carl Axel Löwenhielm (3 November 1772 – 9 June 1861) was a Swedish military officer, diplomat, and politician. He was an illegitimate son of King Charles XIII of Sweden and Augusta von Fersen (married to the Chancellor of the Royal Court Fredrik Adolf Löwenhielm) and a half-brother of general and diplomat Gustaf Löwenhielm. He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in 1808, in 1812 to the General Adjuster, in 1814 to Major General and in 1815 to the Lieutenant-General. Löwenhielm was a member of the Swedish cabinet between 1822–1839 and represented Sweden at the Congress of Vienna.

This time the marriage was a happy one, and as Löwenhielm had inherited a large sum of money from his father he retired from diplomatic duties and settles in Värmland on the family estate. He served as County Governor of Gothenburg and Bohus County between 1843 and 1845 and later again served as a military officer. Carl Gustaf Löwenhielm was born in Värmland and grew up in a manor house. He joined the military in 1809 and in 1811 became courtier in the service of the Crown Prince, the future King Oscar I of Sweden. In 1812 he traveled to Russia to join the anti-Napoleonic cause. He fought in the Russian army against the French in the battles of Borodino and Leipzig and was present during the conquest of Paris in 1814. He married on 18 September 1817 Jacquette Löwenhielm, the mistress of King Oscar I of Sweden and Norway. He traveled to Bavaria in 1822 on a mission from Prince Oscar to ask for the hand of Josephine of Leuchtenberg on his behalf. In 1824 he was appointed to the equivalent of Swedish ambassador to the Ottoman Empire and served in Istanbul until 1830. Löwenhielm detested his assignment to Turkey and considered the time there a waste of years. After his years in Turkey, Löwenhielm also worked for some years as a Swedish envoy to the Imperial Court in Vienna. In 1840 Löwenhielm married in Vienna Countess Natalie Alexandra von Buxhoeveden (1814-1867), a granddaughter of Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden.
