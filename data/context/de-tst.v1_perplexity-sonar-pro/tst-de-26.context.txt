I apologize, but I don't have accurate information about Mario Bolatti's transfer in the summer of 2007. The search results provided do not contain relevant information about Mario Bolatti's transfer that year. 

The search results primarily focus on Mario Balotelli, a different player. There is only one brief mention of Mario Bolatti in result [3], which states:

"Im Jahre 2007 stand der kopfballstarke Bolatti kurz vor einem Wechsel zu Juventus Turin. Nachdem der Vereinsvorstand von Belgrano noch meinte, den ..."

This suggests that in 2007, Bolatti was close to a transfer to Juventus Turin, but it doesn't confirm if the transfer actually happened. The information is incomplete and doesn't specify which club he actually joined that summer, if any.

To accurately answer your question about Mario Bolatti's transfer in the summer of 2007, we would need more specific information about his career during that time period.
