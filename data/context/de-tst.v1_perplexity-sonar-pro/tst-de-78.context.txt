Based on the census data provided for Palm River-Clair Mel CDP, Florida, 40.4% of persons age 5 years and over speak a language other than English at home[1]. While this statistic doesn't specifically isolate Spanish speakers, it gives us a good indication of the linguistic diversity in the area.

Additionally, the data shows that 43.7% of the population identifies as Hispanic or Latino[1]. Although not all Hispanic or Latino individuals necessarily speak Spanish, there is often a strong correlation between Hispanic/Latino identity and Spanish language use.

Given these two data points, we can reasonably infer that a significant portion of the 40.4% who speak a language other than English at home are likely Spanish speakers, especially considering the large Hispanic/Latino population.

It's important to note that the census data doesn't provide an exact percentage of Spanish speakers. However, the combination of these statistics suggests that Spanish is likely the most common non-English language spoken in Palm River-Clair Mel CDP, with a substantial portion of the population speaking it at home.
