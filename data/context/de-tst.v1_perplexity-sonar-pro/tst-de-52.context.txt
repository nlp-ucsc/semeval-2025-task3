John Christopher Willis received several notable honors and recognitions during his career as a botanist:

1. Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS): Willis was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1919[1]. This is one of the most prestigious scientific honors in the United Kingdom, recognizing individuals who have made substantial contributions to the improvement of natural knowledge.

2. Darwin-Wallace Medal: In 1958, Willis was awarded the Darwin-Wallace Medal (Silver) by the Linnean Society[1]. This medal is given to individuals who have made significant contributions to evolutionary biology.

3. Fellow of the Linnean Society: Willis was elected as a Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1897[1]. This society is the world's oldest active biological society and being elected as a fellow is a significant recognition in the field of natural history and biology.

These honors reflect Willis's significant contributions to botany, particularly his work on plant distribution and evolution. His "Age and Area" hypothesis, though controversial, was an important contribution to the field of biogeography. Willis's critical approach to natural selection and his support for alternative evolutionary mechanisms, such as mutation-driven evolution, also made him a notable figure in early 20th-century evolutionary biology[1].
