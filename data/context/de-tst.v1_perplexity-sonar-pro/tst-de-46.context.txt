According to the information provided in the search results, Victoire Tomegah Dogbé moved to Shell in 1992. Specifically, from 1992 to 1994, she was in charge of the firm's network situated in Togo[1][7]. Shell refers to Royal Dutch Shell, the multinational oil and gas company[7].

This move to Shell came after she had started her professional career at Industries Togolaise des Plastiques (ITP) in 1986, where she had worked as chief of staff and then was promoted to head of supply and administrative and financial Director[1]. After her time at Shell, she returned to ITP in 1994 to take over its management until 1998[1].

This transition to Shell represents an important step in Dogbé's early career, showcasing her experience in both the plastics industry and the oil and gas sector before she moved into roles with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and eventually into Togolese politics.
