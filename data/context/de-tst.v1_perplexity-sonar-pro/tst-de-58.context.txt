The CSS-N-14, also known as the JL-2 (Julang-2), is a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) that is based on the land-based DF-31 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM)[1][7].

Key details about the CSS-N-14/JL-2:

1. It is a second-generation SLBM developed by China to succeed the earlier JL-1 missile[7].

2. The JL-2 is deployed on China's Type 094 (Jin-class) nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines[1][7].

3. It provides China with its first viable sea-based nuclear deterrent capability[7].

4. Development of the JL-2 is closely linked to the DF-31 ICBM, as they share a common 2-meter diameter solid fuel rocket motor[7].

5. The missile has an estimated range of about 7,200 km (4,500 miles)[7].

6. It can carry a single 1 Megaton warhead or 3-8 MIRVs (Multiple Independently Targetable Reentry Vehicles) with yields of 20, 90, or 150 kilotons[7].

7. The first successful at-sea launch of the JL-2 occurred in 2001, with further successful tests in 2005, 2008, and 2009[7].

8. As of 2017, 48 JL-2 launchers were reported to be deployed on submarines[7].

The development of the CSS-N-14/JL-2 represents a significant advancement in China's strategic nuclear capabilities, providing a sea-based deterrent that complements its land-based ICBM force.
