I apologize, but I do not have any specific information about a Benedictine monastery called "Saint-Pierre de la Haute-Pierre" or its founding date in the provided search results. The search results do not contain any direct references to a monastery by that exact name.

However, the search results do mention several other monasteries and abbeys dedicated to Saint Peter (Saint-Pierre in French) in different locations:

1. The Abbey of Saint-Pierre de la Couture in Le Mans, France, which was founded by Saint Bertrand, Bishop of Le Mans, between 586 and 616[2].

2. The Abbey of Hautvillers, also known as "Saint Pierre d'Hautvillers," which was founded around 650-662 by Archbishop Nivard of Reims[3].

3. Saint-Pierre de Chaillot in Paris, whose first church dates back to the 11th century[4].

4. Two monasteries named Saint-Pierre in Reims, one of which existed from at least the end of the 6th century until the French Revolution[5].

5. The Abbey of Saint-Pierre in Moissac, which has existed since at least the late 8th century, though legends claim it was founded by King Clovis in the 6th century[7].

6. A Benedictine nunnery in Beaumont, founded at the end of the 7th century, which included the Ã‰glise Saint-Pierre built between 1060 and 1090[9].

Without more specific information about the location or other details of the Saint-Pierre de la Haute-Pierre monastery you're inquiring about, I cannot provide an accurate founding date. If you have any additional information about its location or historical context, that might help in finding more relevant information.
