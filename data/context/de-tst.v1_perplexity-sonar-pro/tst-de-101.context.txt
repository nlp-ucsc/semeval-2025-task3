Oxford University Association Football Club (Oxford University AFC) currently plays in the BUCS Football League, which is the league system for British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS)[1]. 

The BUCS Football League is a competition specifically for university and college teams in the United Kingdom. It's not part of the main English football league system, but rather a separate league structure for higher education institutions.

Oxford University AFC has a long and prestigious history in English football, having been founded in 1872 and even winning the FA Cup in 1874[6]. However, in modern times, the club focuses on competing against other universities rather than professional clubs.

The team plays regular fixtures throughout the academic year against other university teams. The highlight of their season is typically the annual Varsity match against Cambridge University, which is played at a professional stadium[6].

It's worth noting that while Oxford University AFC represents the university in intercollegiate competitions, there is also an extensive college football system within Oxford University itself. This internal league involves over 110 teams and 1500 players, making football the largest participation sport at the university[8].
