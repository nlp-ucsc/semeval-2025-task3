John Christopher Willis was born in Liverpool, England on February 20, 1868[2]. Specifically, some sources indicate he was born in Birkenhead, which is near Liverpool[4]. Birkenhead is a town on the Wirral Peninsula, across the River Mersey from Liverpool. So while Liverpool is often cited as his birthplace, Birkenhead appears to be the more precise location within the greater Liverpool area where Willis was born.
