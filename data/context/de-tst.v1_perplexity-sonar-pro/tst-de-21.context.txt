Bert Olmstead coached two teams during his post-playing career:

1. Vancouver Canucks (Western Hockey League): Olmstead coached the Vancouver Canucks of the Western Hockey League for one season in 1965-66[1][2]. His record with the Canucks was 33 wins, 35 losses, and 4 ties, for a .486 winning percentage[1].

2. Oakland Seals (NHL): In the 1967-68 season, Olmstead was the first head coach of the expansion Oakland Seals in the NHL[1][2][3]. However, he did not complete the full season, stepping down after 64 games. During his tenure with the Seals, the team won only 11 games, resulting in a .297 winning percentage[1].

Olmstead's coaching career was relatively brief and less successful compared to his playing career. He retired from coaching after his stint with the Oakland Seals in 1968.
