I apologize, but I do not have enough information in the provided search results to accurately answer the question about which century the Church of the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary in Joannas, France was built. The search results do not contain any specific information about this particular church or the town of Joannas.

To properly answer this question, we would need additional historical information about the church's construction or architectural details that could help date it. Without access to reliable sources about this specific church, I cannot provide an accurate century for its origin.

If you need information about this church, I would recommend searching for sources specifically related to the history and architecture of Joannas, France, or contacting local historical societies or church authorities in that region for accurate details about the church's founding and construction.
