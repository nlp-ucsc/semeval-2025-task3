Lil Dagover was married twice:

1. Fritz Daghofer: She married actor Fritz Daghofer in 1917[1][2]. Fritz was 25 years older than Lil[1]. They divorced in 1919[1][2][4]. Some sources indicate they may have married earlier, in 1907[3]. During this marriage, they had a daughter named Eva Maria, born in 1909[3][4].

2. Georg Witt: In 1926, Lil Dagover married film producer Georg Witt[1][2][4][6]. This marriage lasted until Witt's death in 1973[1][2], spanning nearly 50 years[3]. Georg Witt produced many of Dagover's future films[4].

It's worth noting that Lil Dagover's birth name was Marie Antonia Siegelinde Martha Seubert[2][4][6]. She adopted the stage name "Dagover" as a variant of her first husband's surname after their marriage[2][4].
