Based on the search results, Pietro Nenni joined the Italian Republican Party (Partito Repubblicano Italiano, PRI) in 1908. 

Specifically:

- Multiple sources confirm that Nenni joined the Italian Republican Party in 1908[2][8][9].

- In 1908, at the age of 17, Nenni began his political career by joining the PRI, which was a left-liberal party at the time[8].

- That same year, Nenni also started his career in journalism, publishing his first articles and becoming the editor of a republican newspaper in Forl√¨[2][8][10].

It's worth noting that Nenni's political affiliations changed later in his life. While he started with the Republican Party in 1908, he eventually became a prominent figure in the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) in the 1920s and remained a key socialist leader for decades[1][2][7]. However, the specific question about his 1908 party affiliation is clearly answered by his joining of the Italian Republican Party that year.
