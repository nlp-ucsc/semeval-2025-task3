Based on the search results, David F. Sandberg produced several short films in 2014:

1. "Pictured" - A short film directed by Sandberg[1][4].

2. "Not So Fast" - Another short film directed by Sandberg, in which he also acted[1][4][10].

3. "Coffer" - A short horror film directed by Sandberg[1][4].

4. "See You Soon" - A short film directed and composed by Sandberg[1][4].

These short films were part of Sandberg's early career as a filmmaker, where he focused on creating no-budget short horror films that he released online under the pseudonym "ponysmasher"[1]. This period was crucial in his development as a filmmaker, as he used these projects to hone his skills in writing, directing, producing, editing, and even composing music for his films.

It's worth noting that 2014 was just before Sandberg's breakthrough with the feature-length adaptation of his short film "Lights Out" in 2016, which launched his career in Hollywood[1][7].
