Quintilian was Rome's first state-appointed professor of rhetoric. He held the position of public professor of Latin rhetoric in Rome, which was established and funded by Emperor Vespasian around 78 CE[1][2][5].

Some key points about Quintilian's professorship:

1. He was the first teacher to receive a state salary for teaching Latin rhetoric in Rome[1][2].

2. This public chair of rhetoric was created by Emperor Vespasian, likely as part of efforts to support education and create an "intelligent and responsible ruling class"[5].

3. Quintilian held this position for about 20 years, from approximately 68-88 CE, spanning the reigns of Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian[1][2][5].

4. As the premier rhetoric teacher in Rome, he taught many prominent students, including Pliny the Younger and possibly Tacitus[5].

5. His role as a state-funded professor allowed him to devote more time to his school and teaching[5].

6. This prestigious position reflected Quintilian's status as Rome's most respected teacher of Latin oratory during this period[1].

So in summary, Quintilian was specifically a professor of rhetoric, with a focus on Latin oratory, in a position that was unprecedented in its official state sponsorship in Rome at that time. This role combined teaching, theory, and the practical application of rhetorical skills.
