James Braid was the primary architect responsible for designing Pennard Golf Club, though several other architects made significant contributions over the years[1][5][7]. Here are the key details about Pennard's design history:

1. Original Design: James Braid designed the original 18-hole course in 1908, during the club's reconstitution year[1]. Braid made three visits to Pennard that year to create the layout.

2. Further Braid Involvement: Braid returned to make additional modifications in 1911, 1920, and 1931[1]. These visits helped shape much of the course that exists today.

3. Other Architects: While Braid deserves the majority of credit, several other notable golf architects contributed to Pennard's evolution:

   - Fred G. Hawtree made alterations in 1920[1].
   - H.S. Colt was paid to make suggestions for changes in 1920, though it's unclear if these were implemented[1].
   - C.K. Cotton made significant contributions in 1965, including extending the first tee[1][7].
   - Donald Steel made alterations in 1991[1].

4. Recent Work: In more recent years, renowned architect Tom Doak has been involved in consulting on bunker renovations and potential course improvements[5][9]. Doak's associate Clyde Johnson has overseen some of the shaping work for these projects.

5. Ongoing Evolution: The course continues to evolve, with recent bunker renovation projects incorporating artificial revetting solutions to address maintenance challenges in the sandy, windswept terrain[5][9].

While James Braid is rightfully credited as the original designer of Pennard Golf Club, it's important to recognize that the course has benefited from the input of multiple skilled architects over its long history, helping to create the highly regarded "Links in the Sky" that exists today.
