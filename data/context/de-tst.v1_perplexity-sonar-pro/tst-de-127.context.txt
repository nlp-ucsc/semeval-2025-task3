Bee Train Production, commonly known as Bee Train, is located in Tokyo, Japan[2][3]. Specifically:

1. The studio was originally founded in Kokubunji, Tokyo in 1997[2].

2. In 2001, it moved to another part of Tokyo[2].

3. In 2006, Bee Train acquired an additional studio location in Kichijōji, Musashino, Tokyo[2].

4. The company also had a studio location in Karuizawa, Nagano Prefecture, which was acquired in 2004[2].

Bee Train was founded by Kōichi Mashimo as a subsidiary of Production I.G in 1997, but became an independent studio in 2006[2]. The studio is known for producing anime series such as Noir, .hack//Sign, and Madlax, among others[2][3]. 

It's worth noting that while the studio was active for many years, producing various anime series and OVAs, it has been dormant since 2012 due to Kōichi Mashimo's retirement from the anime industry[2]. The official website of Bee Train was removed in 2024, indicating that the studio is no longer actively operating[2].
