John Swinney studied politics at the University of Edinburgh. He graduated with a Master of Arts (MA) Honours degree in Politics in 1986[1][3][4]. 

Swinney's education at the University of Edinburgh laid the foundation for his future political career. He joined the Scottish National Party (SNP) at a young age of 15 in 1979, while still in high school[1][4]. After completing his secondary education at Forrester High School in Edinburgh, he went on to pursue his higher education at the University of Edinburgh[1][3][6].

The MA Honours in Politics that Swinney obtained is a prestigious degree that typically involves in-depth study of political systems, theories, and international relations. This educational background undoubtedly prepared him well for his future roles in Scottish politics, including his positions as a Member of Parliament, Member of the Scottish Parliament, and various cabinet roles in the Scottish Government[1][4].

It's worth noting that Swinney's time at the University of Edinburgh coincided with his early involvement in the SNP. His political engagement during his university years likely complemented his academic studies in politics, providing practical experience alongside theoretical knowledge[7].
