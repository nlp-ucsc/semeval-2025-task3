Based on the search results, several species of Fomitiporia have been reported in Europe:

1. Fomitiporia mediterranea (F. mediterranea or Fmed): This is considered the main causal agent of white rot in Esca-diseased grapevines in Europe and Mediterranean climate areas[1][3]. It was originally misidentified as F. punctata before being described as a new species in 2002[1][3].

2. Fomitiporia punctata (F. punctata): This species was previously thought to occur on grapevines, but many of these reports were likely misidentifications of F. mediterranea[1][3]. F. punctata is now considered a boreal species limited to Central and Northern Europe, with its southernmost confirmed occurrence in the Swiss Ticino[2].

3. Fomitiporia robusta[2]

4. Fomitiporia hartigii[2][6]

5. Fomitiporia hippophaeicola[2]

6. Fomitiporia erecta: Reported to occur on grapevine in Spain[1][6]

7. Fomitiporia rhamnoides: A recently described species found growing on Hippophae rhamnoides[9]

The distribution and prevalence of these species vary across Europe:

- F. mediterranea is widespread in Mediterranean and Central European wine-growing regions. It has expanded its range northward in recent decades, possibly due to climate change[1][2][3].

- F. punctata has a more northern distribution, being found in Central and Northern Europe[2][4].

- Other species like F. robusta, F. hartigii, and F. hippophaeicola are also present in Europe, but their exact distributions are not detailed in the provided search results.

It's important to note that the taxonomy and distribution of Fomitiporia species in Europe have been revised in recent years, particularly after the description of F. mediterranea in 2002. Some previous reports of F. punctata on grapevines in Southern Europe were likely misidentifications of F. mediterranea[1][3]. The genus Fomitiporia continues to be studied, with new species being described and distributions being refined through molecular and morphological studies.
