Mar√≠a Grever composed her first piece of music at a remarkably young age. According to multiple sources, she wrote her first musical composition, a Christmas carol, when she was just four years old[1][6]. This early display of musical talent foreshadowed her prolific career as a composer.

However, her first published song came later. At the age of 18, Grever composed "A Una Ola" (To a Wave), which became her first major success[1][3]. This song was not only her first published work but also achieved significant commercial success, reportedly selling three million copies[1][6].

It's worth noting that while Grever began composing at a very young age, her professional career as a composer started to take shape in her late teens and early twenties. Between 1920 and 1925, she was actively writing music, though many manuscripts from this period have unfortunately been lost[8].

Throughout her career, Grever went on to compose hundreds of songs, with estimates ranging from 200 to over 1,000 compositions[6][10]. Her early start in music composition set the stage for a remarkable career that would see her become one of the most prolific and influential Mexican composers of the 20th century.
