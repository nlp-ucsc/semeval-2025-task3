Ch√∂gyam Trungpa's home monastery was Surmang Monastery, specifically Surmang Dutsi Til Monastery, located in the Kham region of eastern Tibet[1][5]. 

Some key details about Trungpa's connection to Surmang Monastery:

1. He was recognized as the 11th incarnation of the Trungpa tulkus, who traditionally headed the Surmang monastery complex[1][2].

2. At a very young age (some sources say 18 months old, others 2 years old), he was enthroned as the supreme abbot of the Surmang monasteries[1][5].

3. He received his early Buddhist education and training at Surmang Monastery before fleeing Tibet in 1959[1].

4. The Surmang monastery complex was Trungpa's seat monastery, meaning it was his primary monastic affiliation and base[5].

5. After Trungpa's death, efforts were made to rebuild and expand Surmang Monastery, including the construction of a shedra (monastic college) that was scheduled to open in 2018[5].

The Surmang monastery complex played a crucial role in Trungpa's early life and spiritual development, serving as the foundation for his later work in bringing Tibetan Buddhism to the West[1][5].
