Based on the search results provided, there is no direct information about whether Germany ever occupied Mercy-le-Haut specifically. However, we can infer some relevant context:

1. Mercy-le-Haut is a commune in northeastern France, located in the Meurthe-et-Moselle department in the Grand Est region. This area was close to the Western Front during World War I and was part of the territory occupied by Germany during World War II.

2. The search results mention Mercy-le-Haut in the context of military operations during World War II:

- The 40th Division was reportedly positioned near Mercy-le-Haut to counter potential enemy movements from Fontoy[7].
- The 18th Division moved via Mercy-le-Haut to Grigy during a deployment[8].
- Company C of the 774th Tank Destroyer Battalion sent guns to the vicinity of several locations, including Mercy-le-Haut, during operations in the Moselle River and Metz area[9].

Given that Mercy-le-Haut is located in northeastern France near the German border, and considering that Germany occupied much of France during World War II, it is highly likely that Mercy-le-Haut was indeed occupied by German forces at some point during the war. However, without more specific historical records, we cannot state this with absolute certainty based solely on the provided search results.

The military activities mentioned in the vicinity of Mercy-le-Haut suggest that the area was contested during the Allied advance into German-occupied territory, likely in late 1944 or early 1945 as Allied forces pushed towards Germany. This further supports the likelihood of prior German occupation, but does not provide definitive proof.
