William S. Burroughs famously referred to John Waters as the "Pope of Trash"[1][3]. This nickname was bestowed upon Waters in 1986 and has since become an iconic moniker associated with the filmmaker[3].

John Waters himself has embraced this title, considering it one of the greatest compliments he's ever received. In an interview, Waters expressed his enthusiasm for the nickname, stating: "Are you kidding? It was the best quote of my life. It was like the pope himself coming down from heaven to give me the Imperial Margarine crown and James Brown's cloak."[1]

This title aptly captures Waters' reputation for creating transgressive, provocative, and often deliberately tasteless films that challenge societal norms. The "Pope of Trash" nickname reflects Waters' status as a revered figure in the world of cult cinema and his ability to elevate lowbrow or taboo subjects to the level of art.

The moniker also highlights the connection between Burroughs and Waters as influential figures in American counterculture. Both artists were known for pushing boundaries and exploring themes that were often considered forbidden or controversial by mainstream society.
