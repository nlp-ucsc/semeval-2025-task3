I apologize, but I don't have accurate information about the average annual snowfall in Altadena, California. The search results provided do not contain any specific data about snow in Altadena. 

Altadena is located in Southern California, which generally has a warm Mediterranean climate. Snowfall is extremely rare in this region, especially at lower elevations like Altadena. 

The search results primarily discuss a recent wildfire called the Eaton Fire that caused significant damage in Altadena in January 2025. Several buildings, including homes, businesses, and community centers were destroyed[1][7][9]. This suggests that Altadena typically experiences hot, dry conditions that can lead to wildfires rather than snowy winters.

If you're looking for information about snowfall in areas that do receive significant snow, I can provide some general data about snow in Finland, which was mentioned in some of the search results:

- In Finland, snow cover typically lasts 4-6 months per year[2].
- The southwestern coast of Finland has snow on the ground for about 3-4 months annually[4].
- Northern and eastern parts of Finland, like Lapland, can have snow for over half the year[4].

However, this information is not applicable to Altadena, California, which has a very different climate from Finland. If you need specific snow data for Altadena, it would be best to consult local weather records or climate databases for Southern California.
