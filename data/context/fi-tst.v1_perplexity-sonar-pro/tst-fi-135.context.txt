The extinction of Isolobodon portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican hutia, is believed to have been caused by a combination of factors following European colonization of the West Indies[1]. Here are the main reasons thought to have contributed to its extinction:

1. Introduction of invasive species:
   - Black rats (Rattus rattus): The early introduction of black rats by European settlers around 1500 is considered a significant threat to the Puerto Rican hutia[1]. These invasive rats likely competed for resources and preyed on the native species.
   - Small Indian mongooses (Urva auropunctata): Introduced in the 19th or early 20th century, these mongooses may have played a role in the final extirpation of the species[1].

2. Human predation:
   - The Puerto Rican hutia was an important food source for the indigenous Ta√≠no people[1].
   - European explorers, including Christopher Columbus and his crew, are believed to have consumed the species upon their arrival[1].

3. Habitat loss:
   While not explicitly mentioned in the search results, it's likely that European colonization led to significant habitat destruction and alteration, further contributing to the species' decline.

4. Inability to adapt:
   The hutia's limited range and potentially specialized habitat requirements may have made it particularly vulnerable to changes in its environment.

It's worth noting that the exact timing of the Puerto Rican hutia's extinction is uncertain. While it's commonly regarded as extinct, some researchers maintain hope that the species might still survive in undisturbed refuges[1]. However, if it did survive beyond the initial European colonization, it likely became extinct sometime in the 19th or early 20th century due to the cumulative effects of these factors.
