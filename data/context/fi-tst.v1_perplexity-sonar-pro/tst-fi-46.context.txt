Peter Iwers has mentioned several notable bassists as his musical influences:

1. Mike Porcaro from Toto[1][3]
2. Geddy Lee from Rush[1][3]
3. John Myung from Dream Theater[1][3]

These influential bassists represent a diverse range of musical styles, from progressive rock to more mainstream rock. Their technical prowess and distinctive playing styles have clearly had an impact on Iwers' approach to bass playing in his melodic death metal career, particularly with bands like In Flames and The Halo Effect.
