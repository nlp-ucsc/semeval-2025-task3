Based on the search results, Ethel Smyth studied privately with two notable composers:

1. Alexander Ewing: Smyth began studying with Ewing when she was 17 years old. He introduced her to the music of Wagner and Berlioz[1].

2. Heinrich von Herzogenberg: After leaving the Leipzig Conservatory, Smyth continued her music studies privately with Herzogenberg[1]. 

It's worth noting that before her private studies, Smyth also studied composition at the Leipzig Conservatory under Carl Reinecke. However, she left after only a year, feeling dissatisfied with the standard of teaching there[1][2]. Her decision to pursue private studies with Herzogenberg came after this brief period at the conservatory.

Through her studies and connections in Leipzig, Smyth also had the opportunity to meet and interact with other prominent composers of her time, including Dvořák, Grieg, Tchaikovsky, Clara Schumann, and Brahms[1][2]. While these interactions were influential, they were not formal teacher-student relationships.
