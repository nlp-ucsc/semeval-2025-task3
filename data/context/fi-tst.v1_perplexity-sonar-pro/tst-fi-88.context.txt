Laurance Rockefeller had four children:

1. Laura R. Chasin
2. Marion R. Weber 
3. Dr. Lucy R. Waletzky
4. Laurance S. "Larry" Rockefeller Jr.[1][3][7]

Laurance Rockefeller married Mary French in 1934, and together they had three daughters and one son[1][4]. At the time of his death in 2004, Rockefeller had eight grandchildren and twelve great-grandchildren[1][3]. His wife Mary passed away in 1997, seven years before his own death[3].

The Rockefeller children grew up in an environment that emphasized values such as frugality, generosity, humility, and hard work[2]. They were taught the importance of financial management from a young age and were required to create projects to earn allowances, instilling in them skills in managing accounts and incorporating philanthropy as a vital aspect of their financial responsibilities[2].
