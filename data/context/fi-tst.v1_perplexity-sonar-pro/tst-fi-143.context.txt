Publius Quinctilius Varus committed suicide in September AD 9 during the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest[1][5][7]. As the Roman forces under his command were being overwhelmed by Germanic tribes led by Arminius, Varus realized the situation was hopeless and chose to take his own life rather than be captured[1][5].

Specifically, Varus fell on his sword, a common method of suicide for Roman military commanders facing defeat[1][3]. This occurred on the third and final day of fighting, as the Germanic forces were delivering the decisive blow to the Roman legions at Kalkriese Hill, north of Osnabr√ºck[1].

After Varus' death, Arminius cut off his head and sent it to King Maroboduus of the Marcomanni tribe in Bohemia, likely as a gesture to try to form an anti-Roman alliance[1][3]. However, Maroboduus declined and instead sent Varus' head to Rome, where Emperor Augustus had it buried in the imperial family mausoleum[3][5].

Varus' suicide was seen as an honorable act by Roman standards, allowing him to avoid capture and potential torture or humiliation at the hands of the enemy[7]. However, it did not spare his reputation, as he was largely blamed for the catastrophic defeat that resulted in the destruction of three entire Roman legions[6].
