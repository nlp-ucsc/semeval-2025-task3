I apologize, but I don't have any specific information about the languages spoken in Dioumaténé. The search results provided do not contain any data about languages in Dioumaténé, which appears to be a location not mentioned in the given information. The search results primarily focus on languages spoken in the United States and globally most spoken languages, but do not include details about Dioumaténé or its linguistic landscape.

To provide an accurate answer about the most common languages in Dioumaténé, we would need more specific information about this location, including its geographical context and demographic data. Without such information, I cannot make any definitive statements about the languages spoken there.

If you have any additional information about Dioumaténé, such as its location or country, it might help in making an educated guess about possible languages spoken there. However, for accurate information, a specific search about Dioumaténé's linguistic situation would be necessary.
