Petra van Staveren, a former competitive swimmer from the Netherlands, won a gold medal in the women's 100-meter breaststroke event at the 1984 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles, United States. This achievement stands out as the pinnacle of her swimming career and a significant moment in Dutch swimming history.

Born on June 2, 1966, in Kampen, Netherlands, van Staveren specialized in breaststroke events throughout her competitive swimming career. Her gold medal performance at the 1984 Olympics was particularly noteworthy for several reasons:

1. Olympic Record: 
Van Staveren not only won the gold medal but also set a new Olympic record in the process. She completed the 100-meter breaststroke in a time of 1:09.88, becoming the first female breaststroker to break the 1:10 barrier at the Olympic Games. This achievement was groundbreaking and set a new standard for female breaststrokers in Olympic competition.

2. Unexpected Victory:
What makes van Staveren's win even more remarkable is that she was not considered a favorite for the event. She arrived at the 1984 Olympics as an outsider for the breaststroke events, which included both the 100 and 200 meters. Despite the lack of expectation, she managed to outperform the pre-meet favorites, showcasing her skill and determination.

3. Race Dynamics:
The gold medal race itself was a display of van Staveren's prowess in the pool. She took an early lead in the race, turning at the halfway point with a half-body length advantage over her competitors. Demonstrating her strength and technique, she maintained control throughout the race, ultimately securing the gold medal. This performance highlighted her ability to execute under pressure on the world's biggest sporting stage.

4. Context of the 1984 Olympics:
The 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles were notable for various reasons, including the participation of athletes from around the world and the numerous records set during the games. Van Staveren's gold medal contributed to the Netherlands' overall medal count and showcased the country's strength in swimming events.

It's worth noting that while van Staveren's performance in the 100-meter breaststroke was exceptional, her Olympic journey had its challenges as well. In the 200-meter breaststroke event, she finished tenth overall in the B-finals, indicating the specificity of her prowess in the shorter distance. Additionally, her team faced disappointment in the 4x100 meters medley relay, where they were disqualified during the preliminaries due to an early takeoff by a teammate.

In conclusion, Petra van Staveren won a gold medal for the women's 100-meter breaststroke at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Her victory was marked by an Olympic record-breaking time of 1:09.88, an unexpected triumph over the favorites, and a dominant performance from start to finish. This achievement not only represents the highlight of van Staveren's swimming career but also stands as a significant moment in the history of Dutch swimming and Olympic breaststroke events.
