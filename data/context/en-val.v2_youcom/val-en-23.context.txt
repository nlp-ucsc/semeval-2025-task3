Based on the comprehensive research conducted, I can provide a detailed analysis of the creation of the municipality of Delley-Portalban, including the exact date of its formation and relevant contextual information.

### Creation Date of Delley-Portalban

The municipality of Delley-Portalban was officially created on January 1, 2005. This date marks the formal merger of two previously separate villages, Delley and Portalban, into a single administrative entity.

### Historical Context of Delley and Portalban

To fully appreciate the significance of this merger, it's important to understand the rich history of both Delley and Portalban as separate entities:

1. **Delley**: This village has deep historical roots, with its first mention in historical records dating back to 1342, where it was referred to as "Deler". The Delley name is associated with a noble family that held considerable influence in the region during the Middle Ages, suggesting a long-standing importance in local governance and society.

2. **Portalban**: This village boasts an even older historical record, with its first mention dating back to 1166 as "Portubanni". Portalban has a rich heritage as a harbor and fishing village, playing a crucial role in local trade and fishing activities for centuries.

Both villages are situated in a region of significant archaeological importance, particularly noted for prehistoric pile dwellings that have provided valuable insights into early agrarian societies in the area.

### Context of the Municipal Merger

The creation of Delley-Portalban through the merger of these two historic villages is part of a broader trend of municipal consolidation in Switzerland. This trend has been particularly notable since the 1990s and is driven by several factors:

1. **Administrative Efficiency**: The merger was likely motivated by the need to streamline administrative processes and improve the delivery of public services. Smaller municipalities often face challenges due to limited resources and personnel.

2. **National Trend**: Between 1850 and 2011, the number of municipalities in Switzerland decreased from 3,203 to 2,515, indicating a gradual but consistent trend towards consolidation. The formation of Delley-Portalban aligns with this national strategy to enhance local governance efficiency.

3. **Legislative Support**: The process of municipal mergers in Switzerland is supported by cantonal legislation, which provides the necessary framework and incentives for municipalities to merge.

### Geographical and Demographic Information

Delley-Portalban is located in the district of Broye, within the canton of Fribourg, Switzerland. The municipality is situated along the shores of Lake Neuchâtel, making it a significant tourist hub in the three lakes area. It features a well-known marina and offers scenic walking paths along forest edges and marshlands.

As of the latest available data, Portalban, one of the villages within the municipality, has approximately 322 residents. This gives an indication of the relatively small size of the community, which likely contributed to the decision to merge for more efficient governance.

### Conclusion

The creation of Delley-Portalban on January 1, 2005, represents a significant milestone in local Swiss governance. This merger brought together two villages with rich, distinct histories dating back to the Middle Ages. The consolidation reflects broader Swiss administrative reforms aimed at improving efficiency and service delivery in smaller municipalities. The process aligns with a national trend of municipal mergers that has been ongoing since the 1990s, supported by cantonal legislation and driven by the need for more effective local governance in the face of increasing administrative complexities.

To obtain the most precise and official documentation of this merger, one would need to consult local government records, cantonal archives, or submit formal information requests to the relevant Swiss authorities. These steps would ensure access to the original administrative documents detailing the exact circumstances and legal framework of the Delley-Portalban merger.
