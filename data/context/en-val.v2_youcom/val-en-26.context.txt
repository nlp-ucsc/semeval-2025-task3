Based on the comprehensive research reports provided, I can confidently state that the Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI) is indeed still maintained and continues to play a significant role in the academic world. Let's analyze the gathered information to provide a detailed overview of its current status:

### Maintenance and Management

The Arts and Humanities Citation Index is actively maintained by Clarivate Analytics, a global company specializing in insights and analytics to accelerate innovation. Clarivate acquired the Web of Science, which includes the AHCI, from Thomson Reuters in 2016 and has since been responsible for its management and development. This ongoing maintenance ensures that the AHCI remains a reliable and up-to-date resource for researchers in the arts and humanities fields.

The index is regularly updated to include new publications and citations, with weekly updates ensuring that researchers have access to the most current data. This continuous curation and maintenance by Clarivate Analytics underscore the index's ongoing relevance and utility in academic research.

### Current Status and Coverage

As of the latest available information, the AHCI maintains an extensive coverage of scholarly literature in the arts and humanities:

1. It indexes over 1,100 of the world's leading arts and humanities journals.
2. The index also includes selected items from more than 6,800 major science and social science journals, enhancing its interdisciplinary scope.
3. The AHCI covers a wide range of disciplines, including archaeology, art, architecture, Asian studies, classics, dance, folklore, history, language, linguistics, literary reviews, literature, music, philosophy, poetry, radio, television, film, religion, and theatre.
4. It encompasses various document types, such as original research articles, reviews, editorials, meeting abstracts, poems, short stories, plays, and music scores.

This comprehensive coverage demonstrates the AHCI's continued commitment to providing a robust resource for arts and humanities researchers.

### Recent Updates and Relevance in Academic Research

The AHCI has undergone significant recent updates that reinforce its importance in the academic world:

1. **Expansion of Journal Impact Factors**: In a major development for the 2023 release of the Journal Citation Reports (JCR), Clarivate expanded the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) to include all journals indexed in the AHCI. This change marks a substantial shift towards a more inclusive evaluation of scholarly impact across disciplines, particularly benefiting arts and humanities journals that were previously not included in JIF calculations.

2. **Increased Journal Coverage**: The 2023 JCR release expanded to cover more than 21,500 high-quality academic journals across over 250 scientific and research disciplines. This expansion included more than 9,000 journals receiving a JIF for the first time, many of which are from the AHCI. This increase in coverage levels the playing field for all quality journals, including those that are open access or recently launched.

3. **Changes in JIF Presentation**: The 2023 JCR now presents the JIF with one decimal place instead of three, encouraging users to consider additional indicators and descriptive data when comparing journals. This change promotes a more holistic understanding of a journal's influence and impact.

4. **Commitment to Research Integrity**: Clarivate has emphasized its commitment to maintaining the integrity of the scholarly record through rigorous selection processes for journals included in the Web of Science Core Collection, which includes the AHCI. This ensures that only journals meeting stringent quality criteria are indexed, providing reliable data and metrics for the academic community.

### Current Relevance in Academic Research

The AHCI remains highly relevant in academic research for several reasons:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: It provides extensive coverage of journals in the arts and humanities, which are often underrepresented in other citation databases.

2. **Interdisciplinary Research Support**: The index facilitates interdisciplinary research by allowing scholars to explore connections between the arts, humanities, and other disciplines.

3. **Benchmarking and Evaluation**: Academic institutions and funding bodies use the AHCI to evaluate the impact of research outputs, which is critical for career progression and funding decisions.

4. **Scholarly Communication**: By tracking citations, the AHCI facilitates scholarly communication and collaboration, helping researchers identify key works and authors in their field.

5. **Research Discovery**: The AHCI enhances research discovery by providing a navigable network of arts and humanities research, helping researchers break out of research silos and make interdisciplinary connections.

6. **Reliable Data Source**: The index ensures that the data discovered is from trusted, reliable sources, with editorial experts continuously curating the collection to maintain its integrity.

In conclusion, the Arts and Humanities Citation Index is not only still maintained but has also undergone significant recent updates that reinforce its importance in the academic world. Its comprehensive coverage, regular updates, and integration with other research tools make it an essential resource for scholars in the arts and humanities. The recent expansion of the Journal Impact Factor to include AHCI journals further cements its relevance in academic evaluation and research assessment. As the academic landscape continues to evolve, the AHCI's ability to adapt and provide relevant data ensures its ongoing significance and utility in scholarly research.
