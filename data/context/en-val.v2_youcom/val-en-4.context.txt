2. **Avoiding Record Labels**: Despite early meetings with major labels, Chance chose to remain independent. This decision shaped his career trajectory and set him apart from many of his peers.

3. **Grassroots Promotion**: Chance utilized the internet and word-of-mouth to promote his music, especially during the early days of his career when he was working on "10 Day" during his senior year of high school.
