Gillette Stadium, located in Foxborough, Massachusetts, has an interesting history when it comes to its naming. The stadium, which serves as the home for both the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL) and the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer (MLS), has undergone a name change since its initial conception.

### Previous Name

The previous name of Gillette Stadium was CMGI Field. This name was given to the stadium during its planning and initial construction phases. CMGI, a technology company, had originally secured the naming rights for the new stadium. However, this name was short-lived and never actually used for official games.

### Name Change History

The transition from CMGI Field to Gillette Stadium occurred in 2002, coinciding with the stadium's official opening. This change was prompted by the "dot-com" bust, which affected many technology companies, including CMGI. As a result of these economic shifts, Gillette acquired the naming rights to the stadium.

Gillette Stadium officially opened its doors on September 9, 2002, bearing its current name. Since then, it has been known as Gillette Stadium, and has even earned the colloquial nickname "The Razor," a clever reference to Gillette's primary product line.

### Previous Stadium Names

It's worth noting that while Gillette Stadium itself only had one previous name (CMGI Field), the Patriots' previous home stadium underwent several name changes:

1. The team's previous venue was called Foxboro Stadium.
2. When it opened in 1971, it was initially named Schaefer Stadium, after the Schaefer Brewing Company.
3. In 1983, it was renamed Sullivan Stadium in honor of the team's founder.
4. The Patriots played their final game at Foxboro Stadium in 2001 before moving to the newly constructed Gillette Stadium.

### Summary

In conclusion, the previous name of Gillette Stadium was CMGI Field, though this name was never used for official games. The name change to Gillette Stadium occurred in 2002 when Gillette acquired the naming rights following the "dot-com" bust. This change happened concurrently with the stadium's official opening on September 9, 2002. Since then, Gillette Stadium has been the home of the New England Patriots and New England Revolution, hosting numerous sporting events, concerts, and other special occasions.

The stadium, with its current seating capacity of 65,878, has become an iconic venue in American sports, continuing the legacy of its predecessors while establishing its own identity under the Gillette name.
