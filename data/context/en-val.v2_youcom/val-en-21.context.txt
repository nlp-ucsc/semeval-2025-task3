To address the original research question about the similarities and differences between kremlins and detinets, I will compile and analyze the gathered information to provide a comprehensive comparison.

## Similarities between Kremlins and Detinets

### 1. Definition and Purpose

Both kremlins and detinets refer to fortified complexes that served as central structures in medieval Russian cities. They share similar primary purposes:

- **Defense**: Both were designed to protect against invasions and serve as strongholds. The Moscow Kremlin, for instance, has walls between 16 and 62 feet tall with 20 towers, while the Novgorod Detinets was described as an impregnable fortress during the 11th to 13th centuries.

- **Administrative Centers**: Kremlins and detinets functioned as seats of power and administration. The Moscow Kremlin has been the residence of Russian tsars and is currently the official residence of the President of Russia, while detinets like the Novgorod Detinets served as administrative centers for their respective cities.

- **Religious Significance**: Both types of structures often housed important religious buildings. The Moscow Kremlin includes several massive churches, and the Novgorod Detinets houses the Cathedral of Holy Wisdom and served as an ecclesiastical site.

### 2. Historical Context

Kremlins and detinets share a similar historical context:

- **Origins**: Both structures trace their origins to the early medieval period when Slavic peoples began constructing fortresses to protect their lands.

- **Evolution**: Initially built from wood, both kremlins and detinets were later reconstructed using stone and brick for increased durability. This evolution is evident in structures like the Moscow Kremlin and the Novgorod Detinets.

### 3. Architectural Features

Kremlins and detinets share several architectural characteristics:

- **Fortifications**: Both feature robust walls and towers. The Moscow Kremlin has walls up to 62 feet tall, while the Novgorod Detinets has walls ranging from 8 to 15 meters in height.

- **Internal Structures**: Both types of complexes typically encompass various buildings, including cathedrals, palaces, and administrative offices.

## Differences between Kremlins and Detinets

### 1. Terminology and Usage

- **Historical Usage**: The term "detinets" is considered older and was more commonly used in specific regions like Novgorod and Pskov. "Kremlin" became more widely used from the 14th century onward.

- **Etymology**: The word "kremlin" means "citadel" or "fortress" in Russian, while "detinets" possibly derives from the Old East Slavic word "deti" meaning "children," suggesting it was a place to protect the vulnerable during sieges.

### 2. Specific Functions

- **Residence of Rulers**: While kremlins often served as residences for rulers (e.g., the Moscow Kremlin for tsars and now the President), some detinets, like the Novgorod Detinets, did not serve as residences for ruling princes, who lived across the river.

- **Ecclesiastical Focus**: Detinets, particularly the Novgorod Detinets, had a stronger emphasis on being ecclesiastical sites, whereas kremlins balanced religious, administrative, and residential functions more evenly.

### 3. Geographical Distribution

- **Kremlins**: The term is more widely used across Russia and is often associated with major cities like Moscow, Kazan, and Nizhny Novgorod.

- **Detinets**: This term is more specifically associated with certain regions, particularly Novgorod and Pskov.

### 4. Modern Usage and Recognition

- **Kremlins**: The term "kremlin" is more widely recognized internationally, often used to refer specifically to the Moscow Kremlin as a symbol of Russian power and governance.

- **Detinets**: This term is less commonly used in modern contexts and is often explained in relation to kremlins when discussing historical structures.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, kremlins and detinets share many fundamental similarities in their purpose, historical context, and architectural features. Both served as fortified complexes central to the defense, administration, and religious life of medieval Russian cities. The main differences lie in their terminology, specific regional usage, and some nuances in their functions. The term "kremlin" has become more widely recognized and used, particularly in reference to the Moscow Kremlin, while "detinets" remains a more historically and regionally specific term. Despite these differences, the two terms are often used interchangeably when discussing historical Russian fortifications, reflecting their closely related nature and shared historical significance.
