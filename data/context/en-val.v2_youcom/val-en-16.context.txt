There appears to be conflicting information regarding the host city of the 26th Biathlon World Championships. Let's examine the available information and attempt to resolve this discrepancy.

## Conflicting Reports

1. 1991 in Lahti, Finland:
One research report suggests that the 26th Biathlon World Championships were held in 1991 in Lahti, Finland. This report claims that it was the second time Lahti had hosted the event. The source for this information is described as explicit and clear.

2. 2024 in Nové Město na Moravě, Czech Republic:
Another research report states that the 26th Biathlon World Championships took place in 2024, from February 7 to February 18, in Nové Město na Moravě, Czech Republic. This report mentions that the event was held at the Vysočina Arena and that it was the second time Nové Město na Moravě had hosted the championships, with the first time being in 2013.

## Analysis of the Discrepancy

The significant difference in the reported years (1991 vs. 2024) and locations (Lahti, Finland vs. Nové Město na Moravě, Czech Republic) suggests that there might be an error in one of the research reports or a misunderstanding of the numbering system for the championships.

## Possible Explanations

1. Numbering System Change:
It's possible that the numbering system for the Biathlon World Championships changed at some point, leading to a discrepancy in what is considered the "26th" championship.

2. Error in Reporting:
One of the research reports may contain an error, either in the numbering of the championship or in the identification of the host city and year.

3. Different Events:
The reports might be referring to different events within the biathlon world championships series, such as separate events for different categories or disciplines.

## Verification Needed

To resolve this discrepancy and provide accurate information about the 26th Biathlon World Championships, further verification is required. This could involve:

1. Checking official records from the International Biathlon Union (IBU), the governing body for biathlon competitions.
2. Reviewing historical archives of biathlon championships to confirm the chronological order and numbering of events.
3. Investigating whether there have been any changes in the way championships are numbered or categorized over time.
4. Confirming whether both reported events actually took place and understanding their relationship to the official numbering of world championships.

## Conclusion

Based on the conflicting information provided, it is not possible to definitively confirm the host city of the 26th Biathlon World Championships without further research. The discrepancy between the two reports highlights the need for additional verification from official sources to determine the accurate information regarding the host city, year, and numbering of this specific championship event.

To provide a conclusive answer, it would be necessary to consult the official records of the International Biathlon Union or other authoritative sources in the field of biathlon competitions. Until such verification can be obtained, both reported locations and dates should be treated as potentially valid, but requiring further confirmation.
