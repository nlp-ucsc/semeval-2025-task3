To definitively answer who was the father of Carl Löwenhielm, we need to carefully analyze and compile all the gathered information from various sources. Let's examine the evidence and draw a conclusion based on the available data.

## Carl Löwenhielm's Background

First, let's establish some key facts about Carl Löwenhielm himself:

Carl Axel Löwenhielm was a prominent Swedish figure who lived from November 3, 1772, to June 9, 1861. He was known for his multifaceted career as a military officer, diplomat, and politician. Löwenhielm served as a member of the Swedish cabinet from 1822 to 1839, highlighting his significant involvement in political affairs. His diverse roles in the military, diplomatic, and political spheres underscore his importance in Swedish society during the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

## Conflicting Information on Carl Löwenhielm's Father

When it comes to identifying Carl Löwenhielm's father, we encounter some conflicting information that requires careful analysis:

1. **Royal Parentage Claim**: 
   One source states that Carl Axel Löwenhielm was an illegitimate son of King Charles XIII of Sweden. This claim, if true, would place Carl Löwenhielm in a unique position within the Swedish aristocracy and explain his rise to prominence.

2. **Noble Parentage Claim**: 
   Contradicting the royal parentage claim, another source indicates that Carl Löwenhielm's father was Count Axel Löwenhielm, a distinguished member of the Swedish nobility who held various positions within the Swedish court and was known for his influence in political and social circles.

## Analysis of Available Evidence

To resolve this contradiction, we need to examine the reliability and consistency of the available information:

1. **Historical Records and Genealogical Databases**: 
   The Swedish Death Index, Census Records, and church records available through services like ArkivDigital and the National Archives (Riksarkivet) are crucial for verifying family relationships. These records typically provide official documentation of births, marriages, and deaths, which would be essential in confirming Carl Löwenhielm's parentage.

2. **Biographical Sources**: 
   A biographical description of Carl Löwenhielm from a 1923 publication is mentioned as a potential source of detailed information about his life and family background. This could provide valuable insights into how his parentage was understood during his lifetime or shortly after.

3. **Genealogical Archives**: 
   The Värmland Archives are noted as a valuable resource for tracing the Löwenhielm family history. These archives likely contain records or references to Carl Löwenhielm's family, including information about his father.

4. **Cross-referencing**: 
   By examining and cross-referencing details such as dates, locations, and family connections from multiple sources, we can build a more accurate picture of Carl Löwenhielm's parentage.

## Conclusion: The Identity of Carl Löwenhielm's Father

After careful analysis of the available information, we can conclude that there is significant uncertainty regarding the true identity of Carl Löwenhielm's father. The conflicting claims of royal versus noble parentage present a historical mystery that requires further investigation.

1. **Royal Parentage Theory**: 
   The claim that Carl Löwenhielm was an illegitimate son of King Charles XIII of Sweden is intriguing and would explain his rise to prominence. However, this claim requires substantial evidence to be verified, given the significant implications it would have on Swedish royal history.

2. **Noble Parentage Theory**: 
   The assertion that Count Axel Löwenhielm was Carl's father appears to be supported by more conventional genealogical research. This claim aligns with Carl Löwenhielm's noble status and his career trajectory within the Swedish aristocracy.

Given the conflicting information, it is crucial to emphasize that a definitive answer cannot be provided without further in-depth research into primary historical sources. To resolve this question conclusively, one would need to:

1. Examine original birth records or baptismal registers from the time of Carl Löwenhielm's birth in 1772.
2. Investigate any legal documents or royal decrees that might pertain to Carl Löwenhielm's status, especially if he was indeed of royal parentage.
3. Analyze personal correspondence or diaries of Carl Löwenhielm, King Charles XIII, or Count Axel Löwenhielm that might shed light on their relationships.
4. Conduct DNA testing of descendants, if possible, to establish genetic links to either the royal family or the Löwenhielm noble line.

In conclusion, while we have gathered significant information about Carl Löwenhielm's life and career, the true identity of his father remains a subject of historical debate. The conflicting claims of royal versus noble parentage highlight the complexity of genealogical research, especially when dealing with figures of historical importance. Further research into primary sources and possibly genetic analysis would be necessary to definitively answer this intriguing question about Carl Löwenhielm's paternity.
