To answer your question about the number of genera in the Erysiphales order and note any discrepancies or recent changes in classification, I'll compile and analyze the information from the research reports provided. It's important to note that fungal taxonomy, particularly for Erysiphales, has been undergoing significant revisions due to advances in molecular phylogenetic analyses.

### Overview of Erysiphales

Erysiphales is an order of fungi within the class Leotiomycetes, phylum Ascomycota. These fungi are primarily known for causing powdery mildew, a common plant disease characterized by a white, powdery coating on plant surfaces. They are obligate biotrophic pathogens, meaning they can only grow and reproduce on living host plants.

### Number of Genera in Erysiphales

Determining the exact number of genera in the Erysiphales order is challenging due to ongoing taxonomic revisions. However, we can provide some insights based on the available information:

1. **Historical Estimate**: The order Erysiphales was estimated to contain about 500 species. This estimate, however, doesn't directly indicate the number of genera.

2. **Recent Taxonomic Changes**: The taxonomy of Erysiphales has undergone significant revisions, particularly with the advent of DNA sequencing technologies. These changes have affected the classification at both the genus and species levels.

3. **Molecular Phylogenetic Analyses**: Recent comprehensive genome-scale phylogenetic analyses have been conducted using 751 single-copy orthologous sequences from 24 powdery mildew genomes. These studies have challenged the traditional generic concept of Erysiphales, leading to significant changes in taxonomy, especially at the genus level.

4. **Integration into Helotiales**: Recent class-wide multi-gene phylogenies have indicated that Erysiphales is now considered a member of the Helotiales order. This integration reflects a broader understanding of evolutionary relationships within the Leotiomycetes class and may impact the classification of genera within Erysiphales.

### Discrepancies and Recent Changes

1. **Morphological vs. Molecular Classification**: There is a discrepancy between traditional morphological classification and modern molecular-based classification. Molecular phylogenetic analyses have shown that morphological characteristics do not always reflect phylogenetic relationships. This has led to reclassification of several genera and species within the order.

2. **Ongoing Revisions**: The taxonomy of Erysiphales is in a state of flux, with ongoing revisions based on new molecular data. This makes it difficult to provide a definitive count of genera that would remain stable over time.

3. **Complex Species Complexes**: Studies have focused on resolving complex taxonomic issues within Erysiphales, such as the "Erysiphe trifoliorum complex". These investigations may lead to further changes in the number and composition of genera.

4. **Integration of Genomic Data**: The integration of genomic data is providing new insights into the relationships and taxonomy of Erysiphales. This ongoing process may continue to reshape our understanding of genera within the order.

### Conclusion

While we cannot provide an exact number of genera in the Erysiphales order due to the dynamic nature of its taxonomy, it's clear that the classification is undergoing significant changes. The traditional concept of genera within this order has been challenged by molecular data, leading to revisions at both the genus and species levels.

To obtain the most up-to-date information on the number of genera, it would be necessary to consult the latest versions of authoritative databases such as Index Fungorum and MycoBank. These databases are regularly updated with new taxonomic data and nomenclatural changes, reflecting the most current understanding of Erysiphales classification.

For researchers and mycologists interested in the most accurate and current classification of Erysiphales genera, it is recommended to:

1. Regularly check authoritative databases like Index Fungorum and MycoBank.
2. Follow recent scientific literature and reviews on Erysiphales taxonomy.
3. Be aware of the ongoing nature of taxonomic revisions in this group.
4. Consider both traditional morphological characteristics and modern molecular data when studying these fungi.

In summary, the number of genera in Erysiphales is a moving target due to ongoing taxonomic revisions. The integration of molecular and genomic data continues to refine our understanding of this important group of plant pathogens, making it an exciting and dynamic area of mycological research.
