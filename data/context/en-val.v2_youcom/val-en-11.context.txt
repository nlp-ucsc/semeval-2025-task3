The merger resulted in the formation of a new company known as TOMY Co., Ltd., or TAKARATOMY in Japanese.

### Context and Background of the Merger

#### Pre-Merger History

To fully understand the context of the merger, it's important to consider the rich histories of both companies:

1. **Tomy**: Founded in 1924 by Eiichiro Tomiyama as Tomiyama Toy Factory, Tomy initially gained recognition for its innovative toy airplanes. The company was a pioneer in the toy industry, establishing a factory with an assembly line system and creating a toy research department. In 1963, it officially changed its name to Tomy and began expanding internationally in the 1970s and 1980s.

2. **Takara**: Established in 1955 by Yasuta Satō as Sato Vinyl, the company later became Takara Vinyl in 1960 and finally Takara in 1966. Takara achieved significant success with the launch of "Licca-chan," a fashion doll similar to Barbie, in 1967. The company also played a crucial role in the development of the Transformers franchise through its Diaclone and Micro Change lines.

#### Merger Announcement and Motivation

The merger between Takara and Tomy was publicly announced in May 2005, nearly a year before its official completion. This strategic move was driven by several factors:

1. **Market Consolidation**: The merger aimed to strengthen the companies' market positions and leverage their combined strengths to compete more effectively in the global toy market.

2. **Industry Trends**: The merger followed similar consolidations in the industry, such as the merger between Bandai and Namco.

3. **Market Challenges**: Both companies were facing challenges due to a shrinking Japanese toy market, partly attributed to an aging population.

4. **Financial Considerations**: Prior to the merger, Takara was experiencing financial difficulties, which influenced the decision to merge with the more financially stable Tomy.

#### Merger Details and Impact

1. **Merger of Equals**: The merger was characterized as a merger of equals under Japanese corporate law, although Western media often perceived it as a takeover by Tomy due to Takara's financial struggles at the time.

2. **Brand Strategy**: Post-merger, the company decided to use "Tomy" for international branding due to its established recognition, while "Takara Tomy" was used in Japan.

3. **Product Integration**: The merger allowed the combined company to leverage both Takara's and Tomy's product lines and licenses, including popular brands like Transformers, Beyblade, and Zoids.
