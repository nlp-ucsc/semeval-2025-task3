The Sakya Trizin is the hereditary head and spiritual leader of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, responsible for preserving and propagating its teachings and traditions. This prestigious title, which translates to "Holder of the Sakya Throne," has been passed down through the Khön family lineage since the school's founding in 1073 CE. The Sakya Trizin serves as both a spiritual guide and administrative leader, overseeing monasteries, conducting important rituals, and maintaining the integrity of the Sakya tradition.

The role carries significant historical importance, as the Sakya school once held both spiritual and temporal authority over Tibet during the 13th century. Today, the position continues to be a central figure in Tibetan Buddhism, with the current holder being His Holiness Khöndung Gyana Vajra Rinpoche, the 43rd Sakya Trizin. In recent years, the succession process has been modified to a rotational system between two branches of the Khön family, with each Sakya Trizin serving a three-year term to adapt to modern circumstances while preserving the lineage's traditions.
