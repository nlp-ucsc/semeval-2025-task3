Based on the research reports provided, I can offer a comprehensive analysis of the population of Galicia, its recent trends, and how it compares to other regions in Spain.

## Current Population Statistics

As of July 2024, Galicia has a population of approximately 2.7 million inhabitants. This figure places Galicia as the fifth most populous autonomous community in Spain, accounting for about 5.5% of the country's total population of 48.9 million. It's important to note that this data comes from the most recent official statistics available, providing an up-to-date picture of Galicia's demographic situation.

## Demographic Trends and Changes

Over the past decade, Galicia has experienced several significant demographic trends:

1. **Population Decline**: Galicia has seen a decrease of nearly 100,000 people in its population over the last decade. This decline is part of a broader trend affecting the region and has prompted collaboration with the European Union to address these demographic challenges.

2. **Aging Population**: The age distribution in Galicia reveals an aging population trend. The largest age group consists of individuals between 45 and 49 years old, numbering 231,000 people. Moreover, there is a substantial elderly population, with 58,616 residents aged 90 years and older. This aging trend is consistent with patterns observed in many parts of Europe.

3. **Foreign Immigration**: Despite the overall population decline, Galicia has experienced an influx of approximately 65,000 foreigners over a little more than a decade. While this number may seem relatively small compared to the total population, it represents a notable trend of foreign immigration contributing to the region's demographic makeup.

4. **Rural Depopulation**: There is a clear trend of rural depopulation in Galicia. As of 2018, only 22% of entrepreneurs were located in rural areas, which is below the average for the RESOE regions but above the national average for Spain. This suggests a movement away from rural areas, potentially contributing to the overall population decline.

## Comparison with Other Spanish Regions

When comparing Galicia to other Spanish regions, several points stand out:

1. **Population Distribution**: Unlike regions such as Madrid or Catalonia, Galicia does not have a single dominant metropolis. Instead, its population is more evenly distributed across its four provinces: A Coru√±a, Lugo, Ourense, and Pontevedra. This contrasts with Madrid, for example, which has over 3.3 million residents in its capital city alone.

2. **Employment Trends**: Galicia has experienced a moderate decline in employment share, similar to other regions such as the Basque Country and provinces along the Mediterranean coast. This trend may be related to the broader demographic changes occurring in the region.

3. **Cultural and Linguistic Identity**: A significant portion of Galicia's population speaks Galician, a language closely related to Portuguese. This distinctive cultural feature sets Galicia apart from many other Spanish regions and contributes to its unique identity within Spain.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Galicia's population of 2.7 million as of 2024 represents a significant portion of Spain's total population. However, the region faces notable demographic challenges, including an overall population decline, an aging population, and rural depopulation. These trends are partially offset by foreign immigration, but the long-term implications of these demographic shifts remain a concern for regional planners and policymakers.

Galicia's unique position as a region without a dominant metropolis, combined with its distinctive cultural and linguistic identity, sets it apart from other Spanish autonomous communities. As Galicia continues to navigate these demographic changes, it will likely require ongoing collaboration with national and European institutions to address the challenges and opportunities presented by its evolving population dynamics.
