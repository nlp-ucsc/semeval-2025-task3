To determine when Toruń was part of the Hanseatic League and provide relevant historical context, let's analyze the gathered information comprehensively.

## Toruń's Membership in the Hanseatic League

Toruń became a member of the Hanseatic League around 1280 and remained an active participant in the League's trade network until 1411. This period of approximately 131 years marked a significant era in Toruń's history, during which the city experienced substantial growth and development as a major commercial hub.

## Historical Context

### Founding and Early Development of Toruń

To understand the context of Toruń's membership in the Hanseatic League, it's essential to consider the city's origins and early development:

1. Toruń was established by the Teutonic Knights in 1231, who built a fortress in the area due to its strategic location on the Vistula River.
2. In 1233, the city was officially founded when it received its town charter from Teutonic Knights Hermann von Salza and Hermann Balk.
3. The original settlement was relocated in 1236 due to flooding, leading to the establishment of what is now known as the Old Town.
4. By 1264, Toruń had grown significantly, necessitating the establishment of the New Town to accommodate the increasing population of craftsmen and artisans.

This rapid development in the early years set the stage for Toruń's entry into the Hanseatic League, as the city had already established itself as a growing commercial center.

### The Hanseatic League: Origins and Expansion

The Hanseatic League itself has a rich history that provides context for Toruń's membership:

1. The League's origins can be traced back to the 12th century when merchants from Lower Germany began forming alliances to protect their trading interests.
2. The term "Hanse" is derived from a medieval German word for "guild" or "association".
3. The League's early development was marked by the establishment of trade routes and the formation of alliances between cities, with Lübeck becoming a central hub due to its strategic location on the Baltic Sea.
4. By 1241, Lübeck and Hamburg had formed a mutual protection pact, marking a significant step towards the formal establishment of the League.

### Broader Context of Polish Cities in the Hanseatic League

2. This led to the First Peace of Thorn in 1411, marking the end of Toruń's membership in the Hanseatic League.
3. Although the city briefly returned to Teutonic control, it permanently became part of Poland after the Second Peace of Thorn in 1466.
