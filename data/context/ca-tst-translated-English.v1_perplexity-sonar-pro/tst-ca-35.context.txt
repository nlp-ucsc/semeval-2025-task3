Garajonay National Park was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986[1][2][4]. The park, located on the island of La Gomera in Spain's Canary Islands, was first declared a national park in 1981[1][2]. It gained international recognition and protection when UNESCO added it to the World Heritage List during the 10th session of the World Heritage Committee in 1986[6][9].

The park was recognized for its exceptional natural value, particularly its well-preserved laurel forest (laurisilva), which is a rare remnant of the subtropical forests that once covered much of Europe and North Africa during the Tertiary period[4][5]. This unique ecosystem, sustained by the unusual climatic conditions of the island, hosts a large number of endemic plant and animal species, making it an important site for biodiversity conservation[5].

The designation as a World Heritage Site in 1986 acknowledged the park's global significance in terms of its natural beauty, ecological importance, and scientific value. This status has helped to ensure the continued protection and conservation of this remarkable natural area, which covers approximately 40 square kilometers (15 square miles) of La Gomera's central and northern regions[1][5].
