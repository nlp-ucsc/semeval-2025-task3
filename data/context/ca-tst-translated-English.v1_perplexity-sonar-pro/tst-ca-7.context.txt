Agistri (also spelled Angistri or Agkistri) belongs to the Saronic Islands group[1][3][4]. The Saronic Islands, also known as the Argo-Saronic Islands, are an archipelago located in the Saronic Gulf, just off the Greek mainland[3].

The main inhabited islands in the Saronic group include:

1. Salamis
2. Aegina
3. Agistri
4. Poros

Some sources also include Hydra and Spetses as part of the Saronic Islands, though they technically lie between the Saronic Gulf and the Argolic Gulf[3][4].

Agistri is one of the smaller islands in this group, with an area of about 13 square kilometers (5 square miles) and a population of around 1,142 as of the 2011 census[1][3]. Despite its small size, Agistri is a popular destination for tourists and Athenians seeking a quick getaway, thanks to its proximity to Athens and its natural beauty[4][5].

The island is known for its:

1. Pine-covered landscapes
2. Beautiful beaches like Aponissos, Dragonera, and Halikiada
3. Picturesque villages such as Skala, Megalochori (also called Milos), and Limenaria
4. Clear waters ideal for swimming and water sports
5. Relaxed atmosphere, making it perfect for peaceful vacations[5][6]

Agistri's location in the Saronic Gulf makes it easily accessible from Athens, with ferry rides taking about an hour from the port of Piraeus[6][7]. This proximity to the Greek capital contributes to its popularity as a weekend destination and for day trips from Athens.
