Joel Hastings Metcalf discovered the asteroid (661) Cloelia on February 22, 1908[3]. Metcalf was an American astronomer, humanitarian, and Unitarian minister who discovered or co-discovered several comets and 41 asteroids between 1905 and 1914[5].

Some key details about the discovery and the asteroid:

1. Discovery location: Metcalf discovered Cloelia from the observatory in Taunton, United States[1].

2. Initial designation: The asteroid initially received the provisional designation 1908 CL[1][3].

3. Naming: It was later named after Cloelia, a legendary heroic woman from ancient Roman history[1][3].

4. Orbital characteristics:
   - Cloelia is a main-belt asteroid[3][7].
   - It has an orbital period of 1914 days (about 5.24 years)[1].
   - Its average distance from the Sun is 3.017 astronomical units[1].
   - The orbital inclination is 9.232 degrees[1].

5. Physical properties:
   - Diameter: Approximately 40.081 ± 0.239 kilometers[7].
   - Rotation period: About 5.536 hours[7].

6. Classification: Cloelia is a member of the Eos family of asteroids, which likely formed from the collisional breakup of a parent body[3].

Metcalf was a prolific asteroid discoverer, with Cloelia being just one of his many discoveries. Two asteroids, 726 Joëlla and 792 Metcalfia, were later named in his honor[5].
