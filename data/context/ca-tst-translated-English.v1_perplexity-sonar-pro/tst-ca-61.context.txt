The MBR-200, or Movimiento Bolivariano Revolucionario 200 (Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200), was a political and social movement founded by Hugo Chávez in Venezuela in 1982[1]. Initially established as a clandestine organization within the Venezuelan military, it played a significant role in shaping the country's political landscape in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

Key aspects of the MBR-200 include:

1. Foundation and Early Years:
The movement was initially founded as the Revolutionary Bolivarian Army 200 (EBR-200) by Chávez and fellow military officers Felipe Acosta Carles and Jesús Urdaneta Hernández on December 17, 1982[1]. The founders swore an oath under a tree at Samán de Güere, near Maracay, inspired by Simón Bolívar's 1805 pledge to liberate Venezuela from Spanish rule[1].

2. Ideology and Goals:
The MBR-200 was based on Chávez's interpretation of Simón Bolívar's philosophy, rejecting the existing democratic system and advocating for a radical transformation of Venezuelan society[2]. It aimed to overthrow the government and establish a more just system, as perceived by its members[4].

3. Evolution and Expansion:
Initially more of a political study circle, the movement gradually evolved into a subversive organization[1]. It expanded its membership, recruiting both military personnel and civilians. By 1989, it changed its name from EBR-200 to MBR-200 to reflect the inclusion of civilian members[1].

4. 1992 Coup Attempt:
The MBR-200 is most notably known for planning and executing the failed coup attempt on February 4, 1992[1][2]. This event, although unsuccessful, catapulted Chávez into the national spotlight and garnered sympathy from large segments of the Venezuelan population[2].

5. Transition to Electoral Politics:
After Chávez's release from prison in 1994, the movement began to consider participating in electoral politics. This led to the formation of the Movement for the Fifth Republic (MVR) in 1997, which served as the electoral vehicle for Chávez's successful 1998 presidential campaign[1][2].

6. Legacy and Transformation:
The ideals and structure of the MBR-200 continued to influence Venezuelan politics even after Chávez's election. In 2001, Chávez proposed relaunching the original MBR-200, which eventually led to the creation of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) in 2007[1][2].

The MBR-200 played a crucial role in Venezuela's political transformation, evolving from a clandestine military movement to the foundation of a political party that dominated Venezuelan politics for over a decade under Chávez's leadership.
