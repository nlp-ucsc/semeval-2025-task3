The Dukan diet consists of four distinct phases designed to promote weight loss and maintain results long-term:

1. Attack Phase
This initial phase aims to jumpstart weight loss through a strict high-protein diet[1][2]. It typically lasts 1-10 days, depending on how much weight you want to lose[2]. During this phase, you can eat unlimited lean proteins, 1.5 tablespoons of oat bran daily, and must exercise for 20 minutes each day[2][5].

2. Cruise Phase 
The second phase alternates between "pure protein" days and days that include both proteins and non-starchy vegetables[1][2]. This phase lasts about 3 days for every pound you want to lose[2][4]. The goal is steady weight loss of around 2 pounds per week[5]. Oat bran intake increases to 2 tablespoons daily, and 30 minutes of exercise is required[2].

3. Consolidation Phase
This phase gradually reintroduces previously forbidden foods in small quantities to prevent rapid weight regain[1][2]. The length depends on how much weight was lost - typically 5 days for every pound lost in the Cruise phase[2][5]. You can now include limited amounts of fruit, whole grains, and cheese. Two "celebration meals" per week are allowed[2]. One day per week should still be protein-only[2][5].

4. Stabilization Phase
The final phase is meant to be a lifelong approach to maintain your weight loss[1][2]. You can eat normally while following three key rules:
- Consume 3 tablespoons of oat bran daily
- Take the stairs instead of elevators/escalators when possible 
- Have one pure protein day per week (following the Attack phase menu)[1][2][5]

Throughout all phases, the diet emphasizes high protein intake, gradual reintroduction of other food groups, and regular exercise to achieve and maintain weight loss goals[2][4][5].
