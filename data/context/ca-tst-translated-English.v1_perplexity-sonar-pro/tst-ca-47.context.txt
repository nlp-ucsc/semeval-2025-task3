(19521) Chaos was discovered on November 19, 1998 by the Deep Ecliptic Survey using the 4-meter telescope at Kitt Peak Observatory near Sells, Arizona[1][2][6]. The Deep Ecliptic Survey was a project aimed at searching for Kuiper Belt objects, and it was responsible for discovering about two-thirds of the known Kuiper Belt objects at the time of its completion[7].

The discovery of Chaos was part of a broader effort to explore and understand the outer regions of our solar system, particularly the Kuiper Belt. This region, located beyond Neptune's orbit, contains numerous small bodies and has been a focus of astronomical research since the 1990s.

Chaos is classified as a cubewano, which is a type of Kuiper Belt object that is not in resonance with any planet[6]. It orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 45.796 astronomical units, with an orbital period of approximately 309 years[6].

Since its discovery, further observations and studies have been conducted on Chaos, including stellar occultations which have provided more information about its size and shape. Current estimates suggest that Chaos is likely a compact or contact binary equivalent to a sphere 400 to 500 km in diameter[6].
