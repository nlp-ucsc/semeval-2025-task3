Maroilles cheese is primarily produced in the northern regions of France, specifically:

1. Hauts-de-France (formerly Nord-Pas-de-Calais)[1][7]
   - This region includes the departments of Nord and Aisne[1][2]

2. Thi√©rache[2][4]
   - This is a natural area that straddles the southern part of the Nord department and the northern part of the Aisne department[2]

3. Avesnois[1]
   - This is the region around the city of Avesnes in the Nord department

The production area of Maroilles is strictly defined and regulated. There are 189 municipalities in the Nord and Aisne departments that are authorized to produce Maroilles cheese[6]. The cheese gets its name from the village of Maroilles in the Nord department, where it is still produced today[6].

It's worth noting that while the production area has expanded over time, the cheese maintains its strong connection to its place of origin. The specifications for Maroilles production require that at least 80% of the cows' food must come from the region, and the cows must spend at least 170 days outside per year[6]. This helps to maintain the cheese's unique characteristics and its connection to the terroir of northern France.
