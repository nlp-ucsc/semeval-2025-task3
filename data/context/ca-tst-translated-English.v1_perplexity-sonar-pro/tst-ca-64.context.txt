The International Exposition of 1929 in Barcelona featured several notable pavilions designed by prominent architects. Some key pavilions include:

The German Pavilion, designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, is one of the most famous and influential structures from the exposition[1][10]. Built with glass, steel, and four types of marble, it exemplified modernist architecture and became an iconic work. The pavilion was characterized by its radical simplicity, spatial fluidity, and luxurious materials[1].

The Spanish Pavilion was designed by Josep Lluis Sert[3]. It gained attention for housing Pablo Picasso's famous painting "Guernica" as well as works by other Spanish artists like Joan Mir√≥[3].

The Finnish Pavilion was designed by Alvar Aalto, who won an architectural competition to create the structure[3]. It featured an innovative curved design that incorporated wood as Finland's prime export material[3].

The American Pavilion was designed by William Templeton Johnson[2]. It consisted of three buildings, including a main structure that later served as the U.S. consulate office[2].

The Soviet Pavilion was designed by Boris Iofan and featured a large figurative sculpture by Vera Mukhina called "Worker and Kolkhoz Woman" on top[3].

The Italian Pavilion's exterior was designed by Marcello Piacentini, combining modern and traditional elements[3]. Giuseppe Pagano was responsible for coordinating the exhibits inside[3].

The British Pavilion was designed by Oliver Hill, though it received criticism for not effectively representing Britain compared to other nations' displays[3].

While not all pavilions' architects are mentioned in the search results, these examples showcase the diverse range of designers and architectural styles present at the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition.
