All curves commonly called ovals share several key traits:

1. Closed shape: Ovals are closed curves, meaning they form a continuous loop without any open ends[1][2][4].

2. Smooth and curved: Ovals are differentiable, meaning they have a smooth appearance without any sharp corners or straight edges[1][2][10].

3. Convex: The shape bulges outward, with no indentations or concave sections[2][10].

4. Resemblance to egg or ellipse: Ovals generally have a shape that is similar to an egg outline or an elongated circle[1][3][4].

5. Lack of straight sides and corners: Ovals have no straight sides or vertices (corners)[1][3][5].

6. Single face: An oval has only one flat curved face[1][5].

7. Elongated or stretched appearance: Compared to a circle, an oval appears stretched or elongated in one direction[3][4][7].

8. No fixed center point: Unlike circles, ovals do not have a constant distance from a center point to all points on their perimeter[1][5].

9. Simple curve: Ovals do not self-intersect or overlap[2][10].

10. Often symmetrical: Many ovals have at least one axis of symmetry, though this is not a strict requirement for all ovals[1][2][10].

It's important to note that while these traits are common to most shapes described as ovals, there is no strict mathematical definition for ovals in general geometry. The term is often used more loosely in everyday language to describe any egg-like or elliptical shape[2][10].
