Kyle Korver played professional basketball in the National Basketball Association (NBA)[1][2]. He had a long and successful career spanning 17 seasons from 2003 to 2020, during which he played for several NBA teams[4]:

1. Philadelphia 76ers (2003-2008)
2. Utah Jazz (2007-2010, 2018-2019)

4. Atlanta Hawks (2012-2017)
5. Cleveland Cavaliers (2017-2018)
6. Milwaukee Bucks (2019-2020)

Korver was known primarily as a shooting guard and small forward[4][5]. He was regarded as one of the greatest three-point shooters in NBA history, ranking among the all-time leaders in both three-pointers made and three-point shooting percentage[1]. Some of his career highlights include:

- Being named an NBA All-Star in 2015 while with the Atlanta Hawks[1]
- Setting the NBA single-season record for three-point shooting percentage (53.6%) in the 2009-10 season[1]
- Leading the NBA in three-point shooting percentage four times[1]
- Reaching the NBA Finals twice with the Cleveland Cavaliers (2017 and 2018)[1]

Korver's exceptional shooting ability made him a valuable player throughout his career, and he was often sought after by teams looking to improve their perimeter offense[1][3]. After retiring as a player, Korver transitioned into a front office role, becoming the assistant general manager for the Atlanta Hawks[1].
