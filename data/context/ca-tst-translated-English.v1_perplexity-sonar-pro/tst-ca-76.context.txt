Microsoft Edge was initially developed under the code name "Project Spartan"[1][2][5]. This code name was used during the early stages of the browser's development and was a reference to the Spartan characters from Microsoft's popular Halo video game series[5].

Microsoft first unveiled the browser in January 2015 using this code name[5]. The company continued to use "Project Spartan" for several months while developing and testing the new browser.

On April 29, 2015, at its Build developer conference, Microsoft officially announced that the browser would be called "Microsoft Edge"[1][2][5][8]. This announcement marked the transition from the code name to the official product name.

The choice of "Edge" as the final name appears to be related to the browser's rendering engine, which is called EdgeHTML[5]. This name also aligns with Microsoft's goal of positioning the browser as a cutting-edge, modern alternative to Internet Explorer.

It's worth noting that while "Project Spartan" was the primary code name used publicly, Microsoft's internal development process may have involved other code names or designations that were not widely publicized.
