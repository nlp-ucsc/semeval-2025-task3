Fredrikstad Fotballklubb (FFK) was founded in 1903[1][2][3]. Specifically, the club was established on April 7, 1903[9]. This makes Fredrikstad FK one of the oldest football clubs in Norway, with a rich history spanning over 120 years.

Some key points about the club's founding and early history:

1. The 1903 founding was actually the third attempt to establish a football club in Fredrikstad, as there was a lack of opponents in the early years[3].

2. FFK played its first match in the Norwegian Cup (NM) in 1905 against Porsgrund Football Club, but won its first NM match in 1908 against Gj√∏vik-Lyn[3].

3. The club initially struggled to find consistent competition, but football in Norway began to develop more rapidly after World War II[3].

4. Fredrikstad FK went on to become one of the most successful clubs in Norwegian football history, especially during the 1950s and 1960s when they won multiple league titles and cups[2][3].

The long-standing nature of Fredrikstad FK is a point of pride for the club and its supporters, as it represents over a century of football tradition in the city of Fredrikstad.
