The cruiser Emden was built at the Reichsmarinewerft shipyard in Wilhelmshaven, Germany[1][2]. Her keel was laid down on December 8, 1921, and she was launched on January 7, 1925[1][2]. Emden was the first large warship built in Germany after World War I and was commissioned into the German Navy (Reichsmarine) on October 15, 1925[1][2].

The construction of Emden was significantly delayed due to political instability and Germany's financial weakness in the early 1920s[1]. Additionally, there were challenges related to the lack of steel due to Germany's economic hardship, and British objections also contributed to the delay[2].

It's worth noting that Emden was the only ship of her class and was designed to comply with the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles and the Allied disarmament commission[1]. Despite these limitations, Emden exceeded the size restrictions like all German warships built during that period[1].
