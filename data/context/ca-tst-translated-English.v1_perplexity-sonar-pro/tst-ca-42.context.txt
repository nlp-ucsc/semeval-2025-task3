Domantas Sabonis played for two Spanish clubs during his youth and early professional career:

1. Unicaja Málaga: Sabonis played for Unicaja Málaga's junior and senior teams[2]. As a teenager, he was part of Unicaja Málaga's youth system and later joined their senior team[1][3]. In the 2013-14 season, at just 17 years old, Sabonis became the youngest Unicaja player to debut in the ACB (the top-tier professional basketball league in Spain)[9].

2. CB Clínicas Rincón Málaga: In the 2012-13 season, Sabonis played for CB Clínicas Rincón Málaga in the Segunda División (Spanish second division)[4].

Sabonis' time in Spain was crucial for his development as a basketball player. He moved to Málaga with his family in 2003 after his father, Arvydas Sabonis, retired from the NBA[8]. This relocation allowed young Domantas to grow up in the Spanish basketball system, which he credits for developing his all-around skills during his crucial teenage years[1].

It's worth noting that despite his success with Unicaja Málaga, Sabonis did not sign a professional contract with the club, as he wanted to preserve his eligibility to play college basketball in the United States[9]. After his time in Spain, he went on to play college basketball for Gonzaga University before entering the NBA draft in 2016.
