Publius Quinctilius Varus died by suicide in September 9 AD during the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest[1][5]. As the Roman forces under his command were being overwhelmed by Germanic tribes led by Arminius, Varus, upon seeing that all hope was lost, took his own life by falling on his sword[1][4].

The battle, which lasted for three days, resulted in a devastating defeat for the Romans. Varus's three legions - the Seventeenth, Eighteenth, and Nineteenth - were ambushed and ultimately destroyed in the heavily forested, swampy terrain that made Roman infantry maneuvers impossible[1]. 

On the third day of fighting, as the Germans overwhelmed the Romans at Kalkriese Hill, north of Osnabr√ºck, Varus realized the totality of the defeat[1]. Rather than face capture and the shame of such a monumental loss, he chose to end his life in the Roman manner by falling on his sword[1][4].

After Varus's death, Arminius, the Germanic leader who had orchestrated the ambush, cut off Varus's head and sent it to Bohemia as a gift to King Marbod of the Marcomanni, in an unsuccessful attempt to form an anti-Roman alliance[1].

The defeat of Varus and the loss of three entire legions had a profound impact on Rome. Emperor Augustus was reportedly so distraught that he would beat his head against a door, shouting "Quinctilius Varus, give me back my legions!"[3] The battle effectively halted Roman expansion beyond the Rhine and is considered one of the most important defeats in Roman history[5].
