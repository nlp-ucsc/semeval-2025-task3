2. Barry Fratelli (born Barry Wallace) - bass guitar and backing vocals[1][4][6]

3. Mince Fratelli (born Gordon McRory) - drums, backing vocals, and occasional banjo[1][4][6]

In addition to the main members, the band has been supported by touring musicians:

4. Will Foster - keyboards and piano (2008–present), and guitar (2008–2009)[1][5]

For their more recent performances and recordings, they have also included:

6. Paul Towndrow - saxophones (2021–present)[1]

7. The Wild Tonics - backing vocals (2021–present)[1]

It's worth noting that the band members use stage names, adopting "Fratelli" as their shared surname, which was inspired by the criminal family in the film "The Goonies"[4]. Despite this, they are not actually related to each other[1].
