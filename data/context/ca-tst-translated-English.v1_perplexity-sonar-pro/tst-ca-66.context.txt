Georges Méliès made the first science fiction movie "Le Voyage dans la Lune" (A Trip to the Moon) in 1902[1][2]. Méliès was a pioneering French filmmaker who wrote, directed, produced, and starred in this groundbreaking 12-minute silent film[1][2].

Some key details about the film and Méliès' role:

1. Méliès played the lead role of Professor Barbenfouillis in addition to his behind-the-scenes work[1].

2. The film was inspired by Jules Verne's novels "From the Earth to the Moon" (1865) and "Around the Moon" (1870)[1].

3. It follows a group of astronomers who travel to the Moon in a cannon-propelled capsule, explore its surface, encounter Selenites (lunar inhabitants), and return to Earth[1][2].

4. Méliès employed innovative special effects techniques he had developed, including stop-motion photography, multiple exposures, and dissolves[1][9].

5. The film is considered the first science fiction movie in cinematic history and remains one of the most iconic and influential early films[2][7].

6. Its most famous scene shows the spacecraft landing in the eye of the Man in the Moon, an image that has become one of the most recognizable in film history[1][9].

7. While hugely popular, Méliès did not receive most of the profits due to widespread film piracy at the time[1].

Méliès' "A Trip to the Moon" laid the groundwork for future science fiction films and showcased the potential of cinema as a medium for storytelling and visual spectacle[2][7].
