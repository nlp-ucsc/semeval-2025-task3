Dame Ethel Smyth was the first English composer to be recognized as a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1922[1][2][3]. This recognition made her the first female composer to be awarded a damehood[4][5].

Ethel Smyth was a trailblazing figure in British music and women's rights. Born in 1858, she defied societal expectations and her father's wishes to pursue a career in music[2]. She studied composition at the Leipzig Conservatory and went on to become a prolific composer of orchestral works, operas, and chamber music[1].

Some of Smyth's notable achievements include:

1. Her debut as a composer of orchestral music with the Serenade in D at the Crystal Palace Concerts[1].
2. Composing six operas between 1892 and 1924, performed at leading houses including Weimar, Leipzig, Covent Garden, and The Metropolitan Opera[1].
3. Writing "The March of Women," which became the anthem of the suffragette movement in Britain[5].

Smyth was not only recognized for her musical contributions but also for her role in the suffragette movement. She was an active member of the Women's Social and Political Union and even spent two months in Holloway Prison for her involvement in the cause[1][3].

Her appointment as Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1922 was a significant milestone, acknowledging her contributions to music and literature[1][2][3]. This recognition helped pave the way for future generations of women in classical music and highlighted the changing attitudes towards women's achievements in the arts.
