Johann Sebastian Bach typically signed his name as "J. S. Bach" or variations thereof. Here are some key details about Bach's signature:

1. Standard signature: Bach most commonly used "J. S. Bach" as his signature on official documents and musical manuscripts[7].

2. Full name usage: On more formal occasions or important documents, he would use his full name "Johann Sebastian Bach"[7].

3. Variations: Depending on the context, Bach sometimes included titles or additional information in his signature. For example, he might add "Capellmeister" (chapel master) or other professional titles to his name[7].

4. Musical signature: While not a literal signature, Bach was known to incorporate his name musically using the BACH motif (B-flat, A, C, B-natural). This sequence of notes spells out B-A-C-H in German musical notation, where B-flat is represented by B and B-natural by H[3][6].

5. Symbolic representation: Bach was aware of the numerical representation of his name. By assigning numbers to the letters of the alphabet (A=1, B=2, etc.), B-A-C-H adds up to 14 (2+1+3+8). Bach sometimes used this number symbolically in his compositions[8].

6. Seal: Bach also used a personal seal, known as the Bach Seal or Bach Monogram, which incorporated his initials JSB in an intricate design. This seal was used on official documents and letters[1].

It's important to note that while Bach used these various forms of signatures and representations of his name, he did not consistently use any one particular signature across all his works and documents. The form of signature often depended on the context and purpose of the document or composition.
