Đặng Thị Ngọc Thịnh became the first female president of Vietnam in 2018[1][4]. She served as acting president from September 21 to October 23, 2018, following the death of President Trần Đại Quang[4][7].

Some key points about Đặng Thị Ngọc Thịnh's historic role:

1. She was elected vice president of Vietnam in April 2016, winning 91.09% of the vote in the National Assembly[1].

2. Upon President Quang's death on September 21, 2018, Thịnh automatically assumed the role of acting president as per Vietnam's constitution[4].

3. This made her the first woman in Vietnamese history to hold the presidency, even if in an acting capacity[1].

4. She was also the first female head of state in a communist country since Soong Ching-ling of China[1].

5. Thịnh served as acting president until the election and swearing-in of Nguyễn Phú Trọng on October 23, 2018[1].

While Thịnh's appointment was historically significant, some activists and observers noted that its impact on women's rights and representation in Vietnam may be limited[6]. The country still faces challenges in terms of gender equality in politics and society, with women underrepresented in high-level government positions[5][6].

It's worth noting that since Thịnh's brief tenure, Vietnam has had other female leaders in high positions. For example, Võ Thị Ánh Xuân served as acting president twice, in 2023 and 2024[8].
