The twin giant Aloadae are called Otus (or Otos) and Ephialtes[1][2][3]. These giants were the sons of Iphimedia and Poseidon in Greek mythology, though they were sometimes referred to as the sons of Aloeus, from which they get their collective name "Aloadae"[3][4].

Otus and Ephialtes were known for their extraordinary size and strength. They grew at an astonishing rate, reportedly increasing by nine fingers every month. By the age of nine, they were said to be nine fathoms (about 54 feet) tall[1][2].

The names of the giants have specific meanings:

1. Otus (Ὦτος) means "insatiate" or can also be translated as "horned owl" or "doom"[1][4].
2. Ephialtes (Ἐφιάλτης) means "nightmare"[1][4].

These twin giants are famous in Greek mythology for their audacious attempt to overthrow the Olympian gods. They planned to stack three mountains (Olympus, Ossa, and Pelion) on top of each other to reach the heavens[1][4]. Their story also includes capturing the god Ares and holding him prisoner for thirteen months[2][3].

The Aloadae met their end on the island of Naxos when they attempted to capture the goddess Artemis. She cleverly tricked them by running between them in the form of a deer, causing the giants to accidentally kill each other with their spears as they tried to hit her[2][3].

Despite their antagonistic role against the gods, some traditions portray the Aloadae in a more positive light. They were credited with founding several cities and were even said to be the first to worship the Muses on Mount Helicon[1][3].
