Based on the search results provided, there is no specific Catalan translation given for the title "Police Academy." The information about translations in different languages is limited, and for Catalan (listed as "Catalan; Valencian" in the results), there is no title or overview provided[1]. The entry for Catalan simply shows a dash ("â€”"), indicating that no translation is available or has been recorded for this language.

It's worth noting that while translations are provided for many other languages, including Spanish, French, and Italian, the Catalan version is not present in the given information. This could mean that either the movie was not officially translated into Catalan, or that the database simply doesn't have this information recorded.

Without additional information, it's not possible to definitively state how "Police Academy" was translated into Catalan, if it was translated at all.
