The bird genus Foudia (fodies) comprises 8 species[1][2]. These small passerine birds belong to the weaver family Ploceidae and are native to islands in the western Indian Ocean[2]. The 8 species of Foudia are:

1. Red fody (Foudia madagascariensis)
2. Comoros fody (Foudia eminentissima)
3. Aldabra fody (Foudia aldabrana)
4. Forest fody (Foudia omissa)
5. Mauritius fody (Foudia rubra)
6. Seychelles fody (Foudia sechellarum)
7. Rodrigues fody (Foudia flavicans)
8. Réunion fody (†Foudia delloni) - extinct species[2]

These birds are typically found in forest, woodland, or scrubland habitats, with some species also adapting to human-modified environments[2]. Fodies are characterized by their small size (12-15 cm long) and short, conical bills[2]. Male fodies in breeding plumage are often brightly colored, featuring red or yellow on their heads and sometimes other parts of their bodies. In contrast, non-breeding males and females have duller, sparrow-like plumage that is predominantly grey-brown[2].

The conservation status of these species varies. While some, like the red fody, are common within their range, others face threats to their survival. For example, the Mauritius fody is classified as endangered, and the Rodrigues fody is considered near threatened[1][5].
