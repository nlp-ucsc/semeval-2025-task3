The municipality of Yushu is located at an average elevation of approximately 4,493 meters (14,741 feet) above sea level[1]. However, it's important to note that the elevation varies across the region:

1. The city seat, known as Jyekundo town or Jiegu, has an altitude of 3,681 meters (12,077 feet) above sea level[1].

2. The overall terrain of Yushu City ranges from a lowest point of 3,350 meters (10,991 feet) to a highest peak of 5,752 meters (18,871 feet) above sea level[1].

3. The majority of the area in Yushu Prefecture, which includes Yushu City, is situated between 4,000 to 5,000 meters (13,123 to 16,404 feet) above sea level[2].

4. There are 951 peaks within Yushu City that exceed 5,000 meters (16,404 feet) in elevation, many of which are snow-covered year-round[1].

This high-altitude location contributes to Yushu's classification as a plateau alpine climate, characterized by long, cold winters and short, cool to warm summers[3]. The significant elevation also impacts the local environment, resulting in unique ecological features and challenges for human habitation.
