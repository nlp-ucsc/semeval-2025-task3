Barry Keoghan won the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor in 2023 for his role in "The Banshees of Inisherin"[3][5][6]. This marked Keoghan's first BAFTA win[3]. The film, directed by Martin McDonagh, was a critical success, winning four BAFTAs in total, including Outstanding British Film and Original Screenplay[3].

Keoghan's performance in "The Banshees of Inisherin" was widely praised, and this BAFTA win was part of a successful awards season for the Irish actor. In addition to the BAFTA, he also received nominations for the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the same role[7].
