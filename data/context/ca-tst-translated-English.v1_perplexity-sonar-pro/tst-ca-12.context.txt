Real Madrid Castilla was originally founded on December 16, 1930 under the name Agrupación Deportiva Plus Ultra[1][2]. 

Some key details about the club's history and name changes:

1. It was initially established as an amateur team called Agrupación Deportiva Plus Ultra in 1930[1].

2. In 1948, AD Plus Ultra agreed to become a feeder club for Real Madrid[3].

3. In 1952, it officially became Real Madrid's reserve team[3].

4. In 1972, when the insurance company Plus Ultra folded, the team was renamed to Castilla Club de Fútbol[3].

5. In 1991, due to regulations by the Royal Spanish Football Federation banning separate names for reserve teams, it became known as Real Madrid Deportiva and then Real Madrid B[3].

6. In 2005, the team revived the Castilla name and became known as Real Madrid Castilla, which remains its current official name[3].

So while the club that eventually became Real Madrid Castilla was founded in 1930 as AD Plus Ultra, it has undergone several name changes over the decades as its relationship with Real Madrid evolved. The Castilla name specifically came into use in 1972, about 42 years after the club's original founding.
