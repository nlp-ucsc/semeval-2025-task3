The captain of a football team is distinguished from other players primarily by wearing an armband[1][3]. This armband is the most visible and official marker of the captain's role on the field.

Beyond this physical distinction, the captain is set apart by their responsibilities and leadership role:

1. Official duties: The captain is the only player with the official responsibility to participate in the coin toss before kick-off and penalty shootouts[1][3].

2. Leadership: The captain serves as the on-pitch leader of the team, often being one of the more experienced or senior members of the squad[1]. They are expected to:

   - Provide a rallying point for the team, boosting morale when needed[1]
   - Act as a mediator between teammates, the manager, and the referee[3]
   - Lead the team out of the dressing room at the start of the match[1]
   - Represent the team in public relations roles[1]

3. Ceremonial duties: The captain usually leads the team to collect medals at award ceremonies and is typically the first to receive and lift any trophies won by the team[1].

4. Dressing room management: Captains are often tasked with running the dressing room and may have input in deciding the starting eleven for games[1].

5. Bridge between players and management: The captain holds the unique position of bridging the gap between players and management, acting as a role model and reinforcing team culture[2].

While these responsibilities set the captain apart, it's important to note that their authority is largely informal. Contrary to common belief, captains have no special authority under the Laws of the Game to challenge referee decisions[1]. Their influence comes from their leadership qualities and the respect they command from their teammates rather than from any official powers.
