Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi, commonly known as HJK Helsinki or simply HJK, was founded on June 19, 1907[1][2][3]. The club was established by Fredrik Wath√©n, with the founding meeting held at a bowling alley in Kaisaniemi Park in Helsinki, Finland[2][3]. This makes HJK one of the oldest and most storied football clubs in Finland, with a rich history spanning over a century.

Since its inception, HJK has grown to become Finland's most successful football club, winning numerous domestic titles and representing the country in European competitions. The club has spent most of its history in the top tier of Finnish football and has played a significant role in shaping the landscape of Finnish soccer[1][3].
