The Mutoscope was invented by Herman Casler in collaboration with W.K.L. Dickson in 1894-1895[1][2][3]. Here are the key details about the invention of the Mutoscope:

Herman Casler was the primary inventor who submitted the patent for the Mutoscope on November 21, 1894[3]. He was granted U.S. patent 549309A for the device on November 5, 1895[2].

W.K.L. Dickson, a former associate of Thomas Edison, worked closely with Casler on developing the Mutoscope[3]. While Casler is credited as the main inventor, Dickson provided important input based on his experience working on motion picture devices with Edison.

The Mutoscope was developed as an alternative to Edison's Kinetoscope[3]. Casler and Dickson aimed to create a simpler, less expensive device that would avoid infringing on Edison's patents.

The invention emerged from a collaboration between four key individuals:
1. Herman Casler
2. W.K.L. Dickson 
3. Elias Koopman
4. Harry Marvin

These four men founded the American Mutoscope Company in 1895 to commercialize the invention[1][4]. The company was later renamed American Mutoscope and Biograph Company in 1899[2].

The Mutoscope utilized a "flipbook" style mechanism, with hundreds of sequential photograph cards mounted on a circular core[1]. This design was inspired by earlier flipbooks but applied the principle on a larger scale for coin-operated viewing.

Casler developed the initial prototype in 1894, and by 1895 had successfully tested it with film[4]. The device quickly gained popularity and dominated the coin-operated peepshow market, outcompeting Edison's Kinetoscope[1][2].

In summary, while Herman Casler is officially credited as the inventor who patented the Mutoscope, its development involved significant collaboration, particularly with W.K.L. Dickson. The invention emerged from their efforts to create an alternative to Edison's motion picture devices in the mid-1890s.
