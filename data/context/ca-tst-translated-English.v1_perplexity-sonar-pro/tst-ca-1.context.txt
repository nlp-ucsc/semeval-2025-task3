Kaspiysk is located on the shore of the Caspian Sea[1][3]. It is a city in the Republic of Dagestan, Russia, situated 18 kilometers southeast of Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan[1][3].

The Caspian Sea is the world's largest inland body of water, often described as the largest lake or referred to as a sea[5]. It is an endorheic basin, meaning it has no outflows, and is bounded by several countries:

- Kazakhstan to the northeast
- Russia to the northwest
- Azerbaijan to the southwest
- Iran to the south
- Turkmenistan to the southeast[5]

Kaspiysk's location on the Caspian Sea is significant for several reasons:

1. Strategic importance: The city is home to a large naval storage facility and machine-building factories that produce equipment for the Russian Navy[3].

2. Climate advantages: Being located in the central part of the Caspian Sea, Kaspiysk avoids the freezing issues that affect the northern parts of the sea during winter[4].

3. Naval base relocation: The Russian government has been relocating its main Caspian Flotilla base from Astrakhan to Kaspiysk, which will improve the flotilla's operational capabilities[4].

4. Industrial heritage: Kaspiysk was originally built in the 1930s as a worker's settlement for a naval diesel engine manufacturer, reflecting its long-standing connection to maritime industries[3].

The city's name itself is derived from its location, with "Kaspiy" referring to the Caspian Sea[3]. This positioning has shaped Kaspiysk's development and continues to influence its role in Russia's naval and industrial strategies in the region.
