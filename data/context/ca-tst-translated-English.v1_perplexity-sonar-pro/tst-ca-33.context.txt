A fen is a type of wetland ecosystem characterized by several key features:

1. Water Source: Fens are primarily fed by mineral-rich groundwater or surface water, which distinguishes them from bogs that are mainly fed by rainwater[1][3]. This constant inflow of mineral-rich water gives fens a unique water chemistry.

2. Peat Formation: Fens are peat-accumulating wetlands[3]. The near-constant inundation creates anaerobic conditions that limit plant decomposition, leading to peat formation over time[1].

3. pH Levels: Unlike highly acidic bogs, fens typically have a pH above 5, making them only moderately acidic[1][3]. Some definitions specify a pH greater than 6[5].

4. Vegetation: Fens are dominated by grasses, sedges, reeds, and other grasslike plants[1][3]. They may also support shrubs and, in some cases, stunted trees[7].

5. Biodiversity: Fens are highly biodiverse ecosystems, often serving as habitats for rare or endangered species[3].

6. Geographic Distribution: While fens can be found worldwide, they are most common in the mid to high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere[3].

7. Soil Composition: Fen soils typically consist of decomposed sedges or brown moss peat[3].

8. Water Table: The surface of a fen is usually level with the water table, which may fluctuate slightly above or below the surface[3].

In the context of England, The Fens (also known as Fenland) refers to a specific low-lying region in eastern England, covering parts of Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, and Suffolk[2][4]. This area, once a vast marshland, has been largely drained over centuries for agricultural use. Today, it's a flat, fertile region that contains about half of England's grade 1 agricultural land[2][4]. While much of the original wetland has been converted, some areas of natural fen still exist and are protected as nature reserves[4].
