The narrow water passage that separates the islands of Formentera and Ibiza is called Es Pas des Trucadors[1]. This channel is approximately 350 meters wide at its narrowest point and connects the northern tip of Formentera to the southern part of Espalmador, a small island that lies between Formentera and Ibiza[1].

Es Pas des Trucadors is known for its shallow waters and strong currents, which can make crossing it on foot or by swimming dangerous. Despite its relatively short distance, attempting to cross this passage by walking or swimming is prohibited and can be potentially life-threatening due to the unpredictable currents[1].

The passage is part of the larger body of water known as the Balearic Sea, which surrounds the Balearic Islands, including Ibiza and Formentera[4]. While the strait itself is narrow, the overall distance between the main islands of Ibiza and Formentera is about 10 nautical miles (19 km)[2][5], which is typically covered by ferry services that operate frequently between the two islands.
