Pietro Nenni was awarded the Stalin Peace Prize (also known as the International Stalin Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples) in 1951[1][2][4].

Some key details about this award:

1. It was created on December 21, 1949[6].

2. The prize came with a monetary award of $25,000[4].

3. Nenni later returned both the award and the prize money in 1956 as a protest against the Soviet invasion of Hungary[2][4].

4. At the time he received the award, Nenni was the leader of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) and was known for his support of peace and friendship with the USSR[5].

5. The award was part of the Soviet Union's efforts to recognize and support left-wing politicians and intellectuals in Western countries who advocated for policies aligned with Soviet interests[5].

It's worth noting that Nenni's political stance evolved over time. While he was closely aligned with communist positions when he received the Stalin Peace Prize, he later broke with the Italian Communist Party after the events in Hungary in 1956. This shift marked a significant change in his political orientation and in the positioning of the Italian Socialist Party[2][4].
