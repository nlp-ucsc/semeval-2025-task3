Sergei Parajanov died of lung cancer on July 20, 1990 in Yerevan, Armenia[1][4][7]. His health had been seriously weakened by his time in Soviet prisons and labor camps, where he spent several years on various trumped-up charges[1][4]. Specifically, Parajanov had served four years in Russian hard labor camps and nine months in prison in Tbilisi, which took a significant toll on his health[1]. 

In the final months of his life, Parajanov began coughing up blood while working on his autobiographical film "The Confession"[2]. He was diagnosed with lung cancer, and although French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand offered him treatment in Paris, Parajanov was skeptical after his friend Andrei Tarkovsky had died of the same disease despite treatment in France[2]. Parajanov did travel to Paris for treatment, but French medicine was unable to help him[2]. He returned to Yerevan and died the same day at the Republican Hospital[2].

Parajanov's death at age 66 came at a time when, after nearly two decades of suppression by Soviet authorities, his films were finally being featured at international film festivals[1][4]. His passing was mourned by many in the film world, with Federico Fellini, Tonino Guerra, Alberto Moravia, Francesco Rosi, Giulietta Masina, Marcello Mastroianni, and Bernardo Bertolucci writing that "Cinema lost one of its magicians"[6].
