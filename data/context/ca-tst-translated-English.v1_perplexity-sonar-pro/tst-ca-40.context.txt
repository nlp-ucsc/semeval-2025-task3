Magnar Solberg, the Norwegian biathlete, participated in two Olympic events:

1. 20 km Individual: Solberg won gold medals in this event at both the 1968 Grenoble Winter Olympics and the 1972 Sapporo Winter Olympics[1][2]. His victory in 1968 was particularly notable as he achieved a perfect shooting score, something he had never done before in competition[1]. In 1972, he successfully defended his title, becoming the first and only biathlete in Olympic history to win back-to-back gold medals in an individual event[1][3].

2. 4 x 7.5 km Relay: Solberg was part of the Norwegian team that won the silver medal in this event at the 1968 Grenoble Winter Olympics[1][2]. In the 1972 Sapporo Winter Olympics, he again participated in the relay event, where the Norwegian team finished fourth[2].

Solberg's achievements in these events, particularly his consecutive gold medals in the 20 km individual race, have cemented his place in Olympic biathlon history. He also holds the distinction of being the oldest gold medalist in an individual event at the Winter Olympics, having won his second gold at the age of 35 years and 4 days in 1972[1][3].
