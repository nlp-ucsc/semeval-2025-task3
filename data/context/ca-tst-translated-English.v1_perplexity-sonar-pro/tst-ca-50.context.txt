The Battle of Long Island occurred on August 27, 1776[1][2][3]. This battle, also known as the Battle of Brooklyn or the Battle of Brooklyn Heights, was a significant engagement in the American Revolutionary War[1][4]. It was the first major battle to take place after the United States declared its independence on July 4, 1776[1].

The battle was preceded by several key events:

1. On August 22, 1776, British forces under General William Howe began landing troops on Long Island[3][5].

2. By August 26, the British had positioned their forces for the attack[3].

3. The first shots of the battle were fired around 11:00 PM on August 26 near the Red Lion Inn[1].

The main battle unfolded on August 27:

1. Around 1:00 AM, British troops engaged with American forces near the Red Lion Inn[1].

2. At dawn, the British launched their main assault, which included a flanking maneuver through the unguarded Jamaica Pass[4][5].

3. Fighting continued throughout the morning, with the bloodiest engagements occurring near Battle Pass[3].

4. By early afternoon, General Howe had halted the fighting, and the Americans were in retreat[6].

The battle resulted in a decisive British victory, forcing the Continental Army to evacuate their positions on Long Island. However, on the night of August 29-30, General Washington successfully orchestrated a retreat of his remaining forces to Manhattan, avoiding complete destruction of his army[1][6].
