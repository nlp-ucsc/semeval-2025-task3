Emperor Uda was the 59th emperor of Japan[1][4][10]. He reigned from 887 to 897 CE[1][3]. Emperor Uda's full name was Uda Tennō, and his personal name before ascending to the throne was Sadami[1][4]. 

Born on May 5, 867 in Kyoto, Japan, Uda was the third son of Emperor Kōkō[1][4]. His mother was Empress Dowager Hanshi, who was notably not a member of the powerful Fujiwara family that dominated Japanese politics at the time[1][4].

Emperor Uda ascended to the Chrysanthemum Throne at the young age of 21 in 887 CE[3]. During his 10-year reign, he made efforts to reduce the influence of the Fujiwara family on imperial affairs, particularly after the death of Fujiwara no Mototsune in 891[1]. Uda abdicated in 897 in favor of his eldest son, who became Emperor Daigo, but continued to exercise influence as a retired emperor[1].
