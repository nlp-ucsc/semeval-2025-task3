The Jomsvikings were adherents of Norse paganism, dedicated to the worship of the Old Norse gods like Odin and Thor[1][3][5]. They were staunchly pagan and known for their devotion to the "old ways" of Norse religion[4][5].

Some key points about the Jomsvikings' religious beliefs:

1. They were loyal to the cult of Odin and Thor, the major Norse deities[5].

2. The Jomsvikings were described as "staunchly dedicated to the worship of the Old Norse gods"[3].

3. They were seen as defenders of the pagan Norse faith, especially as Christianity began spreading in Scandinavia[4].

4. Their belief system centered on rewards in the afterlife (like Valhalla) for those who died in battle, which justified their warrior lifestyle[2].

5. They were active during the 10th-11th centuries, a time when Norse paganism was still prevalent but Christianity was beginning to spread in Scandinavia[1][5].

Interestingly, despite their pagan beliefs, the Jomsvikings were known to fight for Christian lords if the pay was good enough[3][5]. This suggests that while they were devoted to their pagan faith, they were also pragmatic mercenaries.

It's worth noting that the historical existence of the Jomsvikings is debated among scholars, with some considering them more legendary than factual[1][3]. However, the sagas and stories about them consistently portray them as adherents of Norse paganism.
