John Travolta plays the role of Brigadier General Quintard in the 1998 war film "The Thin Red Line"[5][8]. His character appears briefly early in the film as a high-ranking military officer[10].

Specifically:

1. Travolta's character Brig. Gen. Quintard is described as the highest ranking character shown in the movie[9].

2. It's a small role, essentially a cameo appearance rather than a major supporting part[10]. 

3. Travolta appears early in the film to give orders to Lt. Col. Tall (played by Nick Nolte)[6].

4. His performance is characterized as portraying the character's theatricality and "showy bigness"[10].

5. Travolta's Quintard is described as speaking very loudly, in contrast to the generally more subdued tone of the film[10].

6. He wears a notably distracting mustache for the role[10].

7. After his brief appearance, Travolta's character does not return for the rest of the film[10].

While Travolta is part of the star-studded ensemble cast, his role is quite limited in screen time and importance to the overall story compared to some of the other well-known actors featured in the film[1][2].
