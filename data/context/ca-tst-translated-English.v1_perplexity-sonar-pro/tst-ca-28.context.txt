The Great Crested Grebe (Podiceps cristatus) primarily feeds on fish, with a diet that also includes other aquatic organisms. Here are the key details about its feeding habits:

## Main Diet Components

1. Fish: Large fish make up the predominant part of the Great Crested Grebe's diet[1][3][6]. Some of their favored fish species include:
   - Roach (Rutilus rutilus)
   - Perch (Perca fluviatilis)
   - Smelt (Osmerus eperlanus)[1]

2. Other Aquatic Prey: While fish are the main food source, the grebe's diet also consists of:
   - Insects
   - Crustaceans (e.g., crayfish, shrimps)
   - Molluscs
   - Adult and larval amphibians
   - Invertebrate larvae[1][6][9]

## Feeding Behavior

Great Crested Grebes are expert divers and catch their prey primarily by diving underwater[1][4]. They typically:

- Forage most actively during dawn and dusk, when prey is closer to the surface
- Can dive to depths of up to 6 meters, with some records showing maximum depths of up to 40 meters[7]
- Usually dive for no longer than 30 seconds at a time[7]

## Dietary Adaptations

1. Feather Ingestion: Great Crested Grebes have been observed swallowing their own feathers. This behavior is thought to protect their digestive system from sharp fish bones[4].

2. Seasonal Variations: Their invertebrate consumption tends to be highest during the breeding season[9].

3. Flexibility: The species can adapt its diet based on the most abundant fish species in its habitat. For example, studies have shown that they may feed primarily on species like bleak, roach, and perch when these are numerous[10].

In summary, while the Great Crested Grebe is a versatile predator capable of consuming a variety of aquatic organisms, large fish form the core of its diet, supplemented by smaller aquatic creatures depending on availability and seasonal factors.
