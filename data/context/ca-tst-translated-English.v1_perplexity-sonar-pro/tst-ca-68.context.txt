The Pontifical Gregorian University was founded by Saint Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), on February 18, 1551[1][4][6][7]. Ignatius, together with a small group of Jesuits, established a school in Rome that was initially called the Roman College (Collegio Romano)[1][3]. 

This institution began as a "School of Grammar, Humanities, and Christian Doctrine" (Scuola di grammatica, d'umanit√† e di Dottrina cristiana) and was located at the base of the Capitoline Hill[1]. The school was provided financial support by Francis Borgia, the viceroy of Catalonia and a Catholic patron[1].

It's important to note that while Saint Ignatius of Loyola is credited as the primary founder, he was assisted by other Jesuits in this endeavor[4][7]. The school was established with the aim of providing free education, which aligned with the Jesuit mission of serving the Church and society through education[6].

In its early years, the institution was known simply as the Roman College. It wasn't until later, in 1584, that it was renamed the Gregorian University in honor of Pope Gregory XIII, who had provided the college with a new, larger home[1]. However, despite this later renaming, the founding date of 1551 and Ignatius of Loyola's role as the founder remain central to the university's history.
