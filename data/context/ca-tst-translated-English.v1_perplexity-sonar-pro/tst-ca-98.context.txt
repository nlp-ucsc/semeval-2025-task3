The Danish Golden Age, which spanned roughly from 1801 to 1864, saw the emergence of several prominent artists who made significant contributions to Danish art. Some of the key artists of this period include:

1. Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg: Often referred to as the "father of Danish painting," Eckersberg was a highly influential professor at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts[1][6]. He emphasized painting "truthfully and beautifully" and introduced studies of the female nude[3].

2. Christen Købke: Considered one of the greatest painters of the Danish Golden Age, Købke was known for his intimate portraits and poetic depictions of Copenhagen and its surroundings[2][3].

3. Johan Thomas Lundbye: Lundbye specialized in landscape painting and was known for his detailed animal studies, particularly of cows[6].

4. Martinus Rørbye: A student of Eckersberg, Rørbye was particularly interested in depicting everyday life on the streets of Copenhagen[6].

5. Wilhelm Marstrand: Marstrand painted genre scenes, portraits, and everyday life in Copenhagen[6].

6. Constantin Hansen: Initially focused on portrait painting, Hansen later developed a keen interest in architectural painting under Eckersberg's influence[6].

7. Peter Christian Skovgaard: Known for his ability to capture the magnificence and idyllic beauty of Danish nature[6].

Other notable artists of the period included:

- Wilhelm Bendz
- Lorenz Frølich
- Louis Gurlitt
- Vilhelm Kyhn
- L.A. Smith

The Danish Golden Age artists were characterized by their focus on national themes, precise observation of nature, and a blend of Romantic and Realist styles. They often painted landscapes, cityscapes, portraits, and scenes of everyday life, contributing to a distinctive national approach to painting in Denmark[1][2][5].

These artists played a crucial role in rebuilding Denmark's national identity during a time of political and economic crises, creating some of the most important works in Danish art history[6].
