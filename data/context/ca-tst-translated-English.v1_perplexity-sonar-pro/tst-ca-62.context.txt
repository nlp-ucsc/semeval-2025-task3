PJAK stands for "Party for a Free Life in Kurdistan" or "Kurdistan Free Life Party"[1][4]. This is an Iranian Kurdish militant and political organization founded in 2004[1]. 

Some key points about PJAK:

1. Full name variations: The group is also known by other similar names, including:
   - Party of Free Life of Kurdistan
   - Free Life Party of Kurdistan
   - Parti Jiyani Azadi Kurdistan
   - Partiya Jiyana Azad A Kurdistane[1]

2. Origins: PJAK was established in 2004 in Iraq, though some accounts suggest it may have roots in Iran dating back to the late 1990s[1][3].

3. Affiliation: It is considered a branch or offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which primarily operates in Turkey[1][3].

4. Goals: PJAK advocates for:
   - Kurdish autonomy and rights
   - Establishment of a secular and democratic political system in Iran
   - Greater gender equality
   - A federalized Iran with substantial Kurdish autonomy[1][2]

5. Structure: The group has both a political wing and a military wing, known as the East Kurdistan Defense Forces[1].

6. Size and location: PJAK is estimated to have around 3,000 members, primarily based in the Qandil mountains of northern Iraq[1][7].

7. International status: In 2009, the United States Department of Treasury designated PJAK as a terrorist organization, citing its affiliation with the PKK[1].

PJAK presents itself as more than just a Kurdish nationalist organization, claiming to stand for all of Iran's ethnic and religious minorities in pursuit of a more inclusive and democratic Iran[4].
