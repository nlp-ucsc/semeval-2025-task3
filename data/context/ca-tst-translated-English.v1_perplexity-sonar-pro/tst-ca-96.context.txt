The Sweet Chestnut tree (Castanea sativa) is known by several other names:

1. European Chestnut[4]
2. Spanish Chestnut[1][3]
3. Portuguese Chestnut[1]
4. Marron (French for "chestnut")[1][3]

Additionally, the tree has specific names in different languages:

- Latin name: Castanea sativa[1][3][4]
- Welsh name: Castanwydden Felys[1]
- French: ch√¢taignier commun[9]
- German: Edelkastanie[9]
- Italian: castagno[9]

It's worth noting that the Sweet Chestnut is often distinguished from the Horse Chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum), which is a different species altogether[1][7]. The Sweet Chestnut is part of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches[7].

The scientific name Castanea sativa has its own etymology:
- Castanea comes from Castonis, a town in Thessaly, Greece, where the tree was grown for its nuts[1][7].
- Sativa is based on the Latin word satus, meaning 'sown', implying that the tree has been cultivated by humans[1].
