The technique opposite to collage that involves constructing an image by tearing or removing parts of the original is called décollage[2][8].

Décollage is essentially the inverse process of collage. While collage involves building up an image by assembling and adhering various materials, décollage creates art by cutting, tearing away, or otherwise removing pieces from an existing image or surface[2][8].

Some key points about décollage:

1. Origin: The term "décollage" comes from the French word meaning "to become unglued" or "to take off"[2].

2. Process: It typically involves starting with an existing image or layered materials and then selectively removing or tearing away portions to create a new composition[8].

3. Materials: Common materials used include posters, advertisements, or other printed media that can be torn or cut[8].

4. Historical context: The technique gained prominence in the mid-20th century, particularly with the Nouveau Réalisme movement in France[6].

5. Notable practitioners: Artists like Jacques Villeglé were known for creating décollages from layers of torn street posters[6].

6. Contrast with collage: While collage is an additive process, décollage is subtractive, revealing underlying layers or creating new forms through removal[2][8].

Décollage can produce intriguing visual effects by exposing hidden layers, creating textural interest, and juxtaposing fragments of imagery in unexpected ways. It's a technique that challenges the viewer's perception and can result in complex, multi-layered artworks.
