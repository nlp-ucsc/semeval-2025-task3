The Alemanni were a confederation of Germanic tribes that united several smaller groups. Based on the search results, the following tribes were part of or associated with the Alemanni confederation:

1. Bucinobantes: This tribe is specifically mentioned as one of the largest tribes within the Alemanni confederation[3].

2. Hermunduri: Though not definitively stated, it's likely that remnants of this tribe were absorbed into the Alemanni after being broken during the Marcomannic Wars[3].

3. Semnones: Another tribe that was probably part of the larger Alemanni confederation[3].

4. Suebi (or Suevi): The Alemanni were considered part of the broader Suebian confederation. In fact, to the Alemanni themselves, their name was interchangeable with the Suebi name[3].

5. Juthungi: While not explicitly mentioned in the search results, historical sources often associate this tribe with the Alemanni.

It's important to note that the Alemanni were not a single, homogeneous people but rather a confederation of various Germanic tribes[1][3][5]. Their very name, meaning "all men" or "men united," reflects this diverse composition[5]. The confederation likely included fragments of several other Germanic peoples whose individual names may have been lost to history[10].

The Alemanni emerged as a distinct group in the 3rd century CE, formed from various smaller Germanic tribes that had been migrating southwards[3][4]. Over time, they settled in regions that now include parts of southwestern Germany, northern Switzerland, and the Alsace region of France[1][3].

While these tribes united under the Alemanni banner, it's worth noting that until at least the sixth century, each tribe in the confederation likely maintained a degree of self-governance, possibly with an over-king providing military leadership during times of conflict[3].
