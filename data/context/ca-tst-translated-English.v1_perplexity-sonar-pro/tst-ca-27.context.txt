The name Favara originates from Arabic and has an interesting etymology related to water sources. Specifically:

The name Favara derives from the Arabic word "fawwāra" (فوارة), meaning "spring" or "fountain"[1][2]. This Arabic origin reflects the historical Muslim presence in Sicily during the medieval period.

The name evolved over time:

1. It started as "Rohal-Fewwar" in Arabic, meaning "spring of water" or "large quantity of water"[1].

2. Later, it changed to "Fabaria"[1].

3. Finally, it became "Favara"[1].

The town's name thus refers to the presence of water sources in the area, which was likely an important feature for early settlements. This etymology connects Favara to its geographical characteristics and highlights the linguistic influences of different cultures that ruled Sicily over the centuries.

The connection to water is further supported by the fact that several places in Sicily named Favara are associated with springs or water sources[2]. This suggests that the name was commonly used to designate locations with abundant water, a crucial resource in the Mediterranean climate.
