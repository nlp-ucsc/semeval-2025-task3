Alfred Plé won the bronze medal in rowing at the 1920 Summer Olympics held in Antwerp, Belgium[1][5]. Specifically, Plé competed in the double sculls event alongside his partner Gaston Giran[1]. They finished third, earning the bronze medal with a time of 7:21.0[5][6].

The gold medal in that event was won by the American pair of Paul Costello and John B. Kelly Sr., while the silver went to the Italian duo of Pietro Annoni and Erminio Dones[2]. Plé and Giran's bronze medal performance was notable, as they had also won the European Championship in double sculls that same year[3].

This Olympic Games marked a return to international competition after World War I, with rowing events taking place from August 27-29, 1920 on the Willebroekse Vaart in Vilvoorde[2][3]. For Plé, it was a significant achievement in his rowing career, representing France and his club Société Nautique de la Marne from Joinville-le-Pont[1].
