F.E.A.R. stands for First Encounter Assault Recon[1][3]. It is the name of a fictional elite unit in the United States Army tasked with investigating supernatural phenomena in the game's universe[1]. The game is set in 2025 and follows this special forces team as they deal with paranormal threats to national security[1].

F.E.A.R. is a first-person shooter psychological horror video game series created by Craig Hubbard in 2005[3]. The original game and its sequels blend intense action gameplay with horror elements, featuring a slow-motion mechanic called "reflex time" that allows players to react with superhuman speed during combat encounters[1][3].

The F.E.A.R. team in the game is deployed to handle situations involving paranormal activity that are beyond the capabilities of conventional military forces. In the first game's plot, they are sent to investigate and neutralize a psychic operative named Paxton Fettel who has gone rogue and taken control of an army of clone soldiers[1].
