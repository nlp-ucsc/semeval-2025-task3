Kalervo Rauhala won the silver medal in Greco-Roman wrestling at the 1952 Summer Olympics held in Helsinki, Finland[1][3]. He competed in the middleweight division (≤79 kilograms) and secured the second place, earning the silver medal for Finland[3]. 

In the final round, Rauhala faced Axel Grönberg of Sweden, who ultimately won the gold medal. The Soviet wrestler Nikolay Belov took the bronze medal in this event[3]. 

Rauhala's achievement at the 1952 Olympics was a significant accomplishment in his wrestling career. He went on to win a bronze medal in the Greco-Roman middleweight category at the 1953 World Championships, further solidifying his status as a top wrestler of his time[1].

It's worth noting that the 1952 Helsinki Olympics were particularly special for Finland, as it was the first time the country hosted the Summer Olympic Games. Rauhala's silver medal contributed to Finland's overall medal count in their home Olympics, making it a memorable event for both the athlete and the nation.
