The human eye socket, also known as the orbit, is formed by seven distinct bones. These bones work together to create a protective cavity that houses the eyeball and its associated structures. The seven bones that form the eye socket are:

1. Frontal bone[1][5][6][7][8]
2. Sphenoid bone[1][5][6][7][8]
3. Zygomatic bone (also called the cheekbone)[1][5][6][7][8]
4. Ethmoid bone[1][5][6][7][8]
5. Lacrimal bone[1][5][6][7][8]
6. Maxilla (maxillary bone)[1][5][6][7][8]
7. Palatine bone[1][5][6][7][8]

These bones are arranged in a specific configuration to form the walls, roof, and floor of the orbit:

## Walls of the Orbit

1. Medial wall: Formed by the maxilla, lacrimal bone, ethmoid bone, and sphenoid bone[3][6].

2. Lateral wall: Composed of the zygomatic bone and the greater wing of the sphenoid bone[2].

3. Roof (superior wall): Formed by the frontal bone and the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone[2][6].

4. Floor (inferior wall): Made up of the maxilla, palatine bone, and the orbital plate of the zygomatic bone[6].

The orbit has a pyramidal shape, with the apex pointing posteriorly towards the center of the skull and the base opening anteriorly onto the face[1][2]. This structure provides mechanical protection for the eye and its related soft tissues[3].

## Additional Features

- The orbit has a volume of approximately 30 cubic centimeters (about the size of a golf ball)[5][6].
- The orbital margin, or rim, is formed by different parts of these bones, creating a quadrilateral shape[2][6].
- Several openings in the orbital bones allow for the passage of important structures such as nerves, blood vessels, and the optic canal[2][5].

This complex arrangement of bones not only protects the eye but also provides attachment points for various muscles and structures essential for eye movement and function[6].
