Theano belonged to the Pythagorean school of philosophy[6][9]. Here are some key details about Theano and her association with the Pythagorean school:

1. Time period: Theano was a 6th-century BC philosopher, making her one of the earliest known female philosophers in ancient Greece[6].

2. Relationship to Pythagoras: There are conflicting accounts about Theano's exact relationship to Pythagoras. Some sources describe her as Pythagoras' wife, while others consider her to be his student[6]. Some accounts also suggest she may have been the wife of Brontinus, another Pythagorean philosopher[6].

3. Role in the Pythagorean society: Theano was a prominent member of the Pythagorean secret society, which was dedicated to the study of philosophy and mathematics[9]. She was considered one of the brightest disciples within this group[9].

4. Contributions: Several treatises in mathematics, physics, and medicine are attributed to Theano, including work on the Golden Section (the number Î¦)[9]. However, due to the secretive nature of the Pythagorean society and the practice of attributing works to multiple authors, it's difficult to definitively ascribe specific works to her[9].

5. Leadership: After Pythagoras' death, some accounts suggest that Theano took charge of the Pythagorean order, helping to spread mathematical knowledge and Pythagorean wisdom and doctrines with the assistance of her children and other members[9].

6. Historical significance: Theano is often considered the first known woman mathematician in history[9]. Her involvement in the Pythagorean school also makes her one of the earliest examples of women participating in formal philosophical and mathematical education in ancient Greece.

It's important to note that due to the scarcity and sometimes contradictory nature of ancient sources, some details about Theano's life and work remain uncertain. However, her association with the Pythagorean school is well-established in historical accounts.
