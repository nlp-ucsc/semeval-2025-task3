The deepest cave on Earth is Veryovkina Cave, located in Abkhazia, a disputed region of Georgia[1][2][5]. Here are some key details about this remarkable cave:

1. Depth: Veryovkina Cave reaches a depth of 2,212 meters (7,257 feet)[5]. This makes it the deepest known cave in the world, surpassing the previous record holder, Krubera-Voronja Cave.

2. Location: The cave is situated in the Arabika Massif, part of the Gagra mountain range in the Western Caucasus[1]. Its entrance is 2,285 meters (7,497 ft) above sea level.

3. Discovery and exploration: The cave was first discovered in 1968 by Soviet speleologists, but its true depth was only confirmed in recent years[7]. In August 2017, explorers reached a depth of 2,204 meters, setting a new world depth record[1].

4. Physical characteristics: The cave entrance has a cross-section of 3 m × 4 m (9.8 ft × 13.1 ft), with an entrance shaft 32 meters (105 ft) deep[1]. It features over 30 rock formations, including canyons, sinkholes, and sheer mountain walls[3].

5. Exploration challenges: Like many deep caves, exploring Veryovkina is extremely challenging and requires specialized equipment and training. The cave's environment is harsh, with low temperatures, high humidity, and the constant risk of flooding.

It's worth noting that the Arabika Massif, where Veryovkina Cave is located, is home to several of the world's deepest caves. This includes the former record holder, Krubera-Voronja Cave, which is now the second deepest at 2,199 meters (7,214 feet)[2][5].
