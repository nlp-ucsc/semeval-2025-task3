Cedric Liddell practiced rowing[1][2]. He was a Canadian rower who competed in the 1932 and 1936 Summer Olympics[1]. At the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, Liddell won a bronze medal as a member of the Canadian boat in the men's eights competition[1][3]. 

Liddell was part of the Hamilton Leander Boat Club's 1932 Men's Heavy Eights Olympic rowing team[4]. This team caused a stir by winning the Olympic Trials on July 19, 1932, beating the favored Argonaut crew just 11 days before the opening ceremonies of the Los Angeles Olympics[4]. At the Olympics, Liddell and his teammates (Albert Taylor, Donald Boal, William Thorburn, Harry Fry, Stanley Stanyar, Joe Harris, Earl Eastwood, and coxswain Les MacDonald) went on to win the bronze medal in the eights event[4].

Liddell's Olympic career continued in 1936 when he again competed in the eights competition at the Berlin Olympics[1][2].
