The band name Kaiser Chiefs refers to the South African football club Kaizer Chiefs[1][2]. The English rock band chose this name as a tribute to Lucas Radebe, a former captain of Leeds United Football Club[1][3]. 

Radebe, who was from South Africa, had previously played for the Kaizer Chiefs before joining Leeds United. The band members, being ardent fans of Leeds United, decided to name their group after Radebe's former team[3]. However, they deliberately misspelled "Kaizer" as "Kaiser" in their band name[1].

This name choice came after the band rebranded themselves. They were originally known as Parva from 2000 to 2003, but after facing some setbacks, they decided to change their image and name[1]. The transition to Kaiser Chiefs marked a fresh start for the group, coinciding with a shift in their musical style and overall presentation[1].
