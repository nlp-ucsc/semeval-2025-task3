Gordon Strachan started his professional football career with Dundee[1][2]. He made his senior debut for Dundee in 1974 at the age of 17[1]. Strachan spent four seasons with Dundee, playing a total of 89 matches and scoring 15 goals across all competitions before moving to Aberdeen in 1977[1][3].

During his time at Dundee, Strachan quickly established himself as a talented young player. In the 1975-76 season, which was the inaugural season of the Scottish Premier Division, he featured in 23 league matches for the club[1]. Despite his contributions, Dundee were relegated on the last day of that season[1].

Strachan's performances at Dundee caught the attention of bigger clubs, and he had actually rejected an approach from Manchester United earlier in his youth, believing he had a better chance to establish himself in the first team at Dens Park (Dundee's home ground)[1]. This decision proved wise, as it allowed him to gain valuable first-team experience at a young age, setting the foundation for his successful career in football.
