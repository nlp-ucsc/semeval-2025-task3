Abd al-Rahman Aref (also known as Abdul Rahman Arif) served as President of Iraq from April 16, 1966 to July 17, 1968[1][3][4].

Some key details about his presidency:

1. He came to power following the sudden death of his brother, President Abdul Salam Arif, who died in a helicopter crash on April 13, 1966[1][3].

2. Abd al-Rahman Aref was chosen as president by the Iraqi military after a brief 3-day interim presidency by Abd al-Rahman al-Bazzaz[4].

3. His presidency lasted for 2 years and 92 days[4].

4. Aref's rule was characterized as indecisive and weak, marred by political instability and economic difficulties[1][3].

5. He attempted to continue his brother's policies of modernizing Iraq and balancing relations with both Eastern and Western blocs during the Cold War[3].

6. On July 17, 1968, Aref was deposed in a bloodless coup led by the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, organized by Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr and Saddam Hussein[1][3][4].

7. Following his overthrow, Aref went into exile, first to London and then to Turkey, before being allowed to return to Iraq in 1988 under Saddam Hussein's regime[1].

Aref's presidency was relatively short and ended the pre-Ba'ath Party era of the Iraqi Republic, leading to the long period of Ba'athist rule in Iraq[4].
