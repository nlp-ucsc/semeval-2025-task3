Guillaume Budé was known by the Latinized form of his name, Guilielmus Budaeus[1][3]. This Latin version of his name was commonly used in scholarly circles during the Renaissance period, when it was customary for intellectuals and humanists to adopt Latinized names.

Budé, a prominent French Renaissance humanist and scholar, lived from 1467 to 1540[1][2]. He was renowned for his extensive knowledge of ancient law, Greek language, and classical literature. His Latin name reflects the scholarly tradition of the time, where Latin was the lingua franca of academic and intellectual discourse across Europe.

The use of Latinized names was a common practice among Renaissance humanists, as it connected them to the classical tradition they sought to revive and study. For Budé, who was deeply involved in the revival of Greek studies in France and played a crucial role in establishing institutions like the Collège de France, the Latin form of his name underscored his position as a leading figure in the humanist movement.
