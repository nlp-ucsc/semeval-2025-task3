The modern pentathlon consists of five combined disciplines:

1. Fencing: Athletes compete in a round-robin tournament using épée-style fencing. This includes a ranking round where each athlete faces every other competitor in one-touch bouts lasting one minute, followed by a bonus round with single-elimination bouts lasting 45 seconds[1][2].

2. Swimming: A 200m freestyle swimming event where athletes are seeded into heats based on their world rankings[1][2].

3. Riding (Equestrian): Show jumping on an unfamiliar horse, which the athlete is given just 20 minutes to get acquainted with before competing. The course features 15 jumps over 12 obstacles, with a maximum height of 1.2 meters (4 feet)[1][2].

4. Shooting: Part of the combined laser-run event. Athletes use laser pistols to shoot at electronic targets from a distance of 10 meters[1][2][4].

5. Running: Also part of the combined laser-run event. Athletes run a total distance of 3200m, alternating between running and shooting[1][2][4].

The final two disciplines (shooting and running) are combined into a single event called the laser-run. In this event, athletes alternate between running and shooting, with four shooting stops throughout the 3200m course. At each stop, they must hit five targets before continuing[1][4].

It's worth noting that after the 2024 Paris Olympics, the equestrian discipline will be replaced by an obstacle course race, marking a significant change in the sport's format for future Olympic Games[3][6].
