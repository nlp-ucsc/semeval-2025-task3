Omega Centauri is located approximately 17,000 light-years away from Earth[1][4]. More precisely:

- Some sources estimate the distance at about 16,000 light-years[2].
- Others give a more specific figure of 17,090 light-years (5,240 parsecs)[1].
- The European Space Agency (ESA) states the distance as 17,700 light-years[4].

This massive globular cluster is one of the few visible to the naked eye from Earth, despite its considerable distance[2]. It appears almost as large as the full Moon when viewed from a dark rural area, which is remarkable given its vast distance from us[4].

Omega Centauri's visibility and apparent size are due to its enormous actual size and brightness. It is the largest known globular cluster in the Milky Way, with a diameter of roughly 150 light-years[1]. The cluster contains approximately 10 million stars, with a total mass estimated at 4 million solar masses[1][2].

Its location just above the plane of the Milky Way also contributes to its visibility from Earth, particularly for observers in the southern hemisphere and lower northern latitudes[4].
