The Rammelsberg mines were a significant source of various metals and minerals over their long operational history. The main materials mined at Rammelsberg included:

1. Zinc: The deposit contained high-grade zinc ore, with an average zinc content of 14-19%[1][2][3].

2. Lead: Lead ore was another major product, with lead content ranging from 6-9%[1][2][3].

3. Copper: Copper ore was mined, with copper content around 1-2%[1][2][3].

4. Silver: The ore contained significant amounts of silver, with grades of 140-160 g/t reported[1][2][3].

5. Gold: Small amounts of gold were present, with grades of 0.5-1 g/t mentioned[1][3].

6. Barite: The deposit also contained substantial amounts of barite (barium sulfate), with some sources reporting up to 20% barite content[3].

The Rammelsberg deposit was particularly notable for its high-grade polymetallic ore. It contained a complex mixture of sulfide minerals, including:

- Sphalerite (zinc sulfide)
- Galena (lead sulfide)
- Chalcopyrite (copper iron sulfide)
- Pyrite (iron sulfide)[1][2]

The deposit was classified as a sedimentary exhalative (SEDEX) type, formed by the precipitation of metals from hydrothermal fluids on the ancient seafloor[1][5]. This resulted in massive sulfide lenses interbedded with sedimentary rocks.

Mining at Rammelsberg began as early as the Bronze Age, with a focus on copper and silver initially. Over time, as technologies and market demands changed, the focus shifted to include lead, zinc, and other minerals[2][5]. The mine operated almost continuously for over 1000 years, from at least 968 AD until its closure in 1988, making it one of the longest-operating mines in history[1][2][3].
