I apologize, but I do not have enough information to determine the annual median tax income per person in 2009 specifically for Herpy-l'Arlésienne. The search results do not provide any data about income or taxes for this particular location. Herpy-l'Arlésienne appears to be a small commune in France, and detailed income statistics for such a specific area are not available in the given information. To obtain this kind of localized data, one would likely need to consult French government statistical sources or local economic reports for the Champagne-Ardenne region, which are not provided in the current search results.
