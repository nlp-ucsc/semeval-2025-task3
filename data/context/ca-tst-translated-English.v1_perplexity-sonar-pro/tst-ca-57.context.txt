A retronym is a newer term created to distinguish the original or older version of something from a more recent version or variant[1][2]. This linguistic device becomes necessary when technological advancements or cultural changes create a need to differentiate between the original form and newer iterations of an object, concept, or practice.

Here are some key points about retronyms:

1. Etymology: The term "retronym" was coined by Frank Mankiewicz in 1980 and popularized by William Safire in The New York Times Magazine[1].

2. Function: Retronyms are used to avoid confusion between older and newer versions of things that share the same basic name[1][3].

3. Formation: Typically, a retronym is created by adding a modifying word (usually an adjective) to an existing term[4].

4. Common causes: Technological advancements and evolving social circumstances often necessitate the creation of retronyms[4].

Examples of retronyms include:

- Acoustic guitar (to distinguish from electric guitar)[6]
- Analog clock (to differentiate from digital clock)[6]
- Landline (to contrast with mobile phones)[5]
- Silent film (to distinguish from "talkies" or sound films)[5]
- Snail mail (to differentiate from email)[5]
- Conventional oven (to distinguish from microwave oven)[1]

Retronyms highlight how language adapts to reflect changes in technology and society. They serve as linguistic time capsules, preserving the memory of how things once were while acknowledging the innovations that have since emerged.
