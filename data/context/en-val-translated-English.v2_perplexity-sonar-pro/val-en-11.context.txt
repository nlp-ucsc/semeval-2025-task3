The merger of Takara and Tomy took place on March 1, 2006[1][2]. This merger created the company now known as Takara Tomy (タカラトミー) in Japan and as TOMY internationally[2][5].

Some key details about the merger:

1. The agreement to merge was announced on May 13, 2005[1][3].

2. Tomy was designated as the surviving company in the merger, with Tomy's president Kantaro Tomiyama remaining as president of the new entity[1].

3. Takara's Chairman Keita Sato became the vice president of the merged company[1].

4. The merger ratio was set at 0.178 of a Tomy share for each Takara share[1].

5. Prior to the full merger, the companies established a strategic joint venture called "Takara Tomy Network" on September 1, 2005, to handle media aspects and content[3].

6. The merger combined Japan's second and third-largest toy makers at the time, creating a stronger competitor to Namco Bandai Holdings (which was formed by a merger in September 2005)[1].

7. In deciding the new company name, "Takara" was used for its international brand recognition, while "Tomy" was chosen because it was a trusted brand of infant and preschool products in Japan[2].

This merger brought together two major players in the Japanese toy industry, combining their strengths and popular product lines like Transformers, Beyblade, and Tomica to create a more competitive global toy company[4][5].
