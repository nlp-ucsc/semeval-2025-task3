Gillette Stadium was previously known as CMGI Field before it opened in 2002[3][4]. The stadium was initially set to be called CMGI Field under a naming rights agreement with CMGI, an internet company. However, due to the dot-com bust, CMGI was unable to fulfill its naming rights contract. As a result, the Gillette Company acquired the naming rights shortly before the stadium opened, and it has been known as Gillette Stadium since its inauguration in 2002[3][4].

Before Gillette Stadium was built, the New England Patriots played at Foxboro Stadium from 1971 to 2001[6][7]. Foxboro Stadium itself had undergone several name changes over the years:

1. It opened in 1971 as Schaefer Stadium, named after the Schaefer Brewing Company[6][7].
2. In 1983, it was renamed Sullivan Stadium, after the Sullivan family who owned the Patriots at the time[6].
3. Finally, in 1989, it became known as Foxboro Stadium, a name it kept until its demolition in 2002[6][7].

The transition from Foxboro Stadium to Gillette Stadium marked a significant upgrade for the New England Patriots and New England Revolution, providing a modern, state-of-the-art facility for both teams and their fans[1][4].
