FC Zhenis plays their home matches at the K.Munaitpasov Stadium (also known as Kazhymukan Munaitpasov Stadium) in Astana, Kazakhstan[4][7]. The stadium has a capacity of 12,343 spectators[4].

Some key details about FC Zhenis and their stadium:

1. Location: The K.Munaitpasov Stadium is located in Astana (now known as Nur-Sultan), the capital city of Kazakhstan[4][7].

2. Capacity: The stadium can accommodate 12,343 spectators[4][7].

3. Club history: FC Zhenis has undergone several name changes since its founding in 1964. It has been known as Dinamo, Tselinnik, Tsesna, Astana, Namys, and Astana-1964 before returning to the name Zhenis in 2021[7].

4. Stadium history: The K.Munaitpasov Stadium was the home of FC Zhenis (under its various names) for many years, including when the club was more prominent in Kazakh football[10].

5. Contrast with new club: The article mentions that a newer club, FC Astana, was formed in 2009 and plays at the larger Astana Arena (capacity 30,254)[1][2]. This has created some tension between supporters of the older club (FC Zhenis) and the newer one[10].

6. Current status: As of 2025, FC Zhenis continues to use the K.Munaitpasov Stadium as its home ground[5][6][9].

It's worth noting that while FC Zhenis has a long history in Astana, it has faced financial difficulties and relegation in recent years, which has affected its prominence in Kazakh football[7][10].
