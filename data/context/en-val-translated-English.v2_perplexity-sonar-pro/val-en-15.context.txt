The White-winged Chough was first described by French naturalist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1817[1][6]. Vieillot initially named the species Coracia melanorhamphos[1][6]. 

After Vieillot's initial description, the White-winged Chough received several other scientific names from different naturalists:

1. In 1820, Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck gave it the name Pyrrhocorax leucopterus[1].

2. In 1830, French naturalist René-Primevère Lesson named it Corcorax australis[1].

However, the current scientific name, Corcorax melanorhamphos, was ultimately settled by Gregory Mathews in 1912[1]. This name combines the genus Corcorax with the specific epithet melanorhamphos, which is derived from the Ancient Greek words "melano-" meaning "black" and "rhamphos" meaning "beak"[1].

It's worth noting that despite its common name and superficial resemblance, the White-winged Chough is not closely related to the European choughs. It is actually one of only two surviving members of the Australian mud-nest builders family, Corcoracidae, and the sole member of the genus Corcorax[1].
