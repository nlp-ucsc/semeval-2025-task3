Western orioles, specifically the Bullock's Oriole and Hooded Oriole, are medium-sized songbirds. Here are their typical size measurements:

Bullock's Oriole:
- Length: 6.7-7.5 inches (17-19 cm)[1]
- Weight: 1.0-1.5 ounces (29-43 g)[1]
- Wingspan: 12.2 inches (31 cm)[1]

Hooded Oriole:
- Length: 7.1-7.9 inches (18-20 cm)[2]
- Weight: 0.8 ounces (24 g)[2]
- Wingspan: 9.1-11.0 inches (23-28 cm)[2]

For comparison, both species are described as being roughly robin-sized[1][2]. They are larger than smaller songbirds like warblers or finches, but smaller than birds like Western Kingbirds[2].

These orioles have slim but sturdy bodies with medium-long tails[1]. They possess long, thick-based, sharply pointed bills, which is a characteristic shared with their blackbird relatives[1]. The Hooded Oriole's bill is slightly more curved downward compared to other orioles[2].

In terms of visual size reference:
- Bullock's Oriole is larger than a Yellow Warbler and about the same size but slimmer than a Brewer's Blackbird[1].
- Hooded Oriole is larger than a House Finch but smaller than a Western Kingbird[2].

These size characteristics, combined with their distinctive coloration patterns, make western orioles striking and recognizable birds in their habitats.
