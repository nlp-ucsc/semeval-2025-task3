The municipality of Delley-Portalban was created on 1 January 2005[1][2][3][4]. It was formed through the merger of two previously separate municipalities - Delley and Portalban[1][2]. Specifically:

- Delley-Portalban is located in the district of Broye, in the canton of Fribourg, Switzerland[1][2].

- The merger combined the village of Delley (first mentioned in 1342 as "Deler") and the village of Portalban (first mentioned in 1166 as "Portubanni")[1][2].

- In the local Arpitan dialect, Portalban is known as "Pôrt-Alban" or locally as "Pouraban" [puʁaˈbɑ̃][1][2].

This municipal merger was part of a broader trend in Switzerland of consolidating smaller communes into larger administrative units for improved efficiency and governance. The creation of Delley-Portalban brought together the resources and populations of these two historically distinct communities along the shore of Lake Neuchâtel.
