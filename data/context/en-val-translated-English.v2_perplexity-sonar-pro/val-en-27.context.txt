In the TV series White Collar, Special Agent Peter Burke is the head of the FBI's White Collar Crimes Unit in New York City[1][3]. Peter Burke is portrayed by actor Tim DeKay[1][5]. 

Peter Burke is a senior FBI agent who leads the White Collar division and serves as Neal Caffrey's direct superior and handler[1]. He is described as a no-nonsense, by-the-book agent who is extremely devoted to his job and his wife Elizabeth[1]. Throughout the series, Peter works closely with Neal Caffrey, a former con artist who becomes an FBI consultant, to solve complex white collar crimes[3].

Peter is known for his tenacity and skill in catching criminals. In fact, he was the agent responsible for originally capturing Neal Caffrey after a three-year pursuit[3]. When Neal escapes from prison near the end of his sentence, it's Peter who recaptures him. This leads to their unconventional partnership when Neal proposes to help the FBI catch other white collar criminals in exchange for his release from prison[3].

As the head of the White Collar Crimes Unit, Peter oversees a team that includes other agents like Diana Berrigan and Clinton Jones[1]. His leadership and experience are crucial in guiding the team through challenging cases involving art theft, forgery, and other sophisticated crimes[5].
