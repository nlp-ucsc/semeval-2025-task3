There are three main stages of labor in childbirth:

1. First Stage: Labor and cervical dilation
This is the longest stage and consists of three phases:

- Early labor (latent phase): The cervix begins to soften, thin out (efface), and dilate from 0 to 6 centimeters. Contractions start mild and irregular, gradually becoming stronger and more frequent[1][2].

- Active labor: The cervix dilates from 6 to 8 centimeters. Contractions become more intense and regular[1][2].

- Transition: The cervix fully dilates to 10 centimeters. This is often the most challenging phase, with very strong contractions[2].

2. Second Stage: Pushing and birth
This stage begins when the cervix is fully dilated and ends with the birth of the baby. It typically lasts 20 minutes to 2 hours or more. During this stage, you actively push with contractions to deliver your baby[1][2][5].

3. Third Stage: Delivery of the placenta
This final stage involves the delivery of the placenta, also known as the "afterbirth." It usually lasts between a few minutes to 30 minutes after the baby is born[1][2][5].

Some sources also mention a fourth stage, which refers to the first few hours after birth when the mother's body begins to recover and bonding with the baby occurs[6].

The duration of each stage can vary significantly between individuals and may be influenced by factors such as whether it's a first birth, the use of pain medication, and the specific circumstances of the labor[1][2].
