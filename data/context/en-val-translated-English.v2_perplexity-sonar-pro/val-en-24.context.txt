The World Chess Federation, officially known as FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs), is currently based in Switzerland[1][2]. Specifically, FIDE has its headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland[1][6].

FIDE was initially founded on July 20, 1924, in Paris, France[1][2][3]. However, its location has changed over time. The move to Switzerland likely occurred as part of FIDE's efforts to establish itself as a major international sporting organization.

Some key points about FIDE's history and current status:

1. Founding: FIDE was founded in Paris, France, on July 20, 1924[1][2][3].

2. Initial members: The founding member countries included Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Finland, France, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, and Great Britain[3].

3. Current scope: FIDE now encompasses 201 countries as affiliate members in the form of National Chess Federations[1].

4. Olympic recognition: In 1999, FIDE was recognized by the International Olympic Committee as a Global Sporting Organization[1][4].

5. Governance: FIDE is the governing body of the sport of chess and regulates all international chess competitions[1][2].

6. Motto: FIDE's motto is "Gens una sumus," which is Latin for "We are one family"[1][2].

The relocation to Switzerland aligns with the country's reputation for neutrality and its role as a host to many international organizations. This move likely helps FIDE maintain its status as a global governing body for chess.
