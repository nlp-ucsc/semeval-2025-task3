Dave Franco played the character Cole Aaronson in the final season of Scrubs[1][4][5]. Cole was introduced as a new medical student at Winston University in season 9 of the show, which aired in 2009-2010[1][4].

Cole Aaronson was characterized as a wealthy, entitled medical student who essentially bought his way into an internship at Sacred Heart Hospital[4][5]. Franco's character was described as "charming, conservative, confidently stupid and incredibly entitled"[1]. Despite his privileged background and initial arrogance, Cole's character developed over the course of the season:

1. He entered a romantic relationship with Lucy, another medical student, which had its ups and downs[4].

2. Cole faced a serious medical scare that became a defining part of his story arc in Season 9[4].

3. By the end of the season, he had gained the confidence of Dr. Turk and overcome his health issues, showing some personal growth[4].

Franco appeared in 13 episodes of Scrubs[3], joining the cast as a series regular for what would become the show's final season[1][2]. This role came relatively early in Franco's career and helped to establish him as a comedic actor before he went on to more prominent film roles[5].
