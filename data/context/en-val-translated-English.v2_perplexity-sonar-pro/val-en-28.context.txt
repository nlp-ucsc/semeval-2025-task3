Dr. Winthrop Phelps was the first physician to specifically treat patients for cerebral palsy. In the 1930s and 1940s, Dr. Phelps pioneered a new approach to treating cerebral palsy that focused on the musculoskeletal aspects of the condition rather than just the neurological components[10].

Some key points about Dr. Phelps' contributions:

1. In 1937, he founded the Children's Rehabilitation Institute in Maryland, which was the first institution dedicated solely to the treatment and care of children with cerebral palsy[3].

2. In 1932, Dr. Phelps published the first professional journal article about cerebral palsy since 1843. In this article, he emphasized that not all children with cerebral palsy had cognitive challenges, but rather their motor controls were primarily impaired[3].

3. Dr. Phelps insisted that people with cerebral palsy could be productive members of society, which was a progressive view for the time[3].

4. In 1947, Dr. Phelps founded the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy along with five other doctors who were working with cerebral palsy patients. He was elected as the first President of this organization[3][7].

5. Phelps' main recommendations for treatment included relaxing procedures, achieving head and trunk control, and training reciprocal movements. These approaches are still considered relevant for motor rehabilitation in cerebral palsy patients today[7].

6. He emphasized the importance of long-term movement training, noting that it sometimes produced unexpected positive results and could help avoid surgical treatment in some cases[7].

While earlier physicians like Dr. William Little, Sir William Osler, and Dr. Sigmund Freud made significant contributions to understanding and defining cerebral palsy, Dr. Winthrop Phelps was the first to develop and implement specific treatment approaches for the condition. His work laid the foundation for the multidisciplinary approach to cerebral palsy treatment that is still used today.
