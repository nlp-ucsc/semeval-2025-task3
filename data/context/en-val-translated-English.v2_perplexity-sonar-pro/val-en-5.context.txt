The UN Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) defines a sustainable city as one that is inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable[1][3]. Specifically, SDG 11 aims to "Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable" by 2030[3][6].

Key aspects of sustainable cities according to SDG 11 include:

1. Adequate, safe, and affordable housing: Ensuring access to proper housing and basic services for all, including upgrading slums[1][6].

2. Sustainable transport systems: Providing safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transportation, with a focus on expanding public transport and improving road safety[3][6].

3. Inclusive and sustainable urbanization: Enhancing participatory, integrated, and sustainable urban planning and management[1][6].

4. Protection of cultural and natural heritage: Strengthening efforts to safeguard the world's cultural and natural heritage[3][6].

5. Disaster resilience: Reducing the number of deaths, people affected, and economic losses caused by disasters, including water-related disasters[3][6].

6. Reduced environmental impact: Decreasing the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, with particular attention to air quality and waste management[3][6].

7. Access to green and public spaces: Providing universal access to safe, inclusive, and accessible green and public spaces, especially for vulnerable groups[3][6].

8. Urban-rural linkages: Supporting positive economic, social, and environmental connections between urban, peri-urban, and rural areas through strengthened national and regional development planning[3][6].

9. Integrated policies for inclusion, resource efficiency, and disaster risk reduction: Substantially increasing the number of cities adopting and implementing such policies[3][6].

Sustainable cities are also characterized by:

- Resource efficiency and low carbon emissions[2]
- Resilience to climate change and natural disasters[3]
- Promotion of sustainable economic growth and job creation[4]
- Emphasis on green spaces, urban farming, and sustainable architecture[2]

In essence, SDG 11 envisions sustainable cities as urban centers that balance social, economic, and environmental needs while providing a high quality of life for all residents, particularly the most vulnerable populations.
