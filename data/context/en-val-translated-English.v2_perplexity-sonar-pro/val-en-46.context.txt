Two Roman emperors were born in Lugdunum (modern-day Lyon, France):

1. Claudius: Born on August 1, 10 BC, Claudius was the first Roman emperor to be born outside Italy[1][3][5]. His full name at birth was Tiberius Claudius Drusus, later changed to Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus upon becoming emperor[1]. Claudius ruled as Roman emperor from 41 to 54 AD[3].

2. Caracalla: Born in 185 AD, Caracalla was also born in Lugdunum[4][6]. His birth name was Lucius Septimius Bassianus, and he ruled as Roman emperor from 198 to 217 AD.

Lugdunum held significant importance in the Roman Empire:

- It was founded as a Roman colony in 43 BC[7].
- The city became the capital of the Roman province of Gallia Lugdunensis[6].
- By the end of Claudius' reign, the city's official name had become Colonia Copia Claudia Augusta Lugdunum[6].
- Lugdunum was a major center in Gaul, with Marcus Agrippa involved in its expansion[4].
- The city served as an administrative center for Roman Gaul and Germany[6].

The birth of these two emperors in Lugdunum underscores the city's prominence within the Roman Empire and its role as a significant provincial capital.
