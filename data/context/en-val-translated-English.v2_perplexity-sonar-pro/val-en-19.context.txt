Captain Morgan rum was invented in 1944 by the Seagram Company[1][2][5][6]. Here are some key details about the brand's origins:

The Seagram Company, a Canadian multinational corporation, created the Captain Morgan Rum Company in 1944[4]. This marked the official beginning of the Captain Morgan brand.

The company's CEO, Samuel Bronfman, purchased the Long Pond distillery from the Jamaican government[1][5]. Along with the distillery, Bronfman also acquired the rights to a rum recipe that was being produced by a Kingston pharmacy[5].

The original rum recipe had an interesting backstory. The Levy Brothers pharmacy in Kingston, Jamaica, was buying raw rum from the Long Pond distillery, infusing it with medicinal herbs and spices, aging it, and then bottling it for sale in their shop[2]. When Bronfman tasted this aged spiced rum, he purchased the rights to the recipe and began producing it commercially under the Captain Morgan label[2].

Initially, Captain Morgan rum was produced in Jamaica using this centuries-old Jamaican recipe, resulting in a dark and rich flavor profile[4]. However, in the 1950s, production was moved to Puerto Rico, where the rum began to be distilled in larger quantities and aged for shorter periods, leading to a lighter, smoother flavor[4].

The brand's name and imagery were inspired by Sir Henry Morgan, a 17th-century Welsh privateer who later became the Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica[1][4]. This historical connection to the Caribbean and the romantic allure of pirate lore has been a significant part of the brand's identity and marketing strategy since its inception.

It's worth noting that while the brand was created in 1944, Captain Morgan's flagship product, the Original Spiced Rum, wasn't introduced to the United States market until 1984[2][6]. This spiced variant quickly gained popularity and has since become the brand's most well-known product.
