Bischofsheim was a constituent community of Mainz from 1930 to 1945. Specifically:

1. On January 1, 1930, Bischofsheim was incorporated as part of the city of Mainz[1][8].

2. This incorporation lasted until the end of World War II in 1945[2][8].

3. After 1945, the American and French occupying authorities separated Bischofsheim from Mainz. This was because the Rhine river became the boundary between the American and French occupation zones[4][8].

4. Following this separation, Bischofsheim once again became an independent municipality in the Gro√ü-Gerau district of Hesse[8].

5. Despite no longer being part of Mainz, the main railway station in Bischofsheim is still called "Mainz-Bischofsheim" as a legacy of this period[2].

It's worth noting that this incorporation into Mainz was part of a larger administrative reorganization. Other nearby communities like Ginsheim and Gustavsburg were also incorporated into Mainz during this period[4]. The incorporation was driven by financial difficulties faced by these communities in the late 1920s, including the need for infrastructure improvements[1].
