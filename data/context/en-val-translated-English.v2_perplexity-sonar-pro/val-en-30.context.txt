Before the Civil War, Valrico, Florida was known as Long Pond[1][3][4]. The area consisted of several cotton plantations surrounding what is now called Valrico Lake, which was originally referred to as Long Pond[1][3]. This name derived from the long, gourd-shaped 55-acre lake located north of State Road 60, south of Wheeler Road, and west of Valrico Road[4].

The region remained known as Long Pond until the 1880s when William G. Tousey, a philosophy professor from Tufts College in Boston, purchased property in the area[1][3]. Tousey was impressed by the landscape, which at the time featured orange groves and pine forests[4]. He renamed the area "Valrico," which is Spanish for "rich valley," despite the lack of an actual valley in the region[1][3].

It's worth noting that the transformation from Long Pond to Valrico marked the beginning of significant changes in the area:

1. In 1890, the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad was completed, bringing new immigrants to the region[1][3].

2. Tousey and others began developing the community, building streets, a post office, and various businesses[1][4].

3. By 1893, the population had grown to about 100 people, though it would later decline due to economic challenges[3][4].

This transition from Long Pond to Valrico represents an important shift in the area's history, moving from a primarily agricultural region dominated by cotton plantations to a more diverse and developed community in the post-Civil War era.
