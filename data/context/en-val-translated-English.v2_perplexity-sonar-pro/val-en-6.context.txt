Zhejiang cuisine consists of four main styles, each originating from a different area within Zhejiang province:

1. Hangzhou style: This is considered the most representative and prestigious style of Zhejiang cuisine[1][4]. Hangzhou-style dishes are characterized by their:
   - Light and fresh flavors
   - Emphasis on seasonal ingredients
   - Frequent use of bamboo shoots (said to be included in at least half of their dishes)[1]
   - Elegant presentation
   - Cooking methods including stir-frying, steaming, and pot-roasting[1]

2. Ningbo style: Known for its seafood dishes, Ningbo cuisine features:
   - Fresh and salty flavors
   - Emphasis on the original taste of carefully selected ingredients
   - Unique cooking techniques like quick-frying, stir-frying, deep-frying, simmering, and steaming[1]
   - Focus on preserving the tenderness and freshness of the food

3. Shaoxing style: This inland style is noted for its:
   - Use of poultry and freshwater fish[3]
   - Mild and refreshing flavors
   - Incorporation of local ingredients like beans and bamboo shoots
   - Frequent use of Shaoxing rice wine in cooking[1]
   - Steaming and stewing as common cooking methods

4. Wenzhou style (also known as Ou cuisine): While some sources consider this a separate subdivision, it's often included as the fourth style of Zhejiang cuisine[3]. Wenzhou style is characterized by:
   - Extensive use of seafood due to its coastal location
   - Incorporation of poultry and livestock
   - Light and delicate flavors[7]
   - Proximity to Fujian province, which influences some of its dishes

Each of these styles contributes to the overall reputation of Zhejiang cuisine as being fresh, light, and delicate, with an emphasis on the natural flavors of the ingredients[2][3]. The cuisine as a whole is known for its careful selection of ingredients, meticulous preparation methods, and the use of seasonal produce to create dishes that are both visually appealing and delicious[4][7].
