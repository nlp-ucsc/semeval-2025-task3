حسناً، سؤال Origin about when Takara announced its dissolution. Takara is a well-known Japanese toy company, famous for products like Transformers and Beyblades. I need to find out when Takara announced it was dissolving.

I remember that Takara went through some restructuring. Maybe around the mid-2000s? I think they merged with another company. Was it Tomy? Yes, Takara merged with Tomy in 2006. So, they didn't exactly dissolve; they became Takara Tomy. I should confirm the exact date of the announcement. Probably around 2005 when they first announced the merger plans.

So, the answer would be that Takara announced its merger with Tomy in 2005, leading to the formation of Takara Tomy in 2006. They didn't dissolve but merged with another company. Make sure to mention that.
