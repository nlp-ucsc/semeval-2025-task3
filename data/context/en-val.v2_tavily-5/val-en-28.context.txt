The Medical History of Cerebral Palsy. The first known research into the condition that would become known as cerebral palsy was done by British doctor William John Little beginning in the 1830s. Dr. Little researched and wrote about spastic diplegia and pseudo-hypertrophic muscular dystrophy. In 1861, Dr. Little wrote about a birth injury that

He saw the link between a degree of paresis and a degree of mental retardation in patients . Little was, therefore, one of the first to describe what might now be called "cerebral palsy", although he never used this term in any of his works. The first person to do so was William Osler in 1888 .

Previously, experts thought that cerebral palsy only occurred during a difficult childbirth. Dr. Sigmund Freud was the first to divide cerebral palsy causes into those that occurred before, during, and after birth. Before that, orthopedic surgeon Dr. William Little had postulated that cerebral palsy was acquired at birth due to difficult labor.

In 1947, Dr. Phelps founded the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy with five other doctors who were working with patients with cerebral palsy. He was elected as the first President. Over 70 years later, the organization was renamed the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine (AACPDM), and still exists today.

William John Little was one of the first orthopedic surgeons to research congenital malformations and their causes in the nineteenth century and presented preliminary research on a condition modernly known as cerebral palsy, a condition of varying severity that affects a person's ability to move. Little worked throughout the United Kingdom for the majority of the time he practiced medicine
