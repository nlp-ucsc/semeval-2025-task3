An Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) is a hardware component that connects a DMA-capable I/O bus to system memory. It maps device-visible virtual addresses to physical addresses, making it useful in virtualization. In the WDDM 2.0 IoMmu model, each process has a single virtual address space that is: Shared between the CPU and GPU.
