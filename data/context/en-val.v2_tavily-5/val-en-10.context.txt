There are three stages of labor, stage 1 is the longest and occurs when the cervix begins to thin and dilate. During stage 2 of labor the baby passes through the birth canal and remains there until delivery, and stage 3, is when the baby is delivered.

Labor (childbirth) is the process of a baby leaving your uterus through your vagina or a cesarean birth (c-section). It usually happens between 37 and 42 weeks (9 to 10 months) of pregnancy. There are three stages of labor:

The first stage of labor is the longest of the three stages. It's divided into two phases â€” early labor and active labor. Early labor. During early labor, also called latent labor, the cervix opens and softens. It also gets shorter and thinner. The cervix opens less than 6 centimeters (cm) in early labor.

First stage of labor. The first stage of labor is divided into three phases: early, active and transition. The first stage of labor is when the cervix dilates (opens) to 10 centimeters. Early labor. Early labor contractions pull on the cervix, which looks a bit like the neck of a turtleneck sweater. Contractions shorten or thin the cervix.

There are two phases to the first stage of labor: early labor and active labor. Early Labor When you begin early labor, also known as the latent phase, you can expect irregular mild to moderate contractions that last about 30-60 seconds every five to 20 minutes.
