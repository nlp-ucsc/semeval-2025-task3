Antennae (singular antenna) are paired appendages connected to the anterior-most segments of arthropods.In crustaceans, they are present on the first two segments of the head, with the smaller pair known as antennules and the larger pair biramous (branched). All other arthropod groups, except chelicerates and proturans (which have none), have a single, uniramous pair of antennae, such as

Arthropods have a common ancestor that likely possessed antennae similar to trilobites and modern crustaceans. Antenna, or antennae, are a pair of sense organs or appendages used for sensing. ... like lobsters, crabs, and shrimp, all have antennas. And almost all insects have antennae, such as ants, butterflies, beetles, grasshoppers

Antennae are movable sensory organs on the head of most arthropods. All insects have a pair of antennae, but spiders have none. Insect antennae are segmented, ... The segments of plumose antennae have fine branches, giving them a feathery appearance. The term plumose derives from the Latin pluma,

All arthropods differ from their annelid ancestors in several important ways: they have a chitinous exoskeleton, jointed/segmented appendages, a well-developed head and mouthparts, striated muscles, and an open circulatory system with a dorsal heart. ... They lack antennae but have six pairs of segmented appendages: fang-like chelicerae and

[46] [47] [41] In some segments of all known arthropods, the appendages have been modified, for example to form gills, mouth-parts, antennae for collecting information, [42] ... but only two in chelicerates, which do not have antennae or the ganglion connected to them. The ganglia of other head segments are often close to the brain and function
