The order contains one family (Erysiphaceae), 28 genera and around 1000 species. [2] Many imperfect fungi (fungi whose sexual reproduction is unknown) belong here, especially the genus Oidium.Recent molecular data have revealed the existence of six main evolutionary lineages. Clade 1 consists of Erysiphe, Microsphaera, and Uncinula, all of which have an Oidium subgenus Pseudoidium mitosporic

To date, sixteen genera containing ~ 900 species have been described in the Erysiphales order (Braun & Cook, 2012). While 12 genera (including Blumeria, Erysiphe and Golovinomyces) are ectoparasites that produce vegetative mycelium and conidiospores epiphytically on the host surface, four genera are endoparasites that produce internal mycelia
