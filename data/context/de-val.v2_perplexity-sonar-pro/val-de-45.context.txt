Based on the information provided in the search results, it appears that Leutfred II was the Duke of Alemannia (Herzog der Alemannen) until around 695.

Specifically, search result [2] states in German:

"Die Regierungszeit Leutfreds II. als Herzog der Alemannen endet."

Which translates to:

"The reign of Leutfred II as Duke of the Alemanns ends."

This information is listed under the year 695, indicating that Leutfred II's rule as Duke of Alemannia came to an end in that year[2].

The search results do not provide much additional detail about Leutfred II or his reign. However, they do mention that after 695, the Frankish mayor of the palace Pepin of Herstal began expanding his control over Alemannia and other regions[2]. This suggests that Leutfred II's end as duke may have been related to increasing Frankish influence over the Alemannic territory.

It's worth noting that information about the Alemannic dukes of this period is somewhat limited in the provided sources. The next clearly identified Duke of Alemannia in the search results is Gotfrid (also known as Gotefrid or Gottfried), who ruled until his death in 709[1][8]. However, there is no explicit mention of Gotfrid directly succeeding Leutfred II in 695.
