The three novels in Chris Claremont's Shadow War trilogy are:

1. Shadow Moon (1995)
2. Shadow Dawn (1996) 
3. Shadow Star (1999)

These novels were co-written by Chris Claremont and George Lucas as a continuation of the 1988 film Willow[1][2][4]. The trilogy follows the further adventures of Elora Danan and other characters from the Willow movie universe.

Some key details about this trilogy:
