Before being renamed Valrico, the area was known as Long Pond[1][3][6]. 

Specifically:

- Prior to the Civil War, the region consisted of several cotton plantations and was called Long Pond[1][3].

- The area surrounding what is now Valrico Lake was first known as "Long Pond"[1].

- Long Pond, also referred to as Lake Hunter by some, is a 55-acre gourd-shaped lake located north of State Road 60, south of Wheeler Road and west of Valrico Road[6].

The name change occurred in the 1880s when William G. Tousey, a philosophy professor from Tufts College, purchased property in the area and renamed it Valrico, meaning "rich valley" in Spanish[1][3][6]. This new name was chosen despite there not actually being a valley in the area[1].
