Divadlo, které založili Šlitr, Suchý a Havlík, se nazývá Divadlo Semafor. This theater, founded by the renowned Czech artists Jiří Šlitr, Jiří Suchý, and Ferdinand Havlík, became a significant cultural institution in Prague during the 1960s, known for its unique blend of music, comedy, and satire. The name "Semafor" itself is a play on words, combining the Czech word for "traffic light" (semafor) with the initials of the founders (S, S, H). The theater quickly gained popularity for its innovative and often politically charged performances, which resonated with audiences during a period of cultural and political change in Czechoslovakia.
