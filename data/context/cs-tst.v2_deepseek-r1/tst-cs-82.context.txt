Rudé právo (česky "Red Law") was a major Czech daily newspaper that served as the official organ of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ) from 1920 to 1989. It was one of the most widely read and influential newspapers in Czechoslovakia during the communist era. The paper was founded in 1920, shortly after the establishment of the KSČ, and its name reflects its ideological orientation—it was meant to be the "red" or communist alternative to other newspapers.

Rudé právo played a crucial role in promoting the policies and ideology of the Communist Party. It was the primary medium through which the party communicated its messages to the public, and it was known for its propaganda efforts, supporting the socialist state and its leaders. The newspaper often featured articles on political developments, economic achievements, and cultural events, all framed within the context of socialist ideology.

During the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, which put an end to the period of liberalization known as the Prague Spring, Rudé právo was one of the key outlets used to justify the invasion and to enforce the normalization process that followed. After 1968, the newspaper became even more rigid in its adherence to the party line.

With the fall of the communist regime in November 1989, Rudé právo lost its role as the official party organ. In 1990, the newspaper was renamed Právo, and it attempted to transform itself into a more neutral, centrist publication. However, it struggled to rebuild its reputation and readership in the post-communist era. Despite efforts to modernize, the newspaper faced financial difficulties and declining circulation.

In summary, Rudé právo was a significant propaganda tool of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, playing a key role in shaping public opinion and promoting the regime's policies during its existence. Its influence waned significantly after the fall of communism in 1989.
