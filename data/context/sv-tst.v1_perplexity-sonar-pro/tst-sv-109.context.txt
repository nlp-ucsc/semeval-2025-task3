I apologize, but based on the search results provided, I don't have enough information to determine which canton Chassagnes is located in. The search results do not mention Chassagnes being part of any specific Swiss canton. 

However, I can provide some relevant information about Chassagnes:

Chassagnes is a commune in France, not in Switzerland. It is located in the Haute-Loire department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region of south-east central France[1]. The search results do not mention any Swiss canton in relation to Chassagnes.

Some key facts about Chassagnes:

1. It is a commune, which is an administrative division in France.
2. Its coordinates are 45°12′55″N 3°32′20″E[1].
3. The current mayor (as of 2020-2026) is Mikaël Vacher[1].
4. The area of Chassagnes is 12.24 km2 (4.73 sq mi)[1].
5. The population has fluctuated over the years, with 155 inhabitants recorded in 2020[1].

It's important to note that while the query asks about a canton, which is typically associated with Switzerland, Chassagnes is actually in France and therefore not part of the Swiss canton system.
