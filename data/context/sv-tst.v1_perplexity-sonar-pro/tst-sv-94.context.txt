The alliance between Sparta, Athens, and Ptolemy II of Egypt was created by the Athenian statesman and general Chremonides in 268/267 BC[1][3][5]. 

This alliance was formalized through a decree known as the Decree of Chremonides, which was passed in the second prytany of the archonship of Peithidemos[3]. The exact date is sometimes given as 268 BC[5], while other sources place it between 269 and 267 BC[7].

The decree created an anti-Macedonian coalition aimed at challenging the dominance of Antigonid Macedonia under Antigonus II Gonatas[1][8]. It brought together Athens, Sparta, and Ptolemaic Egypt, along with several other Greek city-states[3].

Key points about the alliance:

1. It was led by Chremonides in Athens and King Areus I in Sparta[6].

2. Ptolemy II Philadelphus of Egypt provided support, including naval forces and financial subsidies[6].

3. The alliance also included other Peloponnesian states like Elis, Achaia, and some Arcadian cities[6].

4. Several Cretan cities were also part of this coalition[6].

5. The decree compared this alliance to the earlier Greek coalition against Persia in 480 BC[6].

This alliance marked a significant moment in Hellenistic politics, as it represented a major challenge to Macedonian hegemony in Greece. It led to the Chremonidean War (267-261 BC), which ultimately ended in a Macedonian victory[1][8].
