Wheein officially debuted as a member of Mamamoo in June 2014[1]. Specifically, Mamamoo made their debut on June 18, 2014 with the release of their debut single "Mr. Ambiguous" and EP "Hello"[1].

Prior to the official debut, Wheein had first appeared with Mamamoo in January 2014 in the group's first R&B collaboration song "Don't Be Happy", which featured Wheein, fellow Mamamoo member Solar, and Korean singer Bumkey[1].

Mamamoo was formed by RBW Entertainment, and Wheein trained under their idol system before debuting with the group[5]. The formation of Mamamoo has an interesting backstory - they were initially a nameless five-member group that performed an English song called "MAMAMOO" at a Quincy Jones concert in Seoul. After that performance, it was suggested they use "MAMAMOO" as their group name, and their debut song "Mr. Ambiguous" was adapted from that original English song[5].

So in summary, while Wheein had been training and preparing with Mamamoo for some time before, she officially joined and debuted with the group in June 2014 when they made their formal debut as a four-member girl group.
