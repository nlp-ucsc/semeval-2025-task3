French troops occupied Korçë in December 1916. Specifically:

On December 10, 1916, fourteen Albanian delegates (seven Muslims and seven Christians) proclaimed the Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë under French military protection[3]. This came after negotiations between local Albanian leaders and French forces who had recently taken control of the city during World War I[5].

The occupation occurred as part of developments on the Macedonian Front of World War I. As French forces advanced, they took control of Korçë and established an autonomous province there from 1916-1920[5].

The key events were:

1. French forces entered and occupied Korçë in late 1916 as part of their Balkan campaign in WWI.

2. On December 10, 1916, local Albanian leaders and French Colonel Descoins signed a protocol establishing the Autonomous Province of Korçë under French protection[3][5].

3. This autonomous entity, sometimes called the Republic of Korçë, lasted until 1920 when Korçë was fully integrated into the independent Albanian state[7].

The French occupation brought significant changes to Korçë, including making Albanian an official language, opening Albanian schools, and giving the local population some degree of self-governance under French oversight[3][5]. This period marked an important transition as Korçë shifted from Greek to Albanian control in the aftermath of WWI.
