The Genkyō period in Japanese history lasted from 1321 to 1324. During this time, the reigning emperor of Japan was Emperor Go-Daigo[1].

Emperor Go-Daigo was the 96th emperor of Japan according to the traditional order of succession. He reigned from 1318 to 1339, which encompasses the Genkyō period. Go-Daigo is particularly notable for his role in the Kenmu Restoration, which occurred shortly after the Genkyō period[1].

The Kenmu Restoration was a three-year period from 1333 to 1336 during which Emperor Go-Daigo attempted to restore direct imperial rule in Japan. He succeeded in overthrowing the Kamakura shogunate with the help of Ashikaga Takauji, a defected Kamakura general. This brief period marked a significant attempt to return power directly to the emperor after centuries of shogunate rule[1].

However, Go-Daigo's direct rule proved inefficient and ultimately failed. Ashikaga Takauji, who had initially helped Go-Daigo, eventually turned against him and seized political power for himself, establishing the Ashikaga shogunate[1].

It's worth noting that while Go-Daigo was the reigning emperor during the Genkyō period, the actual power in Japan at this time was still largely held by the Kamakura shogunate, as the Kenmu Restoration had not yet taken place. The emperor's role was largely ceremonial until Go-Daigo's attempt to restore imperial power in 1333.
