Cyrtophora moluccensis was first described by Carl Ludwig Doleschall in 1857[3][5]. Doleschall was an Austrian arachnologist and entomologist who worked in Indonesia in the mid-19th century. He published the original description of this spider species, giving it its scientific name and formally introducing it to the scientific community.

Some key points about the original description:

1. Year: 1857
2. Author: Carl Ludwig Doleschall
3. Scientific name: Cyrtophora moluccensis

This initial description by Doleschall established C. moluccensis as a distinct species within the genus Cyrtophora. Since then, the species has been studied further and its classification has been refined, but Doleschall retains credit as the original describer, which is why his name appears in parentheses after the scientific name: Cyrtophora moluccensis (Doleschall, 1857)[3][5].
