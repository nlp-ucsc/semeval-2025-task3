I apologize, but I don't have enough accurate information to determine the size of asteroid 8903 Paulcruikshank. The search results don't provide any specific details about this particular asteroid or its dimensions. 

Asteroids can vary greatly in size, ranging from just a few meters across to hundreds of kilometers in diameter. Without reliable data about asteroid 8903 Paulcruikshank from authoritative astronomical sources, I cannot provide its exact size.

To get accurate information about this asteroid's dimensions, it would be best to consult specialized astronomical databases or publications that catalog minor planets and asteroids. Organizations like NASA, the International Astronomical Union, or academic institutions focused on planetary science may have more detailed records about its physical characteristics.

If you need this specific information, I'd recommend searching astronomical journals or contacting astronomers who specialize in studying minor planets and asteroids. They would likely have access to the most up-to-date and accurate data about asteroid 8903 Paulcruikshank.
