HEALTH was founded in 2005 by the following musicians:

- Jake Duzsik - vocals, guitar
- John Famiglietti - bass, electronics
- Benjamin Jared Miller (B.J. Miller) - drums

The band originally also included:

- Jupiter Keyes - guitar, synthesizer (2005-2015)

Jake Duzsik and John Famiglietti met while working at the flagship Guitar Center store in Los Angeles. They decided to form a band and recruited B.J. Miller as the drummer through Craigslist. Jupiter Keyes, who was Duzsik's housemate, joined as guitarist and synthesizer player[1][2].

The band's name was chosen after they agreed it should be an "everyday word". When reviewing a list of potential names, "health" was the only one not already taken by another band[1].

HEALTH emerged from the Los Angeles underground experimental music scene, gaining prominence with a remix of their song "Crimewave" by Crystal Castles in 2007 before releasing their self-titled debut album later that year[1][2].
