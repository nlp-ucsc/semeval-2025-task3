The Aston Martin V12 Vanquish has been produced with different engine sizes across its generations:

The first generation V12 Vanquish (2001-2007) was equipped with a 5.9-liter (5,935 cc) V12 engine[1][5]. This naturally aspirated V12 had the following specifications:

- V12 Vanquish (2001-2004): 460 hp at 6,500 rpm, 400 lb-ft of torque at 5,000 rpm
- V12 Vanquish S (2004-2007): 520 hp at 7,000 rpm, 425 lb-ft of torque at 5,800 rpm[1]

The second generation Vanquish (2012-2018) continued to use a 5.9-liter V12 engine, with power output increased to 565 hp[1].

For the third generation Vanquish, unveiled in September 2024, Aston Martin introduced a new twin-turbocharged 5.2-liter V12 engine[1][3]. This latest iteration produces an impressive 835 PS (824 hp) and 1,000 Nm (738 lb-ft) of torque[3][8][9]. 

It's worth noting that Aston Martin has consistently used V12 engines in the Vanquish model, evolving the design over time to increase power output and efficiency while meeting modern emissions standards[2].
