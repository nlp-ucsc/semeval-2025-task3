Ben Johnson won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance as Sam the Lion in the film "The Last Picture Show" in 1972[1][7]. This award was part of the 26th British Academy Film Awards ceremony, which honored the best films of 1971[4].

Johnson's portrayal of Sam the Lion, a former cowboy and theater owner in a small Texas town during the 1950s, was widely acclaimed. This role not only earned him the BAFTA Award but also garnered him several other prestigious accolades, including:

1. The Academy Award (Oscar) for Best Supporting Actor[7][8]
2. The Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture[7][8]
3. The National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor[7]
4. The New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor[7]

"The Last Picture Show", directed by Peter Bogdanovich, was a coming-of-age drama set in a small Texas town. Johnson's performance as Sam the Lion was particularly noted for its authenticity and emotional depth, drawing on his real-life experiences as a rancher and cowboy[7].

This role represented the pinnacle of Johnson's acting career, which had begun decades earlier with stunt work and minor roles in Westerns. His win was especially meaningful as it recognized his transition from a primarily action-oriented performer to a nuanced character actor[7].
