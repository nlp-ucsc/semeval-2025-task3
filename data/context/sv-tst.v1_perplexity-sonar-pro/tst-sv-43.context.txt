Domantas Sabonis represented Lithuania in the 2016 Olympic Games held in Rio de Janeiro[1][2]. As the son of Lithuanian basketball legend Arvydas Sabonis, Domantas followed in his father's footsteps by playing for the Lithuanian national team[2].

At the time of the 2016 Olympics, Sabonis was just 20 years old and had recently been drafted into the NBA[2]. His participation in the Olympics came shortly after being selected as the 11th overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft by the Orlando Magic and subsequently traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder on draft night[3].

During the 2016 Olympics, Sabonis played in all six games for Lithuania, averaging 5.5 points and 4.5 rebounds per game[2][5]. This Olympic appearance was an important milestone in his early career, allowing him to gain valuable international experience while representing his country on the global stage.

It's worth noting that representing Lithuania in international competitions has been a significant part of Sabonis' career. He has continued to play for the Lithuanian national team in various tournaments, including the FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament in 2024, where he showcased his improved skills and leadership role within the team[4].
