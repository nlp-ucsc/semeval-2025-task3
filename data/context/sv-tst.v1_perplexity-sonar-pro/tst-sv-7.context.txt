Steelville, Missouri was named after James Steel, the town's founding father and first property owner[1][3]. Here are the key details about how Steelville got its name:

1. James Steel was one of the first settlers in the area, along with William Britton[1].

2. In 1835, Steel operated a trading post and was appointed by the government as Commissioner to lay out the city[1].

3. Steel purchased 40 acres of land from the government, which he later sold to the "County Court" on December 16, 1835, for $50[1][3].

4. By the time Steel sold the land, a small settlement had already begun to form in the area[1].

5. The Crawford County Court officially named the town Steelville in honor of James Steel when it was designated as the county seat[1][3].

6. The town was officially platted and the first deeds to lots were sold for $12 each after the naming[1].

7. Interestingly, while Steel was instrumental in founding the town, he did not remain there long-term. According to census records, he moved northward to pursue his interests in mining[1].

It's worth noting that before being named Steelville, the area was known as "Valley of Springs" due to its numerous natural springs[5]. The official incorporation of Steelville as a city of the fourth class occurred in 1885, at which time it had a population of about 500 inhabitants[1][3].
