I apologize, but I do not have any information about the population change in a municipality called Malville between 1962 and 2021. The search results provided do not contain any data about a place with that name or for that specific time period. The available information is mostly about population statistics in different regions of Sweden, but does not include details about Malville. Without access to reliable data about Malville's population figures for those years, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query.
