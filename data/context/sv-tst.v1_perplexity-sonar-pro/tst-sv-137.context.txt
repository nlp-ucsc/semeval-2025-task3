Paris Métro Line 8 has 38 stations[1][5][7]. This line connects Balard in the southwestern part of Paris to Pointe du Lac station in the southeastern suburbs, following a parabolic route on the Right Bank of the Seine[1]. At 23.4 km (14.5 mi) in length, it is the second longest Métro Line after Line 13, and the longest fully straight line, as line 13 has branches[1].

Some key points about Line 8:

1. It opened in July 1913 and was the last line of the original 1898 Paris Métro plan[1].

2. Along with Line 7, it serves the most stations of any line on the network, at 38[1].

3. Line 8 interchanges with all but three other Métro lines (Line 2, Line 3bis and Line 7bis)[1].

4. It includes 2.8 km (1.7 mi) of open-air tracks in the southeastern suburbs[1].

5. Notable stations along the line include Invalides, Concorde, Opéra, and Bastille, serving several major Parisian landmarks and tourist attractions[5].

6. The line extends beyond Paris city limits into the suburbs, with its southeastern terminus at Créteil – Pointe du Lac[1][7].

This extensive coverage makes Line 8 an important part of Paris's public transportation network, connecting various parts of the city and its southeastern suburbs.
