Nimravidae lived from the Middle Eocene through the Late Miocene epochs, spanning approximately 33.2 million years[1]. More specifically:

- The earliest recognizable nimravid fossils date back to the late Eocene, about 37 million years ago (Mya)[1].

- The most recent nimravid fossils are from the late Miocene, about 5-9 million years ago[1].

- The family's existence is generally dated from 40.4 to 7.2 million years ago, covering the Bartonian through Tortonian stages[1].

Some key points about the timeline of Nimravidae:

- They first appeared in the middle of the Eocene epoch, around 40 Mya, in North America and Asia[1].

- Nimravid diversity appears to have peaked about 28 Mya, during the Oligocene[1].

- They flourished in the cooler, drier climate that developed during the late Eocene and Oligocene[1].

- Nimravids disappeared from North America and Asia along with woodland habitats, but survived in relictual humid forests in Europe until the late Miocene[1].

- The last nimravids went extinct about 9 Mya when conditions changed in Europe during the late Miocene[1].

It's worth noting that while Nimravidae as a family existed during this time, individual genera and species within the family had shorter durations within this overall timespan.
