Liu Wenhui studied at the Baoding Military Academy, graduating in 1916[1]. The Baoding Military Academy was an important military school in China during the early 20th century that trained many influential military and political leaders.

After graduating from the Baoding Military Academy in 1916, Liu Wenhui returned to his home province of Sichuan and began his military career, serving as a staff officer under warlord Liu Cunhou of the Sichuan Army[1]. This education at Baoding and early military experience in Sichuan set the stage for Liu Wenhui's later rise as an important warlord and political figure in the region.
