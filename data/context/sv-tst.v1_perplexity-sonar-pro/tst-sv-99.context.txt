The film "Tuck Everlasting" is based on the children's novel of the same name written by Natalie Babbitt[1][5]. The book was originally published in 1975 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux[5]. It has become a classic of modern children's literature, selling over 5 million copies since its publication[5].

The novel tells the story of the Tuck family, who become immortal after drinking from a magical spring, and their encounter with a young girl named Winnie Foster[5]. It explores themes of immortality, the cycle of life, and what it means to truly live.

The 2002 film adaptation, directed by Jay Russell, stays largely true to the source material while expanding some elements for the screen[1][7]. It stars Alexis Bledel as Winnie Foster and features other notable actors like Ben Kingsley, Sissy Spacek, and William Hurt[1].

Natalie Babbitt's novel has been widely recognized for its literary merit, winning several awards including the Newbery Honor in 1976[3]. Its enduring popularity has led to multiple adaptations, including two feature films (in 1981 and 2002) and a Broadway musical[5].
