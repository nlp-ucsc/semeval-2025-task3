Erik Gunnar Asplund worked as a professor of architecture at the Royal Institute of Technology (Kungliga Tekniska h√∂gskolan or KTH) in Stockholm[1][3]. He was appointed to this position in 1931[3]. 

The Royal Institute of Technology, where Asplund taught, is one of Sweden's leading technical universities. Asplund's appointment as a professor there was a significant recognition of his expertise and influence in the field of architecture.

Upon his appointment, Asplund delivered a notable lecture titled "Our architectonic concept of space," which was later published and became an important contribution to architectural theory of the time[3]. This lecture reflected Asplund's thoughts on the architectural challenges and concepts of his era, demonstrating his role not just as a practicing architect but also as a theorist and educator.

Asplund's teaching position at the Royal Institute of Technology allowed him to influence and shape the next generation of Swedish architects, contributing to his lasting impact on Swedish and Nordic architecture.
