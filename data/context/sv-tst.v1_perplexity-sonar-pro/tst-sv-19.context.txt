Max Carl Wilhelm Weber was the first to scientifically describe the fish species Pseudomugil gertrudae in 1911[2][5]. Weber was a Professor of Zoology at the University of Amsterdam[3]. He described the species based on specimens collected from Trangan Island in the Aru Islands[2]. The species was named "gertrudae" in honor of Gertrude, the wife of Dr. Hugo Merton, a German naturalist who had visited the Aru Islands between October 1907 and August 1908[2][3].
