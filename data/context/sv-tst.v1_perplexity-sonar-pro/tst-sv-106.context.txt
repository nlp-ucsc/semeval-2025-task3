Paul Egede lived from September 9, 1708 to June 6, 1789[1]. Based on these dates, we can calculate that Paul Egede was 80 years old when he died.

Paul Egede, also known as Poul Hansen Egede, was a Dano-Norwegian theologian, missionary, and scholar who made significant contributions to the Lutheran mission in Greenland and to the study of the Greenlandic language[1]. He was born in Kabelv√•g, Norway, and followed in his father Hans Egede's footsteps in missionary work among the Kalaallit people of Greenland[1].

Throughout his long life, Egede accomplished many notable achievements:

1. He assisted his father in the Greenland mission and later took over as superintendent.
2. He translated the New Testament into Kalaallisut (West Greenlandic).
3. He published a Kalaallisut-Danish-Latin dictionary in 1750.
4. He wrote a Kalaallisut grammar, published in 1760.
5. He became a professor of theology at the Greenland Mission Seminary in 1747.
6. In 1779, he was elevated to Bishop of Greenland.
7. In 1785, he was made a fellow of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters[1].

Paul Egede continued his work until the very end of his life, publishing his journal of his life in Greenland in the same year he died, 1789[1]. His long life of 80 years was dedicated to missionary work, scholarship, and the study and documentation of the Greenlandic language and culture.
