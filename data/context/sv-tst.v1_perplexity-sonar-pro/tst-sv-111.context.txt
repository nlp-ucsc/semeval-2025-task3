Bert Olmstead played as a left winger in the National Hockey League (NHL)[1][3]. He spent his 14-season NHL career playing for three teams:

1. Chicago Black Hawks (now Blackhawks)
2. Montreal Canadiens 
3. Toronto Maple Leafs

Olmstead was known for his physical play and playmaking ability as a left wing. He had his most successful years with the Montreal Canadiens, where he often played on a line with star players like Jean Beliveau and Bernie Geoffrion[3]. During his time with Montreal, Olmstead led the league in assists twice - in 1954-55 with 48 assists and in 1955-56 with a then-record 56 assists[3].

Olmstead was a key player during an era of dominance for the Montreal Canadiens, helping the team win four Stanley Cups (1953, 1956, 1957, 1958)[4]. He later won a fifth Stanley Cup with the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1962 in his final NHL season[4].

Throughout his NHL career, Olmstead was known as a tough, hard-working left winger who could both score and set up his teammates effectively. His combination of physical play and offensive skill made him a valuable asset on the left wing for the teams he played for during his successful NHL career.
