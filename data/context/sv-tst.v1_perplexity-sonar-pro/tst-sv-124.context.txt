International Klein Blue (IKB) was not actually patented, contrary to some common misconceptions. Here are the key details about the registration of IKB:

1. IKB was developed by French artist Yves Klein in collaboration with Edouard Adam, a Parisian art paint supplier, in the late 1950s[1][3].

2. On May 19, 1960, Klein registered the paint formula for IKB using a Soleau envelope at the Institut national de la propriété industrielle (INPI) in France[1]. 

3. A Soleau envelope is not a patent, but rather a method under French law to establish the date of invention prior to any patent application. It does not confer intellectual property rights[1][4].

4. The Soleau envelope registration number for IKB was 63471[1][2].

5. Klein never actually patented IKB. The registration only established the date of invention according to Klein's claim[1].

6. The INPI's copy of the Soleau envelope was destroyed in 1965. Klein's personal copy, which was returned to him stamped by INPI, still exists[1].

7. What made IKB unique was not the color itself, but the binding medium that allowed the ultramarine pigment to retain its intensity and luminosity[3][4].

So to directly answer the query - International Klein Blue was not patented, but it was registered via Soleau envelope on May 19, 1960. This registration established Klein's claim to the invention date, but did not grant him exclusive rights to the formula or color.
