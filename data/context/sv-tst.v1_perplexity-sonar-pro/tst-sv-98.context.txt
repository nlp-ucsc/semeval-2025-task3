The last film Frances Farmer appeared in was "The Party Crashers" in 1958[1]. This was her final film role before she retired from acting in movies. After this film, Farmer mainly focused on hosting her own television series called "Frances Farmer Presents" and occasionally performing in local theater productions at Purdue University in the 1960s[1][7].
