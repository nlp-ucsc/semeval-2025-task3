Based on the search results provided, we can piece together the following information about the baptisms of Sven Tveskägg and Harald Blåtand:

Harald Blåtand:

Harald Blåtand's baptism likely occurred in the 960s, specifically around 963[1]. This timing is supported by several factors:

1. Harald married Tofa, daughter of the Christian Obodrite prince Mistivoj, around 963. It's likely Harald was already Christian or converted at this time, given his father-in-law's faith[1].

2. The construction of pagan burial mounds at Jelling in 958-959 and shortly after 963 suggests Harald was not yet Christian during this period[1].

3. The famous Jelling runestone, which declares Harald made the Danes Christian, was erected after these burial mounds, indicating his conversion occurred sometime after 963[1].

Sven Tveskägg:

Sven Tveskägg was baptized as a child, with the German Emperor Otto serving as his godfather[3]. This baptism likely occurred during Harald Blåtand's reign, after Harald's own conversion to Christianity. However, the exact date is not provided in the search results.

Interestingly, despite being baptized as a child, Sven Tveskägg reportedly returned to paganism as an adult[3]. Adam of Bremen states that Sven abandoned Christianity when he reached adulthood and rebelled against his Christian father, Harald Blåtand[3].

It's worth noting that the baptisms of both Harald Blåtand and Sven Tveskägg were significant events in the Christianization of Denmark. Harald Blåtand is credited with making the Danes Christian, as stated on the Jelling runestone[1][2], while Sven Tveskägg's early baptism and later rejection of Christianity illustrate the complex religious dynamics of the period.
