Geoffroi de Villehardouin participated in the Fourth Crusade (1201-1204)[1][4][7]. He was one of the key leaders and chroniclers of this crusade, which ultimately resulted in the conquest of Constantinople rather than reaching the Holy Land as originally intended.

Key points about Villehardouin's involvement in the Fourth Crusade:

1. Joining the Crusade: He took the cross in 1199 at a tournament in Ecry-sur-Aisne, along with other nobles like Count Thibaud III of Champagne and Count Louis of Blois[3].

2. Leadership role: Villehardouin was appointed as one of the six envoys chosen to negotiate with Venice for ships to transport the crusaders[3][4]. 

3. Planning and negotiations: He played a significant role in the planning stages, including the selection of Venice as the embarkation point and the negotiations with Doge Enrico Dandolo[3][4].

4. Diversion to Constantinople: While Villehardouin doesn't explicitly state his position in his chronicle, it's believed he likely supported the controversial decision to divert the crusade first to Zara and then to Constantinople[7].

5. Military leadership: During the crusade, Villehardouin served as a military leader. He was particularly instrumental in leading the retreat from the Battle of Adrianople in 1205 after Emperor Baldwin I was captured by Bulgarian forces[7].

6. Chronicler: Villehardouin wrote a firsthand account of the Fourth Crusade titled "De la ConquÃªte de Constantinople" (On the Conquest of Constantinople), which is considered one of the most important historical sources for this period[4][7].

After the crusade, Villehardouin remained in the newly established Latin Empire, where he was granted the city of Messinopolis in Thrace and appointed Marshal of Romania (the Latin Empire)[1][7].
