According to the search results, Chengjiang had a population of 146,293 people in 2010[3]. This figure comes from the Wikipedia page on Chengjiang, which provides basic demographic information about the city.

It's worth noting that Chengjiang is a county-level city located in Yuxi prefecture-level city, in China's Yunnan province. The city is known for its significant paleontological importance, particularly the Chengjiang Fossil Site, which became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2012[7].

While the total population of Chengjiang was 146,293 in 2010, it's interesting to note that the core area of the Chengjiang Fossil Site itself is much less populated. The UNESCO World Heritage Site covers 512 hectares, and there is no permanent human habitation within its boundaries[7]. However, in the buffer zone surrounding the fossil site, there was one village with 454 inhabitants as of 2010[8].
