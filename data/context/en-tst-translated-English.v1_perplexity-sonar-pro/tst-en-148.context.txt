Karen Percy became a Member of the Order of Canada in 1988[1][4][5][6]. Specifically:

She was appointed as a Member of the Order of Canada on July 11, 1988 and invested (formally received into the Order) on November 8, 1988[9].

This appointment came shortly after her success at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, where she won two bronze medals in alpine skiing events (downhill and super-giant slalom)[1][5]. Her achievements at these Olympics, which were held in her home country of Canada, were a significant factor in her receiving this prestigious national honor at the young age of 21.

The Order of Canada is one of Canada's highest civilian honors, recognizing outstanding achievement, dedication to the community, and service to the nation[3]. Percy's appointment as a Member (C.M.) acknowledges her contributions to Canadian sports and her role as an ambassador for alpine skiing.
