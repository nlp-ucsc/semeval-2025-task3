Agistri is a small island located in the Saronic Gulf of Greece[1][2][4]. Here are some key details about its location:

- It is part of the Saronic Islands group (also called Argo-Saronic Islands)[2][4].
- Agistri is situated very close to the larger Saronic island of Aegina[2].
- The island lies between the prefecture of Attica (where Athens is located) and the eastern coast of the Peloponnese peninsula[5].
- It is approximately 55-60 minutes by high-speed ferry from the port of Piraeus in Athens[4][5].
- Agistri is considered one of the closest islands to Athens, making it a popular destination for quick trips from the capital[3][4].

The strategic location of Agistri in the Saronic Gulf contributes to its popularity as a tourist destination. Its proximity to Athens and other Saronic islands like Aegina makes it easily accessible for both day trips and longer stays[1][3]. The island's location also places it in a beautiful maritime setting, surrounded by the clear blue waters of the Aegean Sea, which adds to its appeal as a scenic and relaxing getaway[3][6].
