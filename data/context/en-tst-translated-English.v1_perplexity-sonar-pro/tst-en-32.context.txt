Air France Flight 296Q crashed on June 26, 1988 during a demonstration flight at an airshow in Habsheim, France[1][4]. The Airbus A320 aircraft was performing a low-altitude flyover when it descended too low and failed to climb in time, crashing into trees at the end of the runway[1][3]. 

Key points about the crash:

1. It occurred during a promotional flight showcasing the new Airbus A320[1].

2. The aircraft flew over the runway at an extremely low altitude of about 30-40 feet, much lower than the planned 100 feet[1][3].

3. As the pilots attempted to climb, the plane was too low and slow to clear the trees at the end of the runway[1][3].

4. The right wing struck trees, causing the plane to crash and catch fire[1][4].

5. Three passengers (two children and one adult) died in the crash, while most others survived with injuries[1][4].

6. The official investigation concluded the primary causes were flying too low, too slowly, with engines at idle, and applying go-around power too late[3][6].

7. There was controversy surrounding the crash, with the captain claiming aircraft system issues, though investigators found no evidence of malfunction[2][3].

8. This was the first fatal crash of an Airbus A320[4].

The accident highlighted issues with demonstration flights, pilot training on new aircraft systems, and the interface between automated systems and pilot control in critical situations[5][6].
