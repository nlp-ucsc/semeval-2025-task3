The Tucumán mountain finch (Poospiza baeri) belongs to the genus Poospiza[1][4][5]. This species was previously placed in the genus Compsospiza, but recent taxonomic revisions have moved it back to Poospiza[8]. 

The genus Poospiza is part of the tanager family Thraupidae and includes finch-like birds found in South American lowlands and the Andes mountains[4]. The Tucumán mountain finch is one of ten species currently recognized in this genus[4].

This classification has been adopted by several authoritative sources:

1. The International Ornithologists' Union (IOC) World Bird List
2. The South American Classification Committee (SACC)
3. The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World
4. The Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World

It's worth noting that taxonomic classifications can sometimes change as new research emerges. However, as of the most recent updates (2024-2025), the Tucumán mountain finch is consistently placed in the genus Poospiza across multiple taxonomic authorities[1].
