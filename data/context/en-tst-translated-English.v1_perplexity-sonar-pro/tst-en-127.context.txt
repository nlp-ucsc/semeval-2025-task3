Infiniti, a luxury vehicle division of Nissan Motor Corporation, manufactures the Infiniti G Line of cars[3]. The Infiniti G Line is a series of compact executive cars that were produced from 1990 to 2016 across four generations[2].

Some key points about the Infiniti G Line:

1. Manufacturer: The cars are manufactured by Infiniti, which is the luxury vehicle division of Nissan[3][4].

2. Origins: The Infiniti brand began on November 8, 1989, initially in North America[3].

3. Generations: There were four generations of the G Line[2]:
   - First two generations (P10 and P11) were sedans based on the Nissan Primera
   - Third generation (V35) and fourth generation (V36) were rebadged versions of the Nissan Skyline

4. Models: The G Line included various models over the years, such as:
   - G20 (1990-2002): Infiniti's entry-level luxury car in the United States[2]
   - G35 (2002-2007): Introduced in March 2002, shifting to a rear-wheel drive platform[2]
   - G37: A later iteration of the G Line

5. Production locations: While many Infiniti models are made in Japan, some are produced in other countries. For example, the QX50 and QX55 are made in Mexico[6].

6. Legacy: The G Line, particularly the G35, was crucial for Infiniti's success. The G35 won Motor Trend's Car of the Year in 2003 and outperformed competitors like the BMW 3 Series in Car and Driver's sport sedan comparison[5].

7. Current status: The G Line has been discontinued and replaced by newer models. For instance, the Q50 and Q60 are current Infiniti sedans that continue the legacy of the G Line[6].

In summary, while Nissan is the parent company, Infiniti, as Nissan's luxury division, is responsible for manufacturing the G Line of cars, which played a significant role in establishing Infiniti as a competitive luxury brand.
