El Al Flight 402 crashed on July 27, 1955, resulting in the deaths of all 58 people on board[1][2]. This included 51 passengers and 7 crew members[1][2]. The flight was en route from London to Tel Aviv via Vienna and Istanbul when it strayed into Bulgarian airspace and was shot down by two Bulgarian MiG-15 jet fighters near the town of Petrich[1][2].

The incident occurred during a period of high tension between the Eastern and Western Blocs during the Cold War. At the time, it was the deadliest crash involving a Lockheed Constellation aircraft[2].

The victims included people of various nationalities, including Israelis, British, South Africans, and others[1]. A memorial was later erected at the Kiryat Shaul Cemetery in Tel Aviv, where the victims were laid to rest[1]. Additionally, a moshav (a type of Israeli settlement) in the Lakhish region named Nir Ḥen was established in memory of the 58 victims, as ח״ן (the Hebrew letters for Ḥen) represents the number 58 in Hebrew numerals[1].
