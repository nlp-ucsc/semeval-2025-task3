Jonathan Carl Zenker formally introduced the Cladoniaceae family to science in 1827[1][4][6]. This introduction appeared in a publication edited by Karl Goebel[1]. Zenker's initial concept of the family included genera such as Baeomyces, Icmadophila, and Stereocaulon, which have since been reclassified into separate families due to advances in taxonomic understanding[1].
