The Second Council of Nicaea met in 787 AD[1][2][3]. This ecumenical council, also known as the Seventh Ecumenical Council, was convened by Emperor Constantine VI and his mother Empress Irene, who served as regent[1][3]. The council assembled on September 24, 787 in Nicaea (present-day Ä°znik, Turkey)[1][2].

The primary purpose of this council was to address the issue of iconoclasm and restore the veneration of icons in Christian worship[1][3]. This practice had been suppressed within the Byzantine Empire during the reign of Emperor Leo III (717-741) and officially banned by his son, Constantine V (741-775)[3].

Key details about the Second Council of Nicaea include:

1. Attendance: Between 258 and 335 bishops were present, with 308 bishops or their representatives signing the final acts[1][2][3].

2. Leadership: The council was presided over by Patriarch Tarasios of Constantinople, along with legates of Pope Adrian I[1][3].

3. Duration: The council held seven sessions in Nicaea, with an additional session (now considered a forgery) supposedly held in Constantinople[1].

4. Outcome: The council approved the veneration of icons, effectively ending the first period of iconoclasm in the Byzantine Empire[3][6].

5. Significance: This council is recognized as the last of the first seven ecumenical councils by both the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church[1][3].

The Second Council of Nicaea played a crucial role in shaping Christian doctrine and practice regarding the use of religious imagery, and its decisions continue to influence various Christian denominations to this day.
