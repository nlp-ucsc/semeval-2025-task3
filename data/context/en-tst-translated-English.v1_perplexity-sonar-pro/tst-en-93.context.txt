Lesser bamboo rats (Cannomys badius) are not endangered. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the lesser bamboo rat's conservation status as "Least Concern"[1][4]. This classification indicates that the species is not currently at risk of extinction.

Several factors contribute to the lesser bamboo rat's stable population:

1. Wide distribution: The species is found across multiple countries in South and Southeast Asia, including Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal, and Thailand[1].

2. Adaptability: While primarily associated with bamboo groves in mountainous areas, lesser bamboo rats can also inhabit woodlands, plantations, and even disturbed ground[1]. This adaptability allows them to thrive in various environments.

3. Abundance: In some areas, the species is considered abundant[1]. The overall population is estimated to be well over 100 million individuals[6].

4. Reproductive capacity: Females can produce litters of two to five offspring, becoming sexually mature at one year of age[1]. This reproductive rate helps maintain population levels.

Despite their "Least Concern" status, lesser bamboo rats do face some threats:

1. Hunting: They are hunted for food in some regions, as they have been a food source for humans for at least 1,000 years[6].

2. Agricultural conflicts: Farmers may consider them pests due to their habit of eating crop roots[6].

3. Habitat loss: While not currently a major threat, ongoing deforestation and land-use changes in their native range could potentially impact populations in the future.

It's worth noting that while the species is not endangered, continued monitoring of population trends and habitat conditions is important to ensure their long-term survival.
