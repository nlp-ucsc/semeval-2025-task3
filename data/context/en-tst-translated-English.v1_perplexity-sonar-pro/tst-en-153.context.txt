The Garajonay National Park is named after the rock formation of Garajonay, which is the highest point on the island of La Gomera at 1,487 meters (4,879 feet) above sea level[7]. However, the name "Garajonay" itself has a deeper origin rooted in local legend.

According to Guanche folklore, the name "Garajonay" comes from combining the names of two legendary lovers, Gara and Jonay[1][4][7]:

- Gara was a princess from La Gomera
- Jonay was a prince from the neighboring island of Tenerife

Their tragic love story bears similarities to Romeo and Juliet:

1. Gara and Jonay met and fell in love during a festival on La Gomera.

2. Their families opposed the union, especially after the Teide volcano on Tenerife erupted, which was seen as a bad omen.

3. The lovers were separated, with Jonay sent back to Tenerife.

4. Jonay eventually swam back to La Gomera to reunite with Gara.

5. Pursued by their families, the couple fled to the highest point on the island.

6. Rather than be separated, they chose to end their lives together, reportedly by piercing their hearts with a wooden stick made from a cedar or heather branch.

This legendary peak where the lovers met their fate became known as Garajonay, combining their names. The national park, established in 1981, took its name from this significant geographical and cultural landmark[1][4][7].

The legend of Gara and Jonay is deeply ingrained in the cultural heritage of La Gomera and the Canary Islands. It not only gives the park its name but also adds a layer of romantic mysticism to the natural beauty of the area, making Garajonay National Park a place where nature and local lore are intertwined.
