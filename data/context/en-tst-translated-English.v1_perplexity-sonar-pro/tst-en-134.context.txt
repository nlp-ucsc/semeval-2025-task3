No, Yushu is not the largest city in Qinghai. The largest and capital city of Qinghai province is Xining[1][3][5][7].

To provide more context:

1. Xining is the capital and most populous city of Qinghai province[5]. As of the 2020 census, Xining had a population of 2,467,965 inhabitants[5].

2. Xining is also the largest city on the Tibetan Plateau[3][5].

3. In contrast, Yushu is a smaller city in Qinghai province. It is a county-level city of Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Southern Qinghai[2].

4. Yushu's population is significantly smaller than Xining's. As of 2020, the metropolitan area of Yushu had a population of around 356,000 people[2][4].

5. Yushu is actually considered the fourth largest city in Qinghai province[2][4].

6. To put this in perspective, other cities in Qinghai, such as Golmud and Haidong, have larger populations than Yushu[9].

In summary, while Yushu is an important city in Qinghai, particularly for the Tibetan population and culture in the region, it is not the largest city in the province. That distinction belongs to Xining, which serves as both the capital and the most populous city in Qinghai.
