Laurance Rockefeller had four children with his wife Mary French:

1. Laura Rockefeller Chasin
2. Marion Rockefeller Weber 
3. Dr. Lucy R. Waletzky
4. Laurance S. "Larry" Rockefeller Jr.[1][2][3]

Laurance and Mary were married in 1934 and had three daughters and one son[1][2]. Their children went on to have families of their own, with Laurance Rockefeller having eight grandchildren and twelve great-grandchildren by the time of his death in 2004[1].

The Rockefeller children were raised with the family's values of philanthropy, conservation, and social responsibility. Laurance Rockefeller described his marriage to Mary as a "partnership" with "parallel careers," and they were both heavily involved in each other's business and philanthropic endeavors[2].

Their son, Laurance "Larry" Rockefeller Jr., followed in his father's footsteps in environmental advocacy, becoming an environmental lawyer who worked for 25 years with the Natural Resources Defense Council[6].
