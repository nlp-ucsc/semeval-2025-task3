Yes, there were several other Kalanga-speaking kingdoms aside from the kingdom of Great Zimbabwe. The Kalanga people established and ruled multiple powerful states in southern Africa over the centuries. Some of the major Kalanga kingdoms include:

1. The Kingdom of Mapungubwe (c. 1075-1220 CE): This was one of the earliest Kalanga states, located at the confluence of the Shashe and Limpopo rivers[1][10]. Mapungubwe is considered the precursor to the Zimbabwe culture and was a center of early Kalanga civilization.

2. The Torwa State (c. 1450-1685): After the decline of Great Zimbabwe, the center of power shifted westward to Khami, where the Torwa dynasty established a new Kalanga state[2]. The Torwa rulers, known as Mambo Chibundule or Sipundule, governed a prosperous kingdom from Khami for over two centuries.

3. The Rozvi/Changamire Empire (c. 1685-1830s): Following the fall of the Torwa State, the Rozvi (also known as Lozvi or Nyayi) established a new Kalanga kingdom[2]. The Changamire dynasty ruled over a large territory, repelling Portuguese incursions and maintaining control over gold-mining areas[1].

4. The Kingdom of Butua: This was another name for the Kalanga state centered at Khami, which existed both under Torwa and early Rozvi rule[1][2]. It was a highly stratified society with a complex system of governance.

5. The Monomotapa (Mwene Mutapa) Kingdom: While often associated with the Shona, some sources suggest that the early rulers of this state were Kalanga-speaking[4][5]. The kingdom controlled a vast territory from the Zambezi to the Limpopo rivers.

These Kalanga states were known for their sophisticated political organizations, extensive trade networks, and impressive stone architecture. They controlled much of the gold production and trade in southern Africa for centuries. The Kalanga established what some historians consider to be the greatest kingdoms in Africa south of the Sahara, both in terms of power, wealth, and territorial expanse[4][5].

It's important to note that the history of these kingdoms is complex, with periods of overlapping rule and shifting power centers. The Kalanga influence extended beyond these major states, with their language and culture impacting a wide area of southern Africa, including parts of present-day Zimbabwe, Botswana, and South Africa[1][6][7].
