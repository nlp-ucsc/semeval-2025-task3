Le Mesnil-Opac was merged with Moyon Villages on January 1, 2016[1][3][8]. On this date, Le Mesnil-Opac became a delegated commune within the newly created commune of Moyon Villages, along with two other former communes:

1. Chevry
2. Moyon (which became the seat of the new commune)

This merger was part of a broader administrative reorganization in France, where smaller communes were combined to form larger administrative units. As a result of this merger, Le Mesnil-Opac lost its status as an independent commune and became part of the larger Moyon Villages commune while retaining some administrative functions as a delegated commune[4].
