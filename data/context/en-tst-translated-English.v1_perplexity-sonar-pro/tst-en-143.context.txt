Domantas Sabonis started his professional basketball career in Spain[4]. Specifically:

1. Rather than playing high school basketball in the United States, Sabonis signed with Spanish club Unicaja Málaga[4].

2. He made his debut for Unicaja at the young age of 16, becoming the youngest player to debut for the club in the Spanish league[4].

3. Sabonis played for Unicaja Málaga during the 2013-14 season, appearing in 35 games and averaging 2.7 points and 2.2 rebounds per game[7].

4. He was the youngest Unicaja player to debut in the ACB (the top-tier professional basketball league in Spain) at 17 years, 5 months, and 10 days old[7].

After his time in Spain, Sabonis moved to the United States to play college basketball for Gonzaga University before entering the NBA draft in 2016[2]. This early professional experience in Spain helped shape Sabonis' development as a player before he transitioned to the American basketball system.
