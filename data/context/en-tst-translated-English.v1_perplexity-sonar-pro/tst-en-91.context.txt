The British commander during the Battle of Long Island was General William Howe[1][4][5]. Howe led the British and Hessian forces against the American troops commanded by General George Washington[5].

General William Howe arrived off the coast of New York in early July 1776 with a fleet of 400 ships and an army of 32,000 men[10]. He landed his troops on Staten Island and began planning the attack on the American positions in Brooklyn.

On August 22, 1776, Howe began landing his forces on Long Island[1][2]. He personally led the main body of troops in a flanking maneuver through the unguarded Jamaica Pass on the night of August 26-27, which proved to be a decisive tactical move[7].

During the battle on August 27, Howe's strategy of dividing his forces into three columns and outflanking the American positions led to a significant British victory[4][7]. His troops inflicted over 2,000 casualties on the Americans and forced Washington to retreat[4].

Despite this initial success, Howe has been criticized by some historians for not immediately pursuing the retreating American forces. His decision to pause for two days after the battle allowed Washington to successfully evacuate his remaining troops from Long Island to Manhattan on the night of August 29-30[7].

For his victory at the Battle of Long Island, General William Howe was knighted and made a member of the Order of the Bath[4].
