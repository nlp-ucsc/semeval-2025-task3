19521 Chaos was discovered on November 19, 1998 by the Deep Ecliptic Survey using Kitt Peak's 4-meter telescope[1][4][6]. The Deep Ecliptic Survey was a project aimed at discovering and characterizing objects in the outer Solar System, particularly in the Kuiper Belt region.

Some key details about the discovery and characteristics of 19521 Chaos:

1. Discovery team: The asteroid was found by astronomers Robert L. Millis, Marc W. Buie, Mark Wagner, and James L. Elliot as part of the Deep Ecliptic Survey[3].

2. Location: It was discovered at Kitt Peak Observatory near Sells, Arizona[3].

3. Classification: 19521 Chaos is classified as a cubewano, which is a type of Kuiper Belt object that is not in orbital resonance with Neptune[6].

4. Size: It is estimated to be quite large for a Kuiper Belt object, with a diameter of approximately 560 km[1][4].

5. Orbit: Chaos has an orbital period of about 309-313 years, with estimates varying slightly between sources[1][6][8].

6. Naming: It is named after the primordial state of existence in Greek mythology, from which the first gods were said to have emerged[1][4].

The discovery of objects like 19521 Chaos has significantly contributed to our understanding of the outer Solar System and the population of bodies beyond Neptune's orbit.
