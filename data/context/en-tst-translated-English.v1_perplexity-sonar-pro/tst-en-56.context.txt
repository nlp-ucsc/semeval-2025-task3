Cedric Liddell won an Olympic bronze medal for rowing in 1932[1][4]. As a member of the Canadian men's eight rowing team, Liddell competed at the 1932 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles[1]. The Canadian crew, which included Liddell, captured the bronze medal in the eights competition[1][4]. This achievement was a significant accomplishment for Canadian rowing at the time.

The 1932 Canadian men's eight rowing team consisted of Albert Taylor, Donald Boal, William Thoburn, Cedric Liddell, Harry Fry, Stanley Stanyar, Joe Harris, Earl Eastwood, and coxswain Les MacDonald[8][9]. They represented the Leander Boat Club from Hamilton, Ontario[8]. 

In a closely contested final race, the Canadian crew edged out the British team by just four-tenths of a second to secure the bronze medal[8]. The United States won gold, and Italy took silver, with all four boats finishing within three seconds of each other[8].

This Olympic success was part of a strong period for the Leander men's eight crew. They had previously won a bronze medal at the 1930 British Empire Games in Hamilton[8]. Following their Olympic performance, the crew continued to excel, winning five Royal Canadian Henley Regatta Championships in the 1930s[8].

Cedric Liddell went on to compete again in the eights competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin[1][4], though the team did not medal in that event, finishing in 9th place[4].
