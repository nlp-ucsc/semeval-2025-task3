Sergei Parajanov, a pioneering Soviet filmmaker, was influenced by and drew inspiration from several notable filmmakers and artists:

1. Andrei Tarkovsky: Parajanov's shift away from Socialist Realism was significantly inspired by Tarkovsky's film "Ivan's Childhood" (1962)[2]. This film motivated Parajanov to abandon his earlier conventional style and explore new aesthetic directions.

2. Alexander Dovzhenko: As a precursor to Parajanov, Dovzhenko's unique approach to landscape and poetic blending of past and present in films like "Zvenigora" (1928) and "Earth" (1930) set him apart from other Soviet filmmakers and likely influenced Parajanov's style[5].

3. Igor Savchenko: Parajanov studied under Savchenko at film school in Moscow. Savchenko, known for the musical "Accordion" (1934), may have influenced Parajanov's early work[5].

4. Sergei Eisenstein: While not directly mentioned as an influence, Eisenstein's work, particularly the delayed release of "Ivan the Terrible Part II" with its striking color sequences, was part of the context of visual expressivity in Soviet film that Parajanov emerged from[5].

5. Niko Pirosmani: Though not a filmmaker, this Georgian primitive painter was greatly admired by Parajanov. Parajanov even made a short film about him in 1985, suggesting Pirosmani's naive, magical art style influenced Parajanov's approach[5].

6. Federico Fellini, Jean-Luc Godard, and Michelangelo Antonioni: While these filmmakers were Parajanov's contemporaries rather than direct influences, they were part of the international cinema scene that recognized and supported Parajanov's work, potentially creating a reciprocal influence[3].

It's worth noting that Parajanov developed a highly unique and personal style that, while inspired by others, was distinctly his own. He famously said, "Whoever tries to imitate me is lost," indicating his commitment to originality in his artistic vision[1][8].
