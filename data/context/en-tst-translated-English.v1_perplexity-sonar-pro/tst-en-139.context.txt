Hugh Fraser played the role of the Duke of Wellington in the "Sharpe" television series[2]. He took over this role from David Troughton and appeared in multiple episodes of the series[2]. 

The "Sharpe" series, which starred Sean Bean in the titular role, was a historical war drama set during the Napoleonic Wars. Fraser's portrayal of the Duke of Wellington, who was a prominent British military and political figure of the time, was a recurring and significant character in the series.

Fraser appeared in 9 TV movies of the "Sharpe" series between 1994 and 2006[2]. His portrayal of Wellington added gravitas and historical authenticity to the series, complementing Sean Bean's performance as Richard Sharpe.

It's worth noting that this role was quite different from Fraser's more famous portrayal of Captain Hastings in "Agatha Christie's Poirot", demonstrating his versatility as an actor. The fact that he played both the aristocratic Wellington and the more modest Hastings shows his range in portraying characters from different social backgrounds.
