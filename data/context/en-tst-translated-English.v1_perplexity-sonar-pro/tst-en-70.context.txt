Sant'Isidoro a Capo le Case has two cloisters:

1. The small cloister (il piccolo chiostro), designed by Antonio Casoni in 1626[1][3]. This is also referred to as the Spanish Cloister, as it was originally built for the Spanish friars who first established the complex[3].

2. The Wadding cloister, named after Luke Wadding, an Irish Franciscan friar[1][3]. This larger cloister was commissioned by Wadding and built in 1630, about 10 years after the Spanish cloister[3].

The Wadding cloister features 17th century murals, specifically fresco cycles in its walks painted by Fra Giovanni Antonio Sguary from Padua, a Franciscan artist, in 1701[1][3].

These two cloisters form an integral part of the convent building, which surrounds them[1]. The presence of these cloisters reflects the typical architectural layout of monastic complexes in Rome during the 17th century, providing spaces for contemplation and community life for the resident friars.
