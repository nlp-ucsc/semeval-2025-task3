The Japanese era that came between Gen'ō and Shōchū was Genkō (元亨)[1][2][5]. This era spanned from February 1321 to December 1324, during the reign of Emperor Go-Daigo[2]. 

To provide more context:

1. Gen'ō (元応) era: 1319-1321
2. Genkō (元亨) era: 1321-1324
3. Shōchū (正中) era: 1324-1326

It's important to note that this Genkō era (1321-1324) should not be confused with another era of the same name that occurred later, from 1331 to 1334. The later Genkō era used a different character for "kō" (弘 meaning "wide" instead of 亨 meaning "go smoothly")[2].

Some key events during the Genkō era (1321-1324) include:

1. The death of Fujiwara-no Saionji Kinakira, the udaijin (Minister of the Right), in 1321.
2. The construction of a small chapel at Daikaku-ji, ordered by former Emperor Go-Uda in 1321.
3. Changes in the shogunate's leadership in Kyūshū and Kyoto.
4. The completion of the Genkō Shakusho (元亨釈書), the oldest extant account of Buddhism in Japan, in 1322[2].

This era was part of the larger Kamakura period in Japanese history, which lasted from 1185 to 1333[5].
