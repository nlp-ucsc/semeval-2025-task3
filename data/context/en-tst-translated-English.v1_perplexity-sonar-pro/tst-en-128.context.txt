The primary mascot of the University of Virginia Cavaliers is known as Cavman or the Cavalier. Here are some key details about the mascot:

Cavman is a costumed character that represents a Virginia Cavalier, inspired by the historical Cavaliers who were Royalists during the English Civil War[1][9]. The mascot first appeared as a costumed character in 1984 and became widely known as Cavman around 2000[7].

Characteristics of Cavman include:

- A large character head with a cartoonish, grinning face and dark goatee
- A blue suit with the Virginia sabre logo across the chest
- A cape, giant blue boots, and white gloves
- An appearance of masculinity with bulging arm and leg muscles[3]

In addition to Cavman, there are other mascot-related traditions at the University of Virginia:

1. The Cavalier on horseback: A student rides a horse into Scott Stadium before football games, leading the team onto the field[1][5].

2. Animated Cavman: "The Adventures of Cavman," an animated series featuring the mascot, plays on the videoboard before football games[4].

3. Historical mascots: The university previously had dog mascots named Beta and Seal in the 1920s-1940s[5].

4. Brief appearances: Other short-lived mascots included the 'Hoo (an orange-costumed character) in 1983 and 'Lil Hoo (an inflatable mascot) in the early 2000s[5][7].

It's worth noting that multiple students (typically 4-5) take turns portraying Cavman at various events, keeping their identities secret until graduation[7].
