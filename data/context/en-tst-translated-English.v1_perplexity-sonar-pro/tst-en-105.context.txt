The Julang-2 (JL-2) is a Chinese submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) that provides China with its first credible sea-based nuclear deterrent[1][2]. Here are the key details about the JL-2:

## Specifications and Capabilities

- It is a three-stage, solid-fueled missile with an intercontinental range of 7,200-8,000 km[1][2]
- Payload capacity of 1,050-2,800 kg[2]
- Can carry either a single 1 megaton nuclear warhead or 3-8 multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) warheads with yields of 20, 90, or 150 kilotons[1][2]
- Diameter of 2 meters and length of approximately 13 meters[2]
- Launch weight of around 42,000 kg[2]

## Development and Deployment 

- Developed as a naval variant of the land-based DF-31 intercontinental ballistic missile[1][2]
- First test launch occurred in 2001, with subsequent tests in following years[2]
- Entered operational service in 2015[2]
- Deployed on China's Type 094 Jin-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines[1][2]
- As of 2019, China had 48 JL-2 launchers deployed across four submarines, with additional submarines under construction[2]

## Strategic Significance

- Provides China with its first viable sea-based nuclear deterrent capability[1]
- Significantly enhances China's second-strike nuclear capabilities
- Has sufficient range to potentially reach Alaska and parts of the continental United States when launched from Chinese coastal waters[3][5]

The JL-2 represents a major advancement in China's nuclear forces, giving the country a more survivable nuclear deterrent and increasing its strategic reach. Its deployment on Jin-class submarines allows China to conduct deterrence patrols from more secure locations in the ocean, complicating potential adversaries' defense planning.
