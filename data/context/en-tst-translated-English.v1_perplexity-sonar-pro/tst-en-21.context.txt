Frazier's Olympic success came while he was a student-athlete at Arizona State University. He was 21 years old when he competed in the 1976 Olympics[4]. His performance as part of the gold medal-winning 4x400 meter relay team was particularly noteworthy, as it helped establish him as one of the top sprinters of his era.
