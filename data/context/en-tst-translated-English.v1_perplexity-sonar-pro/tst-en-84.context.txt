Yes, there is a notable museum in Altadena, California called The Bunny Museum. Here are some key details about this unique attraction:

The Bunny Museum was dedicated to rabbits and first opened to the public in 1998 in Altadena, California[1]. Prior to 2025, it held over 35,000 rabbit-related items across 16 galleries in a 7,000 square foot space[1]. The museum's collection included ceramic rabbits, rabbit antiquities, stuffed rabbits, cookie-jar rabbits, Rose Parade float rabbits, freeze-dried rabbits, and more[1].

Some interesting facts about The Bunny Museum:

- It held the Guinness World Record for "owning the most bunny items in the world" since 1999[1].
- The museum's slogan was "The Hoppiest Place in the World"[1].
- It was co-founded by married couple Candace Frazee and Steve Lubanski, who started collecting rabbit-themed items as a daily gift-giving tradition[1][2].
- The museum relocated from Pasadena to larger premises in Altadena in 2017[1][2].
- Admission was $12 as of 2019, and it was open seven days a week[5].

Unfortunately, the museum's building, original collection, and exhibits were destroyed by the Eaton Fire in January 2025[1][6]. However, the live animals were safely evacuated, and the founders announced their intention to rebuild the museum[1][6].
