David F. Sandberg was born in Jönköping, Sweden on January 21, 1981[1][2][3]. Jönköping is a city located in southern Sweden, and it's where Sandberg spent his early years and began his journey into filmmaking[5].

As a child growing up in Jönköping, Sandberg developed a passion for movies and started making his own amateur films using his father's VHS camera[1]. He attended multiple grade schools in the city, including Torpa School, where he met his future wife, Lotta Losten[1].

Sandberg's early experiences in Jönköping played a crucial role in shaping his career. He worked at a local video store as a teenager, which not only allowed him to save money for his own camera but also provided him with an informal film education through exposure to various movies[3]. Additionally, he took an internship at a local film center in Jönköping called Film I Jönköping, where he began working on short films and honed his skills[1][3].

It was in this Swedish city that Sandberg laid the foundation for his future success as a filmmaker, eventually leading to his breakthrough in Hollywood with horror films like "Lights Out" and "Annabelle: Creation," as well as the superhero comedy "Shazam!"[3][6].
