There are 22 species of Agastache[1][2]. Agastache is a genus of aromatic flowering herbaceous perennial plants in the family Lamiaceae. The majority of these species are native to North America, with one species native to eastern Asia[1].

The genus Agastache is divided into two main sections:

1. Section Agastache (also known as Giant Hyssops):
   This section includes species that are found in western to central North America, extending across the Bering Strait into East Asia. Some notable species in this section include:
   - Agastache foeniculum (anise hyssop)
   - Agastache rugosa (Korean mint or wrinkled giant hyssop)
   - Agastache nepetoides (yellow giant hyssop)
   - Agastache scrophulariifolia (purple giant hyssop)

2. Section Brittonastrum (commonly called Hummingbird Mints):
   This section is primarily found in southwestern North America, with the highest diversity in the uplands of northern Mexico. Some species in this section include:
   - Agastache cana (Texas hummingbird mint)
   - Agastache rupestris (threadleaf giant hyssop)
   - Agastache aurantiaca (orange hummingbird mint)
   - Agastache mexicana (Mexican giant hyssop)

These Agastache species vary in their characteristics, including flower color, size, and native habitats. They are known for their aromatic foliage and attractive flowers that are often favored by pollinators, especially hummingbirds[1][3]. The plants in this genus are valued for their ornamental qualities in gardens and their potential use in herbal teas and traditional medicine[2].
