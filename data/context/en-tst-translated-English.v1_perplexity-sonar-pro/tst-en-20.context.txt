Kyle Korver did surpass Steve Kerr's three-point shooting percentage in certain aspects, but the comparison is nuanced:

1. Single-season record: Kyle Korver holds the NBA record for the highest three-point shooting percentage in a single season. In the 2009-10 season, Korver shot an impressive 53.6% from beyond the arc[1][6]. This surpassed any single-season performance by Steve Kerr.

2. Career three-point percentage: Steve Kerr maintains the edge in career three-point shooting percentage. Kerr finished his NBA career with a 45.4% three-point shooting percentage[5], which is slightly higher than Korver's career 42.9%[3].

3. Consistency: Korver led the league in three-point percentage four different times throughout his career[3], demonstrating remarkable consistency over a longer period. Kerr, while an excellent shooter, did not lead the league as many times.

4. Volume: Korver attempted and made significantly more three-pointers over his career compared to Kerr. This is partly due to the evolution of the NBA game, which increasingly emphasized three-point shooting during Korver's era.

5. Longevity: Korver played 17 seasons in the NBA compared to Kerr's 15, maintaining a high level of three-point shooting proficiency for a longer period[1][5].

In summary, while Steve Kerr holds the edge in career three-point percentage, Kyle Korver surpassed him in terms of single-season performance and overall impact as a three-point shooter, largely due to the changing nature of the NBA game during his career.
