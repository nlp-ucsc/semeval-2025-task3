The mother of the Aloadae was Iphimedeia (also spelled Iphimedia or Iphimede)[1][2][3]. Iphimedeia was the wife of Aloeus, but she was in love with Poseidon[2]. According to the myth, she would often walk to the seashore and collect seawater in her lap, which led to her becoming pregnant by Poseidon[1][2].

Some key details about Iphimedeia and her connection to the Aloadae:

1. Lineage: She was a daughter of Triopas[2].

2. Marriage: She was married to Aloeus, but her sons were fathered by Poseidon[1][2][3].

3. Children: Her sons with Poseidon were the giants Otus and Ephialtes, collectively known as the Aloadae[1][2][3]. She also had a daughter named Pancratis (or Pancrato)[1][2].

4. Myth: Iphimedeia's love for Poseidon led her to frequently visit the sea, where she would collect water in her lap, resulting in her pregnancy[1][2].

5. Abduction: In some versions of the myth, Iphimedeia and her daughter Pancratis were abducted by Thracian pirates while celebrating the orgies of Dionysus on Mount Drius. They were rescued by the Aloadae[2][3].
