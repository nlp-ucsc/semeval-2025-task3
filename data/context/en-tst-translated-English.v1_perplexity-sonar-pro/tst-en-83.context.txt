Terrazzo is approximately 108 km (67 miles) from Venice[8]. The road distance between Venice and Terrazzo is slightly longer at 111.6 km (69.3 miles)[8].

If traveling from Venice Airport (VCE) specifically, the distance to Terrazzo is about 111 km (69 miles), with a road distance of 117.2 km (72.8 miles)[9].

It's worth noting that while this question asks about the physical distance between Venice and a place called Terrazzo, there may be some confusion with the term "terrazzo" itself. Terrazzo is also a type of flooring material that has strong historical ties to Venice:

- Terrazzo flooring originated in Venice, Italy in the 15th century[2]. 
- It was developed by Venetian workers as a low-cost flooring option in the 18th century[10].
- The technique involves using chips of marble, quartz, granite, or glass set in concrete and polished to create a smooth surface[2][3].
- Venetian terrazzo floors are renowned for their durability and decorative qualities, often featuring intricate designs and patterns[2][5].

So while there is a specific location called Terrazzo at the distance mentioned above, the term is more commonly associated with the flooring style that has its roots in Venice's architectural history.
