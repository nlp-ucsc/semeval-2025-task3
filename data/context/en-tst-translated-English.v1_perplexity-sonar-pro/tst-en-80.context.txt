Chuseok celebrations in South Korea typically last for three days[1][2][3]. This major mid-autumn harvest festival is centered on the 15th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar, but the holiday period includes the day before and the day after as well[3].

During this three-day period:

1. Many South Koreans travel from large cities to their hometowns to spend time with family and pay respects to their ancestors[1].

2. Families gather to perform ancestral memorial rites called Charye, visit ancestral graves (Seongmyo), and tidy up the burial sites (Beolcho)[1][6].

3. Traditional foods are prepared and shared, including songpyeon (rice cakes), jeon (Korean pancakes), and rice wine[2][6].

4. People engage in various traditional games and activities, such as Tuho (arrow throwing), Neolttwigi (seesaw jumping), and Yut Nori (a board game)[6].

It's worth noting that while the official holiday is three days long, many Koreans may take additional days off work to extend their holiday, especially if Chuseok falls close to a weekend[2]. This can result in a mass migration across the country, with up to 75% of the population traveling to ancestral hometowns[7]. The extended holiday period allows families ample time to reunite, perform traditional rituals, and celebrate the autumn harvest together.
