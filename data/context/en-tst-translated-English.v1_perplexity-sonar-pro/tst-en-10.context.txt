Yes, there is a limit to the number of terms one can serve as the Colombian president. Currently, presidents in Colombia are limited to a single four-year term[2][4].

This one-term limit was established through a constitutional amendment in 2015, which repealed previous changes made in 2004 that had allowed for two consecutive terms[4][5]. The history of presidential term limits in Colombia has undergone several changes:

1. From 1910 to 2005, presidents were limited to a single term[4].

2. In 2004, the Colombian Congress passed the Electoral Guarantees Law, which modified the Constitution to allow presidents to run for a second term[4].

3. This change allowed √Ålvaro Uribe and Juan Manuel Santos to serve consecutive terms in 2006 and 2014, respectively[5].

4. In 2010, the Constitutional Court of Colombia rejected a planned referendum that would have allowed presidents to run for three consecutive terms[4].

5. Finally, in 2015, a constitutional amendment was passed that reverted to the original one-term limit[4][5].

The current system aims to prevent the concentration of power and ensure a regular turnover in the country's highest office. This change reflects Colombia's commitment to democratic principles and the balance of power within its government structure[1][2].

It's worth noting that this limitation applies to consecutive and non-consecutive terms, meaning that once a person has served as president, they cannot be elected to the office again, regardless of the time elapsed since their previous term[5].
