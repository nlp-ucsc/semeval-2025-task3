The Groninger Museum in the Netherlands typically attracts between 200,000 to 300,000 visitors annually, making it the most visited museum in the province of Groningen[1][8][10].

Some specific visitor numbers reported over the years include:

- Since 2008, the museum has had between 173,000 to 292,000 visitors per year, with the exception of 2010 when it was closed for renovation[1].

- In 2016, the museum had approximately 290,000 visitors, which was one of its highest totals in recent years[1].

- The museum expected to end 2018 with about 235,000 visitors[4].

- A factsheet from 2021 stated that the Groninger Museum receives an average of 200,000 visitors each year[8].

- One source from 2017 also mentioned the museum gets about 200,000 visitors annually, with only about 10% coming from North America[10].

It's worth noting that visitor numbers can fluctuate based on factors such as special exhibitions, renovations, or global events. For example, the museum saw lower attendance in 2010 due to being closed for renovation from April to December of that year[1].

The Groninger Museum's consistent ability to attract hundreds of thousands of visitors annually underscores its significance as a cultural institution in the Netherlands, particularly in the northern region of the country.
