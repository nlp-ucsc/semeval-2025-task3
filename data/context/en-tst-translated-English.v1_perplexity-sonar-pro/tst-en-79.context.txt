The BMW X2 is exclusively assembled at the BMW Group Plant in Regensburg, Germany[1][2]. This facility is responsible for manufacturing both the second-generation BMW X2 and its electric counterpart, the BMW iX2, for global markets[1].

Some key details about the production of the BMW X2 in Regensburg:

1. Production capacity: The plant has increased its daily production capacity from 1,000 to 1,300 units to meet global demand for the new X2 models[1].

2. Electric vehicle production: By 2024, about one-third of the vehicles produced at the Regensburg plant are expected to be electric models like the iX1 and iX2[1].

3. Flexible manufacturing: The Regensburg plant utilizes a flexible production line that can manufacture different types of drivetrains on a single line, including internal combustion engines, plug-in hybrids, and fully-electric vehicles[4].

4. High-voltage battery production: The plant also produces high-voltage batteries for the electric models at a nearby facility on Leibnizstraße[1][4].

5. Investment and expansion: BMW Group is investing approximately €200 million into the Regensburg and Wackersdorf locations by the end of 2024 to support the production of these new models[1].

6. Production volume: In 2023, the Regensburg plant produced 238,301 vehicles, accounting for over 10% of BMW's total sales. With the launch of the new X2, production numbers for 2024 are anticipated to surpass the previous year[1].

The start of production for the new BMW X2 and iX2 models represents a significant step in BMW's electromobility strategy and showcases the company's commitment to flexible and efficient manufacturing processes.
