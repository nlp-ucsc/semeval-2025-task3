Lü Lin and Wang Tao won their Olympic gold medal in men's doubles table tennis at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona[4][7]. This was a significant achievement for the Chinese duo, who demonstrated their skill and teamwork on the international stage. 

Some additional details about their Olympic journey:

1. The 1992 Olympics marked Lü Lin's Olympic debut[4].
2. In addition to their gold medal performance in doubles, both players also competed in the singles event, with Wang Tao finishing in 5th place[1].
3. Their success continued in subsequent years, as they won the men's doubles title at the World Table Tennis Championships in both 1993 and 1995[7].
4. The pair competed together again at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, where they won a silver medal in the men's doubles event[4][7].

This gold medal performance in 1992 was part of a strong showing for China in table tennis at those Olympics. In addition to Lü and Wang's victory in men's doubles, Chinese players also won gold in women's doubles (Deng Yaping and Qiao Hong) and women's singles (Deng Yaping)[5][6].
