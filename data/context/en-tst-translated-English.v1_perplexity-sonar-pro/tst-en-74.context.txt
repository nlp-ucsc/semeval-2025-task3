HMY Britannia is permanently berthed at Ocean Terminal in Leith, Edinburgh, Scotland[1][2][3]. Leith is a historic port area located about 2 miles from Edinburgh's city center[8].

The exact location details are:

- Address: Ocean Drive, Leith, Edinburgh EH6 6JJ, United Kingdom[2]
- Phone: +44 131 555 5566[2]
- Coordinates: 55°58′56″N 3°10′38″W[3]

Visitors can access the Royal Yacht Britannia through the Ocean Terminal Shopping Centre. The entrance to the tour is specifically located on the Ground Floor of the shopping center[7]. For those using location apps, the What3Words address is "each.glee.served"[7].

Britannia has been berthed at this location since its decommissioning in 1997[4][5]. It was chosen as the permanent home for the yacht after a competition between UK cities to host the vessel[5]. The ship is now a popular tourist attraction, welcoming over 300,000 visitors annually[1][2][4].

The yacht's positioning in Leith coincided with a redevelopment of the harbour area and the advent of Scottish devolution[3]. While there was some controversy over the siting, with arguments that it should have been moored on the River Clyde where it was built, the Edinburgh location has proven successful as a visitor attraction[3].

For those interested in visiting, Britannia is easily accessible by various means of transportation, including local buses (routes 11, 22, and 35)[9], car (about a 20-minute drive from Edinburgh city center), or even bicycle, with bike racks available outside Ocean Terminal[7][8].
