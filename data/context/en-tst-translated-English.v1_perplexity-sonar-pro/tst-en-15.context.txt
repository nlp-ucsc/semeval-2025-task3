The Empreza Ferro Carril Além Parahyba railway operated from 1895 to 1939. Here are the key details about its history:

1. Founding and Mule-Drawn Era:
- The Empreza Ferro Carril Além Parahyba was founded in 1891[1].
- It inaugurated a 4 km mule-drawn tramway between Porto Novo and Saúde in 1895[1][2].

2. Electrification:
- The tramway was purchased by local industrialist Adão Pereira de Araújo on January 13, 1923[1].
- Electrification of the line began shortly after the purchase[1].
- The electric tramway was inaugurated on November 15, 1925[1].

3. Operations:
- The electric tramway maintained the same 4 km route as the previous mule-drawn system[1][2].
- It used meter gauge tracks and shared the main street with the steam railroad[1].
- The tramway had three 40-passenger open cars, likely built by Trajano de Medeiros in Rio de Janeiro[1].

4. Closure:
- The electric tramway ceased operations in 1939 following a fatal accident[2].

It's worth noting that while the tracks were still in existence as of the time the Wikipedia article was written, the tramway itself has not been operational since 1939[2].
