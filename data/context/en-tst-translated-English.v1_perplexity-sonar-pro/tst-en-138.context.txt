International Klein Blue (IKB) was developed by French artist Yves Klein in collaboration with a Parisian paint supplier named Edouard Adam in 1960[1][5].

Yves Klein, born in 1928 in Nice, France, was a prominent figure in post-war European art[1]. Throughout his career, Klein was deeply fascinated by color, particularly blue. His interest in blue began when he was captivated by the deep cerulean skies of the French Mediterranean[1].

In 1956, while on vacation in Nice, Klein started experimenting with a polymer binder to preserve the luminescence and powdery texture of raw ultramarine pigment[1]. This experimentation eventually led to the creation of International Klein Blue.

The development of IKB involved combining synthetic ultramarine blue pigment with a specific binding medium. Klein worked with Edouard Adam to create a mixture that combined the ultramarine pigment with a polyvinyl acetate resin mixed with alcohol[4]. This unique binding medium had the property of shrinking as it dried, which allowed the paint to retain the matte, velvety quality of dry ultramarine blue pigment[4].

What made IKB special was not that it was a new color, but rather a new medium for conveying an existing color[5]. The binding medium allowed the pigment to maintain its intense, vibrant blue color without the dulling effect that traditional binders like linseed oil or gum arabic would have[4][5].

Klein officially registered his formula for IKB in 1960 using a Soleau envelope, which is the official French method of establishing when someone first had an idea[5]. However, it's important to note that Klein did not patent IKB, contrary to popular belief. The registration only established the time and originator of the invention, not ownership of the color itself[5].

International Klein Blue became central to Klein's artistic work, featuring prominently in his monochromatic canvases and his famous Anthropometry paintings[4]. Klein saw IKB as more than just a color; for him, it represented a gateway to an immaterial realm and a means of expressing spiritual and cosmic ideas[1][3].
