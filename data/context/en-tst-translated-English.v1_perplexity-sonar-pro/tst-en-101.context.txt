Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! was written by Jack Moran and Russ Meyer[2]. Specifically:

- Jack Moran wrote the screenplay, credited as Jackie Moran[2][3].
- Russ Meyer developed the original story[2][3].

Russ Meyer was also heavily involved in other aspects of the film's creation. He directed the movie[1][2], produced it alongside Eve Meyer[1][3], and edited it as well[3]. Meyer's creative vision was central to the film, as he conceived the idea as a follow-up to his earlier movie Motorpsycho, deciding to make a film about "three bad girls" instead of the "three bad boys" featured in the previous work[2].

The collaboration between Moran and Meyer resulted in a script filled with outrageous dialogue and over-the-top scenarios, which have become hallmarks of the film's cult status[4]. Their writing captured the essence of Meyer's unique filmmaking style, blending exploitation elements with campy humor and exaggerated characters[1].
