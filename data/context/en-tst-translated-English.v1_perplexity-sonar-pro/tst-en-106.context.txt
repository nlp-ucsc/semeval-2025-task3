James Bond drives an Aston Martin V12 Vanquish in the 2002 film "Die Another Day"[1][2][3]. This was Pierce Brosnan's final outing as 007, and the Vanquish played a prominent role in the movie.

In the film, Q presents Bond with the Vanquish at MI6's secret London Underground station, showcasing its various high-tech modifications[1]. The car comes equipped with several special features, including:

1. Adaptive camouflage system (nicknamed "the Vanish")
2. Front-mounted heat-seeking missiles
3. Thermal imaging system
4. Target-seeking shotguns
5. Bulletproof body and windows
6. Ejector seat

The Vanquish is featured in a memorable chase sequence on a frozen lake in Iceland, where Bond battles the villain Zao, who drives a heavily armed Jaguar XKR[1][2]. During this scene, the car's various gadgets come into play, including the ejector seat which Bond uses to flip the car back onto its wheels when it's sliding on its roof[1].

For filming, seven V12 Vanquishes were supplied to the production[1]. Three were standard production cars used for close-ups and interior shots, while four were heavily modified for special effects and stunts[1][2]. These modified versions were rebuilt with four-wheel drive systems, smaller V8 engines, and other alterations to allow for the complex stunt work required for the ice chase sequence[1].

The Vanquish's appearance in "Die Another Day" continued the long-standing relationship between the James Bond franchise and Aston Martin, which has featured in numerous 007 films since the iconic DB5 first appeared in "Goldfinger" in 1964[3].
