Paul Egede was sent to do his missionary work in Greenland. He continued the mission work started by his father, Hans Egede, who is known as the "Apostle of Greenland"[3]. 

Paul Egede was born on September 9, 1708[4], likely in Greenland, as his father Hans Egede had arrived there with his family in 1721 to establish a mission[1][3]. Paul grew up assisting his father's missionary efforts among the Inuit people of Greenland.

In 1734, Paul returned to Denmark to study theology[3]. After completing his studies, he went back to Greenland in 1736 to continue the missionary work, taking over from his father who had returned to Denmark after the death of Paul's mother[1][3].

Paul Egede made significant contributions to the Greenland mission:

1. He built a mission house in Ilimanaq, Greenland in 1751, which still stands today and has been carefully restored[5][10].

2. He served as a missionary, tradesman, and scholar in Greenland, focusing on spreading Christianity among the Inuit population[4][10].

3. Like his father, Paul worked on translating religious texts into the Greenlandic language and studying Inuit culture[3].

4. He continued his missionary work in Greenland until 1740[3].

Paul Egede's efforts in Greenland were part of a larger Danish-Norwegian mission to the island, which aimed to re-establish colonial claims, spread Christianity, and potentially find remnants of earlier Norse settlements[1][3]. His work, along with that of his father, laid the foundation for the continued presence of the Lutheran church in Greenland.
