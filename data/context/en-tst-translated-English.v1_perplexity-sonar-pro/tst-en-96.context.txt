The original Police Academy movie was directed by Hugh Wilson[1][7]. This was Wilson's directorial debut in feature films[1]. He was hired to direct based on his success with the TV series WKRP in Cincinnati, even though he wasn't very familiar with comedy films of this genre at the time[1].

Some additional details about Hugh Wilson's involvement:

1. When initially hired, Wilson watched many comedies in this genre but found them discouraging. This led him to want to reduce the amount of crude humor in the script[1].

2. Wilson asked for and received the power to refine the original script written by Neal Israel and Pat Proft. He aimed to focus on "real laughter" rather than gratuitous sex and anti-establishment themes[1].

3. Wilson is credited as both the director and one of the screenplay writers for Police Academy, along with Neal Israel and Pat Proft[6].

4. The final script was actually a compromise between Wilson's more grounded approach and the original writers' raunchier version[3].

Police Academy was released on March 23, 1984[1]. It was produced by The Ladd Company and distributed by Warner Bros.[1][5]. The film was a significant commercial success, grossing $149.8 million worldwide against a budget of only $4.8 million[1].
