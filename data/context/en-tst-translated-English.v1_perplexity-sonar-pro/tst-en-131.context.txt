Gergely Kulcsár competed in javelin throw, which is a track and field event in athletics at the Olympic Games[1][2][4]. 

Kulcsár was a Hungarian javelin thrower who participated in four Olympic Games between 1960 and 1972[4]. He had a highly successful Olympic career, winning three medals:

1. Bronze medal at the 1960 Rome Olympics[1][4]
2. Silver medal at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics[1][4]
3. Bronze medal at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics[1][4]

In addition to his Olympic success, Kulcsár was a dominant figure in Hungarian javelin throwing. He was the first Hungarian man to throw beyond 80 meters and won 12 national titles in the event[1][4]. His personal best throw was 87.06 meters, achieved during the 1968 Olympics[4].

Kulcsár's contributions to Hungarian athletics extended beyond his competitive career. He served as the Olympic flag bearer for Hungary at three consecutive Games: 1964, 1968, and 1972[2][4]. After retiring from competition, he became a coach, guiding Miklós Németh to Olympic gold in javelin throw at the 1976 Montreal Olympics[1].
