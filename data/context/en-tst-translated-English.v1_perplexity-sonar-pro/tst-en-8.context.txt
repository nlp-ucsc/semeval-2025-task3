Cape Verde first participated in the Summer Olympic Games in 1996 at the Atlanta Olympics[1][5][7]. This marked the country's Olympic debut, with Cape Verde sending a delegation of four athletes to compete in athletics events[5]. 

The Cape Verdean team at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics consisted of:

1. Alfayaya Embalo (men's 100 meters)
2. Henry Andrade (men's 110 meters hurdles)
3. António Zeferino (men's marathon)
4. Isménia do Frederico (women's 100 meters)[5]

Since their debut in 1996, Cape Verde has participated in every subsequent Summer Olympic Games[1][7]. The country has consistently sent small delegations, typically ranging from 2 to 6 athletes per Games[7]. 

It's worth noting that while Cape Verde has been a regular participant in the Summer Olympics since 1996, the country has never competed in the Winter Olympic Games[1][7].

Cape Verde's participation in the Olympics came after the formation of its National Olympic Committee (Comité Olímpico Cabo-verdiano) in 1989. This committee received official recognition from the International Olympic Committee in September 1993, paving the way for the country's Olympic debut three years later[7].
