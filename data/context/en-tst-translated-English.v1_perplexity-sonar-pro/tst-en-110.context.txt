Yes, there was a year when the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role wasn't awarded. In 1980, no award was given out in this category[1]. Additionally, in 1981, the award was temporarily replaced with a gender-neutral category for Best Supporting Artist, with all four nominees that year being male[1].

To provide more context:

1. The BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role was first introduced in 1968, with Ian Holm being the inaugural winner for his role in "The Bofors Gun"[1].

2. Since its inception, the award has been presented 54 times to 48 different actors[1].

3. The interruption in 1980 and the change in 1981 represent the only significant breaks in the award's history since its establishment.

4. After 1981, the award returned to its original format of Best Actor in a Supporting Role and has been awarded annually since then.

5. The most recent winner, as of the information provided, is Robert Downey Jr. for his role in "Oppenheimer"[1].

This brief interruption in the award's history is an interesting anomaly in the otherwise consistent presentation of the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.
