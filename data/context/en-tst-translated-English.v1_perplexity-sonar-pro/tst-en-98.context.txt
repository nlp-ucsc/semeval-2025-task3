The denarius was first minted by the Romans in 268 BC[1][3]. This silver coin became the backbone of Roman currency throughout the Republican and early Imperial periods[3].

Some key details about the introduction of the denarius:

1. It was first struck at the temple of Juno Moneta in Rome[1].

2. The denarius contained approximately 4.5 grams of silver, which was 1/72 of a Roman pound[3].

3. Its name "denarius" means "containing ten," as it was initially valued at 10 bronze asses[3].

4. The denarius replaced earlier forms of Roman coinage, including the Greek-style silver didrachms that Rome had been using for trade with Greek cities in southern Italy[3].

5. Its introduction came just five years before the First Punic War, likely in response to Rome's growing economic and military needs[3].

6. The denarius featured designs typical of early Roman coinage - one side displayed the head of a deity, while the other showed the prow of a ship[1].

While some sources refer to coins minted slightly earlier as "heavy denarii," modern numismatists classify these as quadrigati, named after the four-horse chariot design on their reverse[3]. The true denarius as we know it was indeed first minted in 268 BC, marking a significant development in Rome's monetary system as the city-state began to expand its influence across the Italian peninsula and beyond.
