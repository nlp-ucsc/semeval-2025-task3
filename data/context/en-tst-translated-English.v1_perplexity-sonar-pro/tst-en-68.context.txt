Yes, there are definitely Fomitiporia species found outside of Africa. The genus Fomitiporia has a worldwide distribution[1]. Some examples of Fomitiporia species found outside Africa include:

1. In South America:
- Fomitiporia apiahyna, reported mainly from Brazil and other Neotropical countries[2].
- Fomitiporia neotropica, found in southern Brazil, central Argentina, and French Guiana[3].

2. In North America:
- Fomitiporia bakeri, reported from the USA[3].

3. In Asia:
- Fomitiporia bannaensis, found in Thailand[3].

4. In Europe:
- Fomitiporia punctata, which is found in temperate areas of Europe[4].

5. In Australia:
- Fomitiporia australiensis[3].

The genus is widely distributed across different continents and climatic zones. For instance, Fomitiporia punctata is mainly found in cool temperate areas, while Fomitiporia torreyae is more common in warm temperate regions[7].

It's worth noting that some species previously classified as Fomitiporia have been reclassified. For example, Fomitiporia ellipsoidea, which produced the largest known fungal fruit body and was found in China, has been reclassified as Phellinus ellipsoideus[4].

While there are certainly Fomitiporia species in Africa, with new species being discovered there[6], the genus is by no means limited to that continent. Fomitiporia species can be found in various forest ecosystems around the world, often playing important roles in wood decay processes.
