The deepest known cave on Earth is Veryovkina Cave, located in Abkhazia, a disputed region of Georgia[1][2][3]. Here are some key details about this remarkable cave:

## Depth and Location

Veryovkina Cave reaches a staggering depth of 2,212 meters (7,257 feet)[1][3]. It is situated in the Arabika Massif, part of the Gagra mountain range in the Western Caucasus[2]. The cave's entrance lies at an elevation of 2,285 meters (7,497 feet) above sea level[2].

## Discovery and Exploration

The cave was first discovered in 1968 and named after Alexander Verëvkin, a caver[1]. However, its true depth was only confirmed in recent years:

- By June 2016, explorers had reached a depth of 630 meters (2,070 feet)[2].
- In February 2017, the cave was explored to 1,832 meters (6,010 feet), making it the second deepest in the world at that time[2].
- In August 2017, the depth was measured at 2,204 meters (7,231 feet), setting a new world depth record[2].
- The current record depth of 2,212 meters was established in March 2018 when explorers measured the depth of the terminal siphon lake, named "The Last Nemo Station"[2].

## Cave Characteristics

Veryovkina Cave is characterized by:

- An entrance with a cross-section of 3 m × 4 m (9.8 ft × 13.1 ft)[2].
- An initial entrance shaft 32 meters (105 feet) deep[2].
- A series of vertical shafts and horizontal passages[4].
- A huge system of more than 6,000 meters (20,000 feet) of subhorizontal passages below the 2,100-meter depth[2].
- Challenging conditions including water-filled passages, tight squeezes, and the risk of flooding[4].

## Significance

Veryovkina Cave's exploration represents a significant achievement in speleology. It took about 30 expeditions over half a century for Russian cave explorers to reach its record depth[4]. The cave continues to be of interest to researchers studying underground ecosystems, geology, and hydrology.

It's worth noting that while Veryovkina is currently recognized as the deepest cave, cave exploration is ongoing, and new discoveries or connections between cave systems could potentially alter these rankings in the future.
