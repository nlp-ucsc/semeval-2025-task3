Delta, British Columbia was officially incorporated as a district municipality on November 10, 1879[1][2][5]. However, it's important to note that Delta's status as a "city" is more recent:

1. For most of its history, Delta was officially known as "The Corporation of Delta"[1][2].

2. In 2017, the municipal government initiated a process to change Delta's official classification from a district municipality to a city[2].

3. This change was finalized, and Delta officially became known as "The City of Delta"[5].

The transition to city status did not alter Delta's agricultural identity, municipal operations, or the community names of Ladner, Tsawwassen, and North Delta[2]. The change was primarily administrative and did not significantly impact the day-to-day lives of residents.

It's worth noting that despite being incorporated in 1879, Delta's history of European settlement dates back to the 1860s. The Ladner brothers, William Henry and Thomas Ellis, first settled in the area in 1868, recognizing its agricultural potential[3]. Prior to European settlement, the area had been inhabited by Indigenous peoples, particularly the Tsawwassen First Nations, for thousands of years[4].

Today, Delta remains an important part of the Metro Vancouver area, with a population of over 100,000 residents spread across its three main communities: North Delta, Ladner, and Tsawwassen[4].
