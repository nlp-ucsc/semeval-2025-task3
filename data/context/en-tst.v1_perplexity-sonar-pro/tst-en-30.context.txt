The Ukrainian karbovanets preceded the Ukrainian hryvnia, which is the current national currency of Ukraine[1][2][3].

The karbovanets was used in Ukraine during three separate periods in the 20th century before being replaced by the hryvnia:

1. First karbovanets (1917-1920): Used by the Ukrainian People's Republic and the Ukrainian State during Ukraine's brief period of independence following World War I[2].

2. Second karbovanets (1942-1945): Issued by the German occupying government during World War II[2].

3. Third karbovanets (1992-1996): Introduced after Ukraine gained independence from the Soviet Union[3][6].

The transition from karbovanets to hryvnia occurred in September 1996:

- On September 2, 1996, the hryvnia officially replaced the karbovanets as Ukraine's national currency[3].
- The exchange rate was set at 100,000 karbovanets for 1 hryvnia[3][7].
- A two-week transition period (September 2-16, 1996) allowed both currencies to circulate in parallel[3].
- By September 16, 1996, the hryvnia became the sole legal tender in Ukraine[3].

This currency reform was a significant step in stabilizing Ukraine's economy after the hyperinflation experienced with the karbovanets in the early 1990s following the dissolution of the Soviet Union[4][7].
