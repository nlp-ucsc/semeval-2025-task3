Frances Farmer was first interned in a psychiatric institution in January 1943. Specifically:

On January 13, 1943, Farmer was arrested after failing to pay a fine and for allegedly assaulting a studio hairdresser[9]. The next day, she behaved erratically in court, resulting in a 180-day jail sentence[9]. 

However, instead of serving jail time, Farmer was transferred to the psychiatric ward of Los Angeles General Hospital on January 21, 1943[9]. There, she was initially diagnosed with "manic depressive psychosis, probably the forerunner of a definite dementia praecox"[9].

Shortly after, with help from the Screen Actors Guild, Farmer was moved to the Kimball Sanitarium, a minimum-security psychiatric institute in the San Fernando Valley[9]. At Kimball, psychiatrists diagnosed her with paranoid schizophrenia and began administering insulin shock therapy[9].

Farmer would spend about nine months at the Kimball Sanitarium before escaping to her half-sister's house[9]. This marked the beginning of a long period of institutionalization, with Farmer spending most of the next seven years in various mental institutions[10].
