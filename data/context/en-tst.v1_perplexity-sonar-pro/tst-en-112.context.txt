John Edward Gray gave the spade-toothed whale the scientific name "Mesoplodon traversii" in 1874[1][3]. 

Specifically:

1. In 1872, naturalist Henry Travers found a partial jawbone and teeth of an unknown whale species on Pitt Island in New Zealand[3][7].

2. In 1873, James Hector, director of the Colonial Museum in New Zealand, initially identified this specimen as belonging to the strap-toothed whale (then called Dolichodon layardii)[1][7].

3. In 1874, British zoologist John Edward Gray examined Hector's description and concluded it was actually a new species[1][7]. 

4. Gray proposed the name "Dolichodon traversii" for this new species, naming it after Henry Travers who had collected the original specimen[1][7].

5. The genus name was later changed from Dolichodon to Mesoplodon, resulting in the current scientific name Mesoplodon traversii[1].

So while the species was first discovered based on Travers' specimen, it was Gray who formally named and described it as a distinct species in 1874, giving it the specific name "traversii" in honor of Travers[1][3][7].
