Paris Métro Line 8 opened on July 13, 1913[1][2]. Initially, the line ran between Beaugrenelle and Opéra stations[1][2]. Shortly after, on September 30, 1913, the line was extended from Beaugrenelle to Porte d'Auteuil[1][2].

Some additional details about the early history of Line 8:

1. It was the last line created under the original 1898 Paris Métro plan[2].

2. The line's construction faced some challenges, particularly with the underwater crossing of the Seine. Work on this section began in April 1908 and was completed in January 1911, after delays caused by the 1910 flood[2].

3. When it first opened, not all stations were complete. The Invalides and Concorde stations opened later, on December 24, 1913, and March 12, 1914, respectively[2].

4. By 1914, the line had fifteen stations between Porte d'Auteuil and Opéra[2].

Over the years, Line 8 underwent several extensions and modifications:

- In 1928, it was extended from Opéra to Richelieu-Drouot[2].
- A major extension to Porte de Charenton opened on May 5, 1931[1][2].
- In 1937, the southwestern portion was modified, with the section between La Motte-Picquet and Porte d'Auteuil transferred to Line 10, and Line 8 extended to Balard[2].

Today, Line 8 is one of the longest and busiest lines in the Paris Métro network, serving 38 stations along its 23.4 km (14.5 mi) route[2].
