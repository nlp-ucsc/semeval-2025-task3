Spotted blue-eyes (Pseudomugil gertrudae) are carnivorous fish with a preference for small live foods. Their diet consists of:

1. Live foods:
- Fresh Artemia nauplii (brine shrimp)[1][2]
- Cyclops[1]
- Daphnia[1]
- White mosquito larvae[1]
- Small invertebrates[5]

2. Frozen foods:
- Black mosquito larvae[1]
- Bloodworms[2]
- Brine shrimp[2]

3. Dry foods:
- High-quality flake food[2][6]
- Micropellets[3]
- Powdered fry foods (for juveniles)[3]

It's important to note that while spotted blue-eyes will accept quality dry foods, they have a strong preference for meaty foods[2][6]. To ensure optimal health and coloration, their diet should include a variety of food types:

- Offer small, frequent feedings of appropriately sized food particles, as they have small mouths[2].
- Supplement their diet with live or frozen meaty foods regularly[6].
- Include high-quality dry foods to ensure a balanced diet[2].

In the wild, spotted blue-eyes primarily feed on floating or suspended zooplankton, phytoplankton, and small invertebrates[5]. To mimic their natural feeding habits in an aquarium setting, it's beneficial to provide a mix of foods that float or can be suspended in the water column.

When keeping spotted blue-eyes with other fish species, be mindful that they are relatively timid eaters and may be outcompeted for food by more aggressive species[6]. Ensure that they receive their fair share during feeding times.
