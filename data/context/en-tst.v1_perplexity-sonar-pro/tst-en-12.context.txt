Based on the search results provided, there are no plants of the genus Abrus that are native to the Americas. The genus Abrus, including its most well-known species Abrus precatorius, is native to the Old World tropics. Specifically:

1. Abrus is native to tropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, the Arabian Peninsula, south and southeast Asia, southern China, New Guinea, and Australia[1].

2. Abrus precatorius, the most common and well-known species of the genus, is native to Asia and Australia[2][5].

3. Some Abrus species have been introduced to the tropical Americas, but they are not native to this region[1].

4. In fact, Abrus precatorius is considered an invasive species in many parts of the Americas where it has been introduced. It has become a problematic invasive plant in places like:

   - Florida, where it has invaded undisturbed pinelands and hammocks, including vulnerable pine rocklands[2][5].
   - Belize, Caribbean Islands, Hawaii, and parts of the mainland United States[5].

5. The plant's invasive nature in the Americas is further evidenced by its inclusion on the Federal Noxious Weed List in the United States, making it illegal to grow in some areas[3].

In summary, while Abrus species can now be found in various parts of the Americas, they are not native to this region. Their presence in the Americas is a result of human introduction, and in many cases, they have become problematic invasive species in these non-native habitats.
