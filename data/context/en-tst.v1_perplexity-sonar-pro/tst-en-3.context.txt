Andrei Kravchuk began working on "The Italian" in the early 2000s. The process started around 2000 when screenwriter Andrei Romanov approached Kravchuk with a newspaper article about an orphan who taught himself to read in order to find his birth mother[1]. This story inspired Kravchuk, who had previously made a short documentary about orphanages, to adapt it into a feature film.

The development of the film took several years. Kravchuk spent over a year scouring orphanages to find the right child actor to play the lead role[9]. This extensive casting process suggests that pre-production work on "The Italian" likely began in earnest around 2003 or 2004.

The film was completed and released in 2005. It premiered at film festivals and was selected as the Russian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 78th Academy Awards[4]. The film's release date is listed as September 22, 2005[4].

Given this timeline, it's reasonable to conclude that Andrei Kravchuk began serious work on "The Italian" sometime between 2000 and 2003, with the project taking shape over several years before its 2005 release.
