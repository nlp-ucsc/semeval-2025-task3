Yes, Zonitoides does use love darts during mating[4][6]. Zonitoides is a genus of land snails in the family Zonitidae that employs love darts as part of its courtship and mating behavior.

Specifically:

1. Zonitoides is mentioned as one of the genera that has a dart(-sac) and uses love darts during mating[3].

2. The Zonitidae family, which includes Zonitoides, is listed among the groups where calcareous love darts have been found[2].

3. Zonitoides arboreus, a species in this genus, is specifically noted to have a low-spired shell and use love darts, though its mating position is unknown[3].

4. The love darts in Zonitoides are calcareous (made of calcium carbonate)[4].

5. Zonitoides exhibits some unique mating behaviors compared to other dart-using snails. While most low-spired snail species that use darts mate face-to-face with reciprocal penis intromission, Zonitoides arboreus has unilateral penis intromission[3].

The use of love darts in Zonitoides, as in other snail species, likely serves to increase the chances of successful fertilization. The darts are thought to deliver hormones that influence sperm storage and usage in the receiving partner, potentially increasing the dart-shooting snail's chances of paternity[2][3].

It's worth noting that while Zonitoides does use love darts, the specific details of its mating behavior and dart usage may vary between species within the genus. More research may be needed to fully understand the nuances of love dart use across all Zonitoides species.
