Emperor Uda abdicated in 897[1][3]. Specifically:

Emperor Uda abdicated in favor of his eldest son, who became Emperor Daigo, on September 3, 897[1]. At the time of abdication, Emperor Daigo was only 13 years old[3].

After abdicating, Uda continued to exercise power as the retired emperor, known as "in no ch≈ç" in Japanese[1]. As a retired emperor, Uda remained influential in court politics. In 899, he succeeded in appointing his favorite, the renowned scholar Sugawara Michizane, to the important post of minister of the right (udaijin)[1].

Emperor Uda's abdication marked an important transition in Japanese imperial history. He advised the young Emperor Daigo to take counsel from both Sugawara Michizane and Fujiwara Tokihira in ruling the country[3]. This set the stage for political maneuvering between these two influential advisors in the subsequent years.
