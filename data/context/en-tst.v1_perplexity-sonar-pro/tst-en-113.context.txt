According to the official population statistics from INSEE (Institut National de la Statistique et des Études Économiques), the legal population of Valeille in 2020 was as follows:

- Population municipale (municipal population): 682 inhabitants
- Population comptée à part (population counted separately): 11 inhabitants
- Population totale (total population): 693 inhabitants[8]

The "population municipale" refers to the number of people who have their usual residence in the commune. The "population comptée à part" includes people who have a residence in the commune but are counted elsewhere (e.g., students living away from home). The "population totale" is the sum of these two figures.

It's worth noting that these figures, although labeled as 2020, actually came into effect on January 1, 2024. This is because INSEE uses a rolling census method and there is typically a delay between data collection and official publication of population figures[8].

For context, we can look at the population trend in Valeille:

- In 2015, the total population was 725 inhabitants
- In 2021, the total population was 693 inhabitants[8]

This shows that the population of Valeille has slightly decreased between 2015 and 2021, with the 2020 figure falling within this range.
