Quintus Fabius Vibulanus served as consul in 485 BC along with Lucius Cornelius[7][8]. Specifically:

1. Quintus Fabius Vibulanus held the consulship in both 485 BC and 482 BC[7].

2. The search results mention "Quintus Fabius Vibulanus and Lucius Cornelius Curitinus" as consuls, though the exact year is not specified in that particular result[8].

3. This aligns with the period from 485 BC to 479 BC when members of the gens Fabia dominated the consulship, with one of the two consuls being a Fabius each year[3][7].

It's worth noting that the Roman Republic typically had two consuls serving simultaneously each year. The naming of years after consuls, known as eponymous dating, was a common practice in ancient Rome[4]. This system of dating continued until the consulship was abolished by Justinian I in 541/542 AD[4].
