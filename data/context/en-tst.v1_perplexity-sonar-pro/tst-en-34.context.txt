Based on the search results provided, I don't have specific information about who was the first chairman of the Baptist Union of Norway. The search results don't contain details about the initial leadership of the organization when it was founded in 1879.

However, I can provide some relevant context about the early history of Baptists in Norway:

The Baptist Union of Norway (originally called "The Norwegian Baptists' Union") was established in 1879[1]. This organization was intended to strengthen unity among local Baptist congregations by providing common bodies and meeting places. It gave Norwegian Baptists central leadership to represent them at national and international levels[1].

The founding of the Baptist Union of Norway was an important event in the history of Baptists in the country. It helped strengthen the sense of affiliation and loyalty between congregations and shaped a common understanding of Baptist faith and practices[1].

The Baptist work in Norway was initiated earlier by Fredrik L. Rymker, a Danish sailor, who came to Norway in 1857 and began evangelizing and spreading Baptist teaching in the Grenland district[1]. The first Baptist church in Norway, called the "Baptist Church in Porsgrund and Solum" (now known as Skien Baptist Church), was founded on April 22, 1860 with nine members[1].

While I don't have information on the first chairman specifically, these details provide some context about the early leadership and organization of Baptists in Norway. If you need more specific information about the initial leadership, you may need to consult more specialized historical sources on Norwegian Baptist history.
