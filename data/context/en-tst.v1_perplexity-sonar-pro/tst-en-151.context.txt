Based on the available search results, there is no specific information provided about when filming for "Hit Man" began. However, we can piece together some relevant details about the film's production timeline:

1. The film is based on a Texas Monthly article from 2001, which Richard Linklater had read at the time of its publication[2].

2. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Glen Powell read the same article and contacted Linklater about turning it into a script. They co-wrote the screenplay remotely during this period[2].

3. The film was set to "Completed" status in September 2023[1].

4. "Hit Man" had its world premiere at the 80th Venice International Film Festival on September 5, 2023, followed by its North American premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2023[4].

5. The movie was originally planned to be filmed in Houston, Texas, but due to tax incentives, the production was moved to New Orleans, Louisiana[3][9].

Given these details, we can infer that filming likely took place sometime between the script's completion during the pandemic and before its premiere in September 2023. However, without more specific information from the production team or official sources, it's not possible to pinpoint the exact start date of filming for "Hit Man."
