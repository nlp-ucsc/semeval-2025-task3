Collage techniques can be traced back to ancient times, with the earliest examples dating to around 200 BCE in China[1][5]. This coincides with the invention of paper by Cai Lun, which provided a crucial material for early collage-like works[1].

While the modern concept of collage as we know it today emerged much later, several historical developments contributed to its evolution:

1. 10th century Japan: Calligraphers and poets used collage-like techniques, pasting words on various surfaces[1][5].

2. 10th-11th century Japan: The development of Chigiri-e (ちぎり絵), a technique involving tearing and combining pieces of dyed paper to create scenes[1].

3. 15th-16th century Europe: Collage-like methods were used to embellish gothic cathedrals by attaching metals and gems to religious artworks[1].

4. 19th century: The rise of scrapbooking popularized the use of collage techniques among hobbyists[1][5].

5. Early 20th century: The term "collage" was coined to describe the works of Cubist artists Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, who incorporated cut and pasted elements into their assemblages[1][2].

It's important to note that while these early examples share similarities with modern collage, the technique as we understand it today - involving the deliberate combination of various materials to create new artistic compositions - truly gained prominence in the early 20th century with the Cubist movement[4][6].

The evolution of collage has been continuous, with various art movements adopting and adapting the technique to suit their artistic visions. From Cubism to Dadaism, Surrealism, and eventually Pop Art, collage has remained a versatile and powerful medium for artistic expression[4][7].
