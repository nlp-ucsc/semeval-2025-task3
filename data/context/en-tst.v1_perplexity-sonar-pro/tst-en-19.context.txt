No, not all foods are red. Foods come in a wide variety of colors. Here's a brief overview of food colors and some examples:

Red foods are just one part of the nutritional spectrum. The concept of "eating the rainbow" encourages consuming foods of various colors to ensure a diverse intake of nutrients[1]. While red foods like tomatoes, strawberries, and red peppers offer specific health benefits, they are only one part of a balanced diet.

Other food colors include:

1. Green: Leafy vegetables, broccoli, green apples, kiwi
2. Yellow/Orange: Bananas, oranges, corn, squash
3. Blue/Purple: Blueberries, eggplant, purple cabbage
4. White: Cauliflower, potatoes, mushrooms
5. Brown: Whole grains, nuts, coffee

Each color group tends to offer different nutritional benefits. For example, green foods are often rich in folate and iron, while orange foods typically contain high levels of beta-carotene[1].

It's worth noting that while red is a common color in fast food branding due to its ability to grab attention and potentially stimulate appetite, this doesn't mean all foods are red[3]. In fact, blue is relatively rare in natural foods, which is why it's sometimes used in packaging to stand out[2].

The key to a healthy diet is variety, incorporating foods of all colors to ensure a wide range of nutrients. So while red foods certainly have their place in a balanced diet, they are just one part of the colorful world of nutrition.
