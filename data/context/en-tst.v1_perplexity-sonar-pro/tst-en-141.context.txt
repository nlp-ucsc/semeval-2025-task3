The Autonomous Province of Korçë, also known as the Republic of Korçë, was a self-governing entity established on December 10, 1916, in southeastern Albania during World War I[1][7]. It was created under French military protection after French forces occupied the city of Korçë. The autonomous province was governed by a 14-member Administrative Council, with equal representation of Christians and Muslims[7].

Key features of the Autonomous Province of Korçë included:

1. It was established through a protocol signed by 14 Albanian delegates and French Colonel Descoins[1][7].

2. Themistokli Gërmenji served as the first president and prefect of police[1][7].

3. The official language was Albanian, replacing Greek in schools and administration[1][2].

4. It had its own flag, currency, and postal stamps, functioning as a de facto independent state[1][4].

5. The province lasted until 1920, providing Albanians with an opportunity for self-governance under French tutelage[1][8].

The Autonomous Province of Korçë played a significant role in promoting Albanian nationalism and demonstrating successful cooperation between Albanian Christians and Muslims in governance[1][4]. It is considered an important experiment in Albanian self-administration during a crucial period of the country's history.
