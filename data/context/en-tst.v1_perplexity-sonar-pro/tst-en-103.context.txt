Yes, it is possible to have more than one Dharma name in Buddhism. Here are some key points about having multiple Dharma names:

1. Different traditions: A practitioner may receive Dharma names from different Buddhist traditions or teachers they study with over time[1][3].

2. Lay and monastic names: Some may have both a lay Dharma name received when taking refuge, and a separate monastic name if they later ordain as a monk or nun[1].

3. Generational names: In some traditions, disciples of the same teacher may share a common generational character in their Dharma names, in addition to their individual name[2].

4. Multiple ceremonies: A practitioner could receive different Dharma names at various ceremonies like taking refuge, receiving precepts, or ordination[3].

5. Personal choice: Some practitioners choose to use multiple Dharma names they've received, while others may primarily use one[4].

6. Symbolic meaning: Each Dharma name can have a unique symbolic meaning or aspiration for the practitioner's path[1][2].

7. Cultural factors: Practitioners studying Buddhism across different cultures may accumulate names in various languages[5].

8. No strict rules: There are no universal rules about Dharma names, so practices can vary between traditions and teachers[1][3].

While having multiple Dharma names is possible, it's important to remember that names are ultimately just conventional labels. The true essence of Buddhist practice lies beyond names and forms[4][5]. Practitioners are encouraged to focus on their spiritual development rather than becoming attached to particular names or titles.
