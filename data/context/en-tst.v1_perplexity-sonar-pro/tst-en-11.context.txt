Yes, there are several noteworthy Anglo-Irish mathematicians who made significant contributions to the field. Here are some of the most prominent ones:

Sir William Rowan Hamilton (1805-1865) is arguably the most famous Anglo-Irish mathematician. He made fundamental contributions to optics, dynamics, and algebra[3][8]. His work on quaternions and Hamiltonian mechanics proved significant for the development of quantum mechanics. Hamilton was born in Dublin and spent most of his career at Trinity College Dublin and the Royal Irish Academy[3].

Sir George Gabriel Stokes (1819-1903) was another highly influential Anglo-Irish mathematician and physicist[5][6]. He made important contributions to fluid dynamics, optics, and mathematical physics. Stokes is known for the Navier-Stokes equations and Stokes' theorem, although he did not discover the latter[5]. Born in Sligo, Ireland, Stokes had a distinguished career at Cambridge University and served as president of the Royal Society[6].

George Boole (1815-1864) was an English-born mathematician who spent much of his career in Ireland. He is famous for his work on the mathematization of logic and the invention of Boolean algebra, which became fundamental to computer science and digital electronics[5].

John Graves (1806-1870) was an Irish jurist and mathematician who inspired William Rowan Hamilton's discovery of quaternions and himself discovered octonions, which he called octaves[5].

George Salmon (1819-1904) was an Irish mathematician and Anglican theologian who made significant contributions to algebraic geometry[5]. He spent most of his career at Trinity College Dublin.

Henry John Stephen Smith (1826-1883) was an Irish mathematician remembered for his work in elementary divisors, quadratic forms, and the Smith-Minkowski-Siegel mass formula in number theory. He also devised the Smith normal form of a matrix[5].

William Brouncker (1620-1684), while born in Ireland, spent most of his career in England. He is best known for Brouncker's Formula, an expansion for pi in the form of a generalized continued fraction[4].

These mathematicians, among others, demonstrate the significant contributions of Anglo-Irish scholars to the field of mathematics, spanning various areas including algebra, geometry, logic, and mathematical physics.
