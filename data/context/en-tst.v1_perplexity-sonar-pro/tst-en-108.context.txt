Gregor Mendel was the first to experiment on pleiotropic traits, although he did not use that specific term at the time[1]. In his famous 1866 pea plant experiments, Mendel recognized that certain traits in pea plants, such as seed coat color, flower color, and axial spots, seemed to be inherited together[1]. This observation laid the groundwork for the concept of pleiotropy, where one gene influences multiple seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits.

However, it's important to note that while Mendel observed this phenomenon, he did not prove that these traits were controlled by a single gene, and the term "pleiotropy" had not yet been coined[1]. The actual term "pleiotropie" was first introduced by Ludwig Plate in 1910, about 44 years after Mendel's experiments[1].

Following Mendel's observations and Plate's coining of the term, Hans Gruneberg conducted the first systematic study of the mechanisms of pleiotropy in 1938[1]. Gruneberg's work involved experimenting on rats with skeletal mutations, which led him to propose two distinct types of pleiotropy: "genuine" and "spurious"[1]. Although his definitions have since been revised, Gruneberg's work marked a significant step forward in the scientific understanding of pleiotropic traits.
