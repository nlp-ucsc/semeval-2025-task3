The mistletoebird (Dicaeum hirundinaceum) is known to eat the fruit of Amyema quandang, commonly called the grey mistletoe[1][4]. 

The mistletoebird has a specialized diet that consists primarily of mistletoe berries, with Amyema quandang fruit being a significant part of its diet. This bird has several adaptations that make it particularly effective at consuming and dispersing mistletoe seeds:

1. Digestive system: The mistletoebird has a modified gastrointestinal tract that allows for rapid passage of mistletoe berries. It takes between 4-25 minutes for the mistletoe seed to pass through the bird's digestive system[4].

2. Feeding behavior: The mistletoebird consumes large quantities of mistletoe fruit, which accounts for about 85% of its foraging observations[4][8].

3. Seed dispersal: When defecating, the mistletoebird often perches facing along the host tree branch, depositing seeds in a string on the perch. This behavior increases the efficiency of mistletoe seed dispersal[4][5].

While the mistletoebird is the primary consumer of Amyema quandang fruit, it's worth noting that other birds also eat these berries:

- Spiny-cheeked honeyeater (Acanthagenys rufogularis) is known to consume the fruit, although it processes the seeds less efficiently than the mistletoebird[4].
- Over 40 species of Australian birds, especially honeyeaters, are known to eat mistletoe fruit in general[9].
- The Singing Honeyeater has been specifically mentioned as eating and distributing the berries of Amyema quandang[10].

The relationship between Amyema quandang and the mistletoebird is an example of mutualism in arid Australian ecosystems. The mistletoebird relies heavily on the mistletoe fruit for nutrition, while the mistletoe benefits from the bird's highly effective seed dispersal[2].
