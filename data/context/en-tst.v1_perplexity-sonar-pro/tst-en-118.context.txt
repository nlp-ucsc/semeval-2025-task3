The capital of Oudalan Province is Gorom-Gorom[1][2]. Gorom-Gorom is a town in northern Burkina Faso that serves as the administrative center for Oudalan Province[2]. The name "Gorom-Gorom" translates to "you sit down, (and) we'll sit down," which reflects its historical role as an important crossroads in the Sahel region[2].

Gorom-Gorom is known for its vibrant market and numerous mosques, attracting traders from various ethnic groups including Tuaregs, Bella, and Fula[2]. The town is located approximately 330 km northeast of Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso[3]. It also has a small airport situated about 2 km northeast of the town center[2].

Interestingly, Gorom-Gorom has been featured in literature, serving as the setting for the Sophie book series by British children's author Stephen Davies[2]. It has also been mentioned in travel literature, such as the book "Man kan ikke vaske én hånd" (One can't wash one hand) by Danish author Thyge Christensen, who documented his bicycle journey from Denmark to Gorom-Gorom[2].
