I apologize, but there appears to be some confusion in your question. Based on the search results provided, there is no single unified "West Athens" municipality composed of multiple municipalities. Instead, the search results refer to different locations that use the name "West Athens":

1. West Athens, California: This is a census-designated place (CDP) in Los Angeles County, California. It is not composed of multiple municipalities, but rather is an unincorporated community within Los Angeles County[2].

2. West Athens, Georgia: This refers to a general area in Athens, Georgia. It's not a formal municipality, but rather a part of the larger Athens area. It begins as you cross over the Middle Oconee River on W. Broad Street and extends to the Clarke county line[3].

3. West Athens as part of Athens, Greece: In this context, West Athens refers to one of the regional units that make up the Athens metropolitan area. It's not a separate municipality itself, but rather part of the larger Athens urban area[1][4].

None of these "West Athens" locations are composed of multiple municipalities. If you're looking for information about a specific West Athens area, it would be helpful to clarify which location you're interested in - California, Georgia, or Greece. Each of these areas has different characteristics and administrative structures.
