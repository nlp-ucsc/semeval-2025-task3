The walls of the orbit are derived from seven embryologically distinct bony structures[1][3][4]. Specifically:

1. Frontal bone
2. Sphenoid bone 
3. Maxillary bone
4. Zygomatic bone
5. Palatine bone 
6. Ethmoid bone
7. Lacrimal bone

These seven bones form a mosaic that makes up the orbital walls[4]. Each contributes to different parts of the orbit:

- The orbital roof is formed primarily by the frontal bone and the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone[1][4].

- The orbital floor comprises the maxillary, palatine, and zygomatic bones[1][4].

- The medial wall is formed by the lacrimal, ethmoid, maxillary, and lesser wing of the sphenoid bones[1][4].

- The lateral wall consists of the zygomatic bone anteriorly and the greater wing of the sphenoid bone posteriorly[1][4][9].

This complex arrangement of bones develops from neural crest cells during embryogenesis[2][3]. The orbital bones begin to ossify around the sixth gestational week, with most bones forming through intramembranous ossification. The exceptions are the sphenoid and ethmoid bones, which develop via endochondral ossification[8].

Understanding this embryological origin is crucial for comprehending orbital anatomy and various developmental anomalies that can affect the orbit[2][5].
