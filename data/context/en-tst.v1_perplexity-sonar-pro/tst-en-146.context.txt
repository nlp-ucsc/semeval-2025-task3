In the 2013 Iranian presidential election, there were initially 8 candidates approved to run by the Guardian Council[1]. Here are the key details:

1. Initial candidates: The Guardian Council screened 680 registered candidates and approved 8 to run in the election[1].

2. Final candidates: Two of the approved candidates withdrew before election day, leaving 6 candidates on the final ballot[1][4].

3. Approved candidates: The 8 initially approved candidates were:
   - Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf
   - Gholam-Ali Haddad-Adel
   - Ali Akbar Velayati
   - Saeed Jalili
   - Mohsen Rezaee
   - Mohammad Gharazi
   - Hassan Rouhani
   - Mohammad Reza Aref[1]

4. Withdrawals: Gholam-Ali Haddad-Adel and Mohammad Reza Aref withdrew from the race in the days leading up to the election[1].

5. Election outcome: Hassan Rouhani won the election in the first round with over 50% of the vote[1][4].

6. Voter turnout: The election saw a voter turnout of 72.94%, with 36,821,538 out of 50,483,192 eligible voters participating[4].

It's worth noting that the candidate selection process in Iran is quite restrictive. Out of 686 candidates who initially registered, only 8 (about 1.1%) were allowed to run after vetting by the Ministry of Interior and the Guardian Council[4].
