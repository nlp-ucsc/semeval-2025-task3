The Danish Golden Age is called "Den danske guldalder" in Danish[2][5]. This term refers to a period of remarkable cultural and artistic flourishing in Denmark, typically spanning from around 1800 to 1850, though some sources extend it to 1864[1][4].

"Den danske guldalder" encompasses a time of significant artistic, literary, and philosophical achievements in Danish history. It's important to note that while this period is referred to as a "Golden Age" in terms of cultural output, it paradoxically coincided with a time of political and economic challenges for Denmark[4][7].

The term "guldalder" (golden age) wasn't actually used by the artists and intellectuals of the time to describe their era. It was retrospectively applied to this period, first to literature around 1900, and later to visual arts in the 1940s[8]. This retrospective labeling highlights the nostalgic view later generations had of this culturally rich period in Danish history.

Interestingly, some of the artists of the time, like Constantin Hansen, didn't perceive their era as particularly "golden." Hansen, for instance, referred to it as a "Kobberalder" (Copper Age) due to his financial struggles while on a study trip in Italy[8].

Despite the challenges Denmark faced during this period, including wars, economic crises, and loss of territory, the cultural achievements of "Den danske guldalder" have become a source of national pride and continue to be celebrated in Danish art history.
