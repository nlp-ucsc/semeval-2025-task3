The light cruiser Emden was built at the Reichsmarinewerft shipyard in Wilhelmshaven, Germany[1]. Construction began on December 8, 1921 when her keel was laid down[1]. The ship was launched on January 7, 1925 and commissioned into service on October 15, 1925[1].

Some key details about Emden's construction:

- She was ordered on April 7, 1921[1]
- Her yard number was 100 and she was built on slip/drydock number I at the shipyard[1]
- She was the only ship of the Emden-class of light cruisers[1]
- Her construction was delayed significantly due to Germany's economic hardship after World War I and British objections[1]
- She was one of the most advanced cruisers at the time, being the first ship of her size to use electrical welding in construction[1]

It's worth noting that this Emden was actually the third German naval vessel to bear this name. The original SMS Emden was a Dresden-class light cruiser built in the early 1900s at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Dockyard) in Danzig[2]. This first Emden became famous for her commerce raiding activities at the start of World War I before being sunk in 1914[5]. The Emden built in the 1920s was named in honor of this earlier ship and to carry on its legacy[4].
