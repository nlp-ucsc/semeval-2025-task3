Cyrtophora moluccensis, commonly known as the tent spider or dome-web spider, is native to a wide range of countries across the Asia-Pacific region. Based on the search results, its native distribution includes:

1. India
2. Japan
3. Indonesia (including the Moluccas, from which it gets its species name)
4. Papua New Guinea
5. Australia
6. Solomon Islands
7. Palau
8. Micronesia
9. Fiji
10. Tonga
11. French Polynesia

The spider's distribution extends from India in the west to various Pacific islands in the east[1]. It's important to note that this species has a broad native range rather than originating from a single country. The name "moluccensis" suggests a connection to the Moluccas (Maluku Islands) in Indonesia, but the spider's natural habitat is much more extensive.

Cyrtophora moluccensis is well-adapted to tropical and subtropical environments, which explains its widespread presence across Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands. It can be found in various habitats within these regions, including open woodlands, parks, and gardens[10].
