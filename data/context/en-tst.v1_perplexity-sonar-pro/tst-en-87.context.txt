HSC Csíkszereda was founded in 1929[1]. The club's origins can be traced back to that year when some young men in Miercurea Ciuc (Csíkszereda in Hungarian) saw a film about an ice hockey match and were inspired to form their own team[1].

While ice skating had been popular in the region since the 1870s, with the first skating association (Csíkszeredai Korcsolyázó Egylet) established in 1881, the specific ice hockey team that would become HSC Csíkszereda wasn't formed until 1929[1][8].

The club's early history includes some notable events:

1. In January 1931, they played their first matches against Tenis Club Român from Bucharest[1].
2. The team entered the Romanian championship in 1933[1].
3. After the Second Vienna Award in 1940, when the city was temporarily reassigned to Hungary, the team entered the Hungarian league[1].

HSC Csíkszereda has since become one of the most successful ice hockey teams in Romania, winning numerous national championships and cups, as well as competing in international leagues like the Erste Liga[1][3].
