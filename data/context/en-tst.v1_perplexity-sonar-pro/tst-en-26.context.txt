Bahram I reigned as king of Persia from 273 to 276 CE[1][2][3]. He was the fourth Sasanian king and succeeded his brother Hormizd I[3]. 

Some key details about Bahram I's reign:

- He came to power with the support of the influential Zoroastrian priest Kartir[3][4].

- His reign lasted approximately 3 years, from 273 to 276 CE[1][2]. 

- He was the son of Shapur I and had previously served as governor of the province of Atropatene during his father's reign[2].

- His succession strengthened the position of the Zoroastrian clergy[2].

While most sources agree on the 273-276 CE timeframe, it's worth noting there is some minor variation in the exact dates given by different historians. For example, one source lists his reign as June 271 to September 274[3]. However, the consensus places his rule in the 273-276 CE period.
