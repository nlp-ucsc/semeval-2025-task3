The hole-in-the-head frog belongs to the genus Huia[1]. Specifically, it is the only member of this genus, with the scientific name Huia cavitympanum[1][2].

Some key points about the hole-in-the-head frog (Huia cavitympanum):

1. Taxonomy: It is a species of frog in the family Ranidae[1]. The genus Huia is now considered monotypic, containing only this single species[2][4].

2. Distribution: It is found only on the island of Borneo[1][5].

3. Habitat: Its natural habitats include subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, moist montane forests, and torrential rivers[1][5]. It prefers primary forest in hilly areas, typically at elevations between 250-750 meters above sea level[4].

4. Unique characteristics:
   - It is the only known frog species to vocalize purely at ultrasonic frequencies[1][4].
   - It has eardrums recessed in the side of the skull, with an ear canal similar to mammalian anatomy[1].
   - The species gets its common name from this distinctive ear structure.

5. Conservation: The species is threatened by habitat loss[1][5].

6. Breeding behavior: It breeds in stretches of streams with foaming rapids and large boulders. The tadpoles have adapted to cling to rocks in fast-moving currents using an abdominal sucker[4].

This frog species is particularly notable for its unique anatomical features and its ability to produce and detect ultrasonic calls, which is rare among amphibians.
