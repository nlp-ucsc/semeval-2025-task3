The Pasteur lunar crater was named after Louis Pasteur, the renowned French chemist and microbiologist[1]. Louis Pasteur was born on December 27, 1822, in Dole, France, and died on September 28, 1895, in Saint-Cloud[2][5].

Louis Pasteur made significant contributions to science, including:

1. Discovering the role of microbes in fermentation and disease[2][5].
2. Inventing the process of pasteurization, which is used to destroy harmful microbes in food and beverages[2][8].
3. Developing vaccines for diseases such as anthrax and rabies[2][5].
4. Pioneering the study of molecular asymmetry[5].
5. Saving the beer, wine, and silk industries in France through his scientific work[5].

Pasteur is considered one of the most important founders of medical microbiology and has been credited with saving millions of lives through his discoveries and developments in vaccination[10]. His work laid the foundations for modern hygiene, public health, and much of modern medicine[10].

The Pasteur crater on the Moon is a large lunar impact crater, approximately 233 kilometers in diameter[1]. It is located on the far side of the Moon, just beyond the eastern limb as seen from Earth[1][4]. The crater belongs to the category termed a "walled plain" due to its size and characteristics[1].
