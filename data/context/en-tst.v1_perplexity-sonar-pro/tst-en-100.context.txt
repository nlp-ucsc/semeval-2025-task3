Liu Wenhui studied at the Baoding Military Academy, graduating in 1916[1][4]. 

The Baoding Military Academy was an important institution for training military officers in China during the early 20th century. Located in Baoding, Hebei province, it produced many influential military and political leaders who played significant roles in modern Chinese history.

After graduating from the Baoding Military Academy in 1916, Liu Wenhui returned to his home province of Sichuan, where he began his military career[4]. This education at Baoding provided Liu with the military training and connections that helped launch his career as a warlord and military leader in Sichuan province over the following decades.

Liu's time at the Baoding Military Academy likely exposed him to modern military tactics and technologies, as well as nationalist ideologies that were influential among many of the academy's students and graduates during that era. This educational background shaped Liu's subsequent military and political career as he rose to become one of the major warlords controlling Sichuan province in the 1920s and 1930s.
