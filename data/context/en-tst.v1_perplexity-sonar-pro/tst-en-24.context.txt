Ritscher Upland was named after Captain Alfred Ritscher, a German polar explorer and leader of the Third German Antarctic Expedition in 1938-39[1][6].

Alfred Ritscher was born on May 23, 1879 in Bad Lauterberg, Prussia and died on March 30, 1963 in Hamburg, Germany[1]. He had a distinguished career as both a seaman and an airman, eventually becoming a Kapit√§n zur See (Captain at Sea) in the Kriegsmarine, the navy of Nazi Germany[1][2].

In 1938-39, Ritscher led the Third German Antarctic Expedition, which was tasked with mapping and claiming territory in Antarctica. This expedition explored and mapped parts of Queen Maud Land, which the Germans named Neuschwabenland (New Swabia)[1][2]. During this expedition, Ritscher and his team:

1. Used two Dornier Do J II flying boats to conduct aerial surveys
2. Photographed and mapped an area of about 600,000 square kilometers (230,000 sq mi)
3. Took approximately 11,000 aerial photographs of the region[1]

The area now known as Ritscher Upland was discovered during this expedition. In recognition of Ritscher's leadership and contributions to Antarctic exploration, this geographical feature was named after him[6]. 

Additionally, Ritscher Peak in the Wohlthat Mountains of Queen Maud Land is also named in his honor[1][4]. These namings serve as lasting tributes to Ritscher's significant role in early Antarctic exploration and mapping.
