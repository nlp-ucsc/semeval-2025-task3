The first settlers of Steelville, Missouri were William Britton and James Steel, who arrived in the area in the 1830s[1][2][4].

William Britton came to the site in 1833 and built a small log house and grist mill along Yadkin Creek[1][3]. His grist mill served people from up to 15 miles away for about 10 years before he moved westward and built a larger mill on the Meramec River[3].

James Steel arrived around 1835 and established a trading post[1][2]. He purchased 40 acres of land from the government, which he later sold to the Crawford County Court on December 16, 1835, for $50[1][2][4]. This transaction led to the founding and naming of Steelville.

The town was officially laid out in 1835-1836, with James Steel appointed by the government as the commissioner to plan the city[1][2][4]. The Crawford County Court named the town Steelville in honor of James Steel, and the deed was recorded on December 18, 1835[1][2]. Shortly after, the town was platted and the first lots were sold for $12 each[1][2].

It's worth noting that while Britton and Steel were the first settlers of what became Steelville, the area had been previously inhabited by Native American groups, likely tied to the Osage nation, before they were forced westward[2][4].
