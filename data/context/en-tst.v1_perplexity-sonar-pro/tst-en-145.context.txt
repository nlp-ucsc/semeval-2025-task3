Health, the American noise rock band, has indeed composed music for video games. Their most notable contribution to video game soundtracks is for the Max Payne 3 game.

Health composed and performed the original score for Max Payne 3, which was released in 2012. The game was developed by Rockstar Games, known for series like Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption. Health's soundtrack for Max Payne 3 was critically acclaimed and helped enhance the gritty, intense atmosphere of the game.

The band's industrial and electronic sound paired well with the game's neo-noir aesthetic and action-packed gameplay. Some of the notable tracks from the soundtrack include "TEARS" and "PILLS," which became popular even outside the context of the game.

This collaboration marked Health's first foray into video game soundtracks, and it demonstrated how well their unique sound could complement interactive media. The Max Payne 3 soundtrack was later released as a standalone album, allowing fans to enjoy the music separately from the game.

While Max Payne 3 remains Health's most significant contribution to video game music, their work on this project showcased the potential for non-traditional artists to create compelling game soundtracks.
