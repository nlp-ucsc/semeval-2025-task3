The brown-headed crow (Corvus fuscicapillus) belongs to the family Corvidae[1][3]. 

Corvidae is the family that includes crows, ravens, rooks, jackdaws, jays, magpies, treepies, choughs, and nutcrackers. Some key points about the brown-headed crow and its family classification:

1. It is a passerine bird, meaning it belongs to the order Passeriformes[1][3].

2. Within Passeriformes, it is classified in the family Corvidae, which contains the crow genus Corvus[1][3].

3. Its full scientific name is Corvus fuscicapillus, with Corvus being the genus name for crows[1][3].

4. The Corvidae family is known for containing some of the most intelligent bird species[1].

5. Other notable members of the Corvidae family include ravens, jays, and magpies[1].

The brown-headed crow is endemic to Indonesia and has a fragmented distribution in subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and mangrove forests[1][3]. It is considered near-threatened due to habitat loss[1][3]. Unlike some other birds discussed in the search results, such as the brown-headed cowbird (which belongs to the family Icteridae), the brown-headed crow is firmly classified within the crow family Corvidae[1][3].
