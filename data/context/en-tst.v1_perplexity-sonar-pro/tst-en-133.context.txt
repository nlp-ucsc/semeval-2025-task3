Based on the search results provided, there is no specific mention of Martello towers on the island of Formentera. The search results primarily discuss other aspects of Formentera's geography, history, and attractions. 

However, the search results do mention other types of defensive structures on Formentera:

1. Watchtowers: Formentera has a system of watchtowers spread out along the coast, built in the 18th century to protect against pirate incursions. There are four towers on Formentera itself, plus one on the nearby islet of s'Espalmador[6]. These include:

   - Punta Prima tower
   - Pi Catal√° or Migjorn tower
   - Des Garroveret or Des Cap tower
   - Sa Gavina tower
   - Sa Guardiola tower (on s'Espalmador)

2. Roman fort: There is mention of an unfinished Roman fort called Can Blai on Formentera[10], but this is not a Martello tower.

It's important to note that Martello towers are specifically a type of small defensive fort built across the British Empire during the 19th century[3]. Since Formentera is part of Spain and has not been under British control, it's unlikely to have Martello towers in the strict sense.

If you're interested in defensive structures on Formentera, the island's system of 18th-century watchtowers would be the most relevant to explore.
