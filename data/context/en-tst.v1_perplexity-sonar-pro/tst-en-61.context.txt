Maroilles cheese is produced in the northern regions of France, specifically:

1. Hauts-de-France (formerly known as Nord-Pas-de-Calais)[1][3][5]
2. Picardy[8][9]

The production area is more precisely defined as:

1. The Avesnois region, which surrounds the city of Avesnes[1]
2. The French départements of Nord and Aisne[1]
3. The historical Thiérache area, known for its meadows[3]

Maroilles received its Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) status in 1955[1], which was later upgraded to Appellation d'Origine Protégée (AOP) in 1996[2]. This designation ensures that the cheese is produced within its traditional region using specific methods.

The cheese takes its name from the village of Maroilles, where it was originally created by monks in the Abbey of Maroilles during the 7th century[1][2]. While it began in this specific location, its production has since expanded to cover a broader area within these northern French regions.
