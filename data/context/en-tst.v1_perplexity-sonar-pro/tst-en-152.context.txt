Edward Drinker Cope named the family Nimravidae in 1880[5]. The Nimravidae are an extinct family of carnivorans known as "false saber-toothed cats" whose fossils have been found in North America and Eurasia[5]. 

Nimravids were not true cats (family Felidae), but are generally considered closely related and classified as a distinct family within the suborder Feliformia[5]. They lived from the Middle Eocene through the Late Miocene epochs, spanning about 33.2 million years from 40.4 to 7.2 million years ago[5].

Some key facts about the Nimravidae family named by Cope:

- They evolved diverse dentition, with some developing large, flattened upper canines similar to saber-toothed cats, while others had more moderate canines[5].

- Their upper canines were generally shorter and more conical than those of true saber-toothed cats[5].

- Nimravids showed diversity in size and morphology comparable to modern cats, ranging from leopard-sized to lion-sized species[5].

- Notable genera within Nimravidae include Dinictis and Hoplophoneus, which are found in fossils from the White River Formation[8].

- Unlike some other carnivoran groups, nimravids successfully spread from North America to Eurasia during their evolutionary history[5].

Edward Drinker Cope made significant contributions to paleontology, including naming this family of fascinating prehistoric carnivores that convergently evolved saber-tooth-like features separate from the true saber-toothed cats.
