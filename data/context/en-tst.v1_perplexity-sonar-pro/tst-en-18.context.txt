Magnar Solberg won gold medals in the 20 km individual biathlon event at two Winter Olympics[1][2][4]. Specifically:

1. He won his first gold medal in the 20 km individual biathlon at the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France[1][2][4].

2. Solberg successfully defended his title by winning gold again in the 20 km individual biathlon at the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Japan[1][2][4].

Solberg's achievements were particularly notable for several reasons:

- He was the first biathlete to defend an Olympic gold medal in an individual event[1].
- He remains the only biathlete to win the 20 km event twice, which was the original Olympic biathlon event[1].
- In his 1968 victory, Solberg achieved a perfect shooting score, something he had never done before in competition[2][7].
- At the time of his 1972 victory, Solberg set the record as the oldest gold medalist in an individual event at the Winter Olympics, being 35 years and 4 days old[2].

In addition to his individual gold medals, Solberg also won a silver medal as part of the Norwegian 4 Ã— 7.5 km relay team in the 1968 Winter Olympics[1][2][4].
