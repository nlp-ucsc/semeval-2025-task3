Aukštojas Hill, the highest point in Lithuania, has an elevation of 293.84 meters (964.0 feet) above sea level[1][2][4]. This measurement was taken in 2004 by specialists from the Institute of Geodesy at Vilnius Gediminas Technical University using GPS technology[1][2].

Prior to this measurement, Juozapinė Hill, with an elevation of 292.7 meters (960 feet), was considered the highest point in Lithuania[1][2]. The discovery of Aukštojas Hill as the true highest point came after suspicions were raised in 1985 by Lithuanian geographer Rimantas Krupickas that Juozapinė Hill might not actually be the country's highest elevation[1][3].

Interestingly, Aukštojas Hill is located approximately 500 meters (1,600 feet) west of Juozapinė Hill[1][2]. Both hills are situated in the Medininkai Highlands, about 24 kilometers (15 miles) southeast of Lithuania's capital city, Vilnius[1][2].

The summit of Aukštojas Hill features a grove of pine trees, which is characteristic of the Medininkai region[2]. The hill's name, "Aukštojas," was suggested by Libertas Klimka, a history professor at Vilnius Pedagogical University, and was officially approved on November 18, 2005[2].
