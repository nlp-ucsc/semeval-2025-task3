Theano belonged to the Pythagorean school of philosophy[1][2]. She was a prominent member of this philosophical and mathematical tradition founded by Pythagoras in the 6th century BC in Croton, southern Italy.

Some key points about Theano's involvement with the Pythagorean school:

1. Student and teacher: Theano was initially a student of Pythagoras, later becoming one of the school's teachers and leaders[1][2].

2. Marriage to Pythagoras: Most sources indicate that Theano married Pythagoras, despite being much younger than him[2][4].

3. Equal rights: The Pythagorean school was notable for accepting both men and women as students and teachers on an equal basis, which was unusual for that time[1].

4. Leadership role: After Pythagoras's death, Theano reportedly took charge of running the Pythagorean school, along with her daughters[1][2].

5. Contributions: Theano is credited with writing treatises on various subjects including mathematics, physics, medicine, and child psychology[1][4].

6. Longevity of the school: Under Theano's leadership, the Pythagorean school continued to operate and spread its philosophy throughout the Mediterranean for nearly 200 years after Pythagoras's death[2].

7. Secrecy: Like all members of the Pythagorean school, Theano was sworn to secrecy about the school's teachings, which makes it challenging to attribute specific works to her with certainty[3].

The Pythagorean school was known for its focus on mathematics, philosophy, and a quasi-religious approach to understanding the universe. Theano's involvement in this school makes her one of the earliest known female philosophers and mathematicians in Western history[4][5].
