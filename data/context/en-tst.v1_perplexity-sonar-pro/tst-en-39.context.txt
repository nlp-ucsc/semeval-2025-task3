John Christopher Willis was not a proponent of natural selection as the primary mechanism of evolution. In fact, he was a notable critic of Darwinian natural selection theory[1][3][4].

Key points about Willis' views on evolution:

1. Criticism of natural selection: Willis rejected the idea that natural selection was the main driver of species origin and evolution[1][3][4]. He argued that the evidence from plant distribution and speciation did not support the Darwinian model.

2. Age and Area hypothesis: Willis developed the "Age and Area" hypothesis, which proposed that the geographical range of a species was primarily determined by its age, rather than its adaptiveness[4]. This contradicted Darwinian expectations.

3. Saltational evolution: Willis favored a saltational model of evolution, where new species arise through major mutations or "jumps" rather than gradual changes[4][9]. He believed that new genera could arise suddenly through large mutations.

4. Role of mutations: While Willis accepted that mutations occurred, he saw them as the primary mechanism for evolutionary change, rather than natural selection acting on small variations[7].

5. Differentiation theory: In his book "The Course of Evolution by Differentiation or Divergent Mutation Rather Than by Selection" (1940), Willis proposed an alternative to natural selection[1][4]. He argued for a process of "differentiation" where major mutations create new lineages.

6. Purposeful evolution: Willis suggested that evolution seemed to follow an ordered, purposeful pattern rather than being driven by random chance as in Darwinian theory[3].

7. Electrical influence: Intriguingly, Willis speculated that some kind of electrical force or law might be behind the ordered pattern of evolution he perceived[3].

While Willis did not deny that natural selection occurred, he relegated it to a minor role in evolution, mainly acting to eliminate unfit mutations early in their existence[1]. His views represented a significant challenge to orthodox Darwinism in the early-to-mid 20th century, based on his extensive botanical research rather than religious motivations[3][6].
