Two bronze medals were awarded for the Women's +67 kg Taekwondo event at the 2012 Summer Olympics[3][9]. The bronze medal winners were:

1. Anastasia Baryshnikova from Russia
2. Maria del Rosario Espinoza from Mexico

In Olympic taekwondo competitions, it's standard practice to award two bronze medals. This is done through a repechage system, where athletes who lose to the eventual finalists get a chance to compete for bronze[3]. This format ensures that two athletes can earn bronze medals, providing more opportunities for Olympic recognition in the sport.
