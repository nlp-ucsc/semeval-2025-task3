Feng Kai represented China (officially the People's Republic of China) at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City[1][3]. He competed in short track speed skating events for the Chinese team[1][3].

Specifically, Feng Kai participated in the following events at the 2002 Winter Olympics:

1. 500 metres men's event, where he finished in 4th place[1].
2. 1,000 metres men's event, where he finished in 10th place[1].
3. 5,000 metres relay men's event, where he was part of the Chinese team that won the bronze medal[1][3].

This bronze medal in the 5,000 metres relay was Feng Kai's second Olympic bronze medal, as he had previously won a bronze medal in the same event at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan[1][3].

Feng Kai was born on August 29, 1978, in Changchun, Jilin, China[1][3]. He was 23 years old when he competed in the 2002 Winter Olympics. His participation in both the 1998 and 2002 Winter Olympics demonstrates his consistency as a top-level short track speed skater for China during that period.
