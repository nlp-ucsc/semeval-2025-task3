The nudist beach on Agistri island is called Chalikiada Beach (also spelled Halikiada or Chalkiada)[1][2][3][4][5]. 

Chalikiada Beach is located on the southeastern side of Agistri island and is known for being the main nudist-friendly beach on the island[1][2]. It's a secluded cove surrounded by pine forests, featuring white pebbles and emerald green waters[3]. The beach is accessible by foot from the village of Skala, requiring about a 10-minute walk through a forest path[2][7].

Some key features of Chalikiada Beach include:

1. It's a natural, undeveloped beach with no facilities or amenities[1][5].
2. The beach is approximately 100 meters long[5].
3. It's situated beneath a steep orange-colored cliff, requiring some careful climbing to access[5].
4. The area is popular for free camping and has a counterculture presence, often lined with small tents[5][7].
5. While primarily known as a nudist beach, it's not exclusively so - visitors can choose to wear swimwear if they prefer[10].

Chalikiada Beach offers a more rustic and natural beach experience compared to the more developed beaches on Agistri. It's worth noting that due to its secluded nature and lack of facilities, visitors should come prepared with their own supplies, including water, food, and sun protection[1][2].
