Erik Gunnar Asplund worked as a professor of architecture at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden[1][3][6]. He was appointed to this position in 1931[1][3][7]. His appointment was marked by a notable lecture titled "Our architectonic concept of space," which was later published and considered an important contribution to architectural discourse of the time[1].

Asplund's role at the Royal Institute of Technology was significant, as he was already a well-established and influential architect by the time of his appointment. He was known for his key contributions to Nordic Classicism in the 1920s and later became a major proponent of the modernist style in Sweden[1][3]. His teaching position allowed him to influence future generations of Swedish and Nordic architects, solidifying his impact on Scandinavian architecture[1].

It's worth noting that Asplund had a connection to this institution even before becoming a professor there. He had studied architecture at the Royal Institute of Technology earlier in his career[4][5], which adds an interesting dimension to his later role as an educator at the same institution.
