Liu Wenhui was educated at the Baoding Military Academy, graduating in 1916[1][4]. The Baoding Military Academy, also known as the Paoting Military Academy, was a prestigious military institution located in Baoding, China[4]. It was one of the most important military academies in China during the late Qing dynasty and early Republic of China period, operating in the first two decades of the 20th century[4].

The Baoding Military Academy played a significant role in shaping China's military leadership during that era. It was considered one of the "three major strategist cradles in modern China," alongside the Yunnan Military Academy and the Whampoa Military Academy[4]. Many of its graduates went on to hold prominent positions in the Chinese military and political spheres.

Liu Wenhui's education at this institution would have provided him with a strong military background, which likely contributed to his subsequent career as a military leader and warlord in Sichuan province. The academy's curriculum typically included various military, mathematical, and scientific subjects, as well as foreign languages and Chinese classics[4]. This comprehensive education would have prepared Liu for his future roles in the complex political and military landscape of early 20th century China.
