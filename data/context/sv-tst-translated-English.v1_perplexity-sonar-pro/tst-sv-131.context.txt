Ożarów was founded in 1569 by Józef Ożarowski as a private town[1]. This founding date is corroborated by multiple sources:

1. The ESJF survey of the Ożarów Jewish Cemetery states that "Ożarów was founded in 1569 by Józef Ożarowski as a private town"[1].

2. The Mapy.cz entry for Ożarów also lists 1569 as the date the town was founded[7].

3. The town's name itself provides evidence of its founder, as it derives from "Ożarowski +‎ -ów", referring to Józef Ożarowski, a 16th century nobleman who established the city[9].

Józef Ożarowski belonged to the Polish nobility, specifically using the Rawicz coat of arms[9]. The establishment of Ożarów as a private town was a common practice in Poland during this period, where nobles would found and own towns on their estates.

It's worth noting that while 1569 marks the official founding of Ożarów as a town, there may have been earlier settlements in the area. However, this date represents the formal establishment of Ożarów as a recognized urban center under the ownership and patronage of Józef Ożarowski.
