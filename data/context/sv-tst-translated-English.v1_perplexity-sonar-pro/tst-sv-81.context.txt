The term "Danish Golden Age" (Den danske guldalder) was first used to describe the exceptional creative period in Denmark during the first half of the 19th century in 1890 by the Danish philosopher Valdemar Vedel[1]. 

Specifically:

- In 1890, Valdemar Vedel first used the term "Guldalderen" (Golden Age) to describe this period of Danish cultural flourishing.

- In 1896, author Vilhelm Andersen further cemented the use of this term, referring to the period initiated by Henrich Steffens as the richest in Danish cultural history[1].

It's important to note that the artists, writers, and thinkers of the time did not refer to themselves as part of a "Golden Age" while they were living through it. The term was applied retrospectively, nearly half a century after the period is generally considered to have ended around 1850[1][3].

The Danish Golden Age is typically dated from around 1800 to 1850, though some scholars extend it to 1864[3]. It encompassed a remarkable flowering of arts and culture in Denmark, particularly in painting, literature, philosophy, and science, despite the country facing significant political and economic challenges during this time[1][3].
