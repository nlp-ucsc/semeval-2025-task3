According to the population data provided, Dourbies had 186 inhabitants in 2008[1][10]. This figure represents the "population municipale" (municipal population), which is the main population count for the commune. 

Additionally, the data shows:
- A "population comptée à part" (population counted separately) of 8 people
- A total population ("population totale") of 194 in 2008

It's worth noting that the population of Dourbies has been declining over the years:
- In 2013, the municipal population decreased to 163
- By 2018, it further reduced to 140 inhabitants[10]

This trend indicates a gradual depopulation of the commune over the decade from 2008 to 2018.
