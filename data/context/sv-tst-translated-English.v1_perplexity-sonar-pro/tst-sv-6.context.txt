The African sea bass, also known as Cephalopholis taeniops, belongs to the family Serranidae[6]. This family includes sea basses, groupers, and anthias[2][6].

Serranidae is a diverse family of marine ray-finned fishes[2]. Some key characteristics of this family include:

1. Taxonomic classification:
   - Kingdom: Animalia
   - Phylum: Chordata
   - Class: Actinopterygii
   - Order: Perciformes
   - Family: Serranidae[2][3]

2. Diversity: The Serranidae family contains approximately 70 genera and 577 species, although some authorities list a lower number of around 450 species and 65 genera[3].

3. Subfamilies: Cephalopholis taeniops specifically belongs to the subfamily Epinephelinae within the Serranidae family[6].

4. Common names: Fish in this family are often referred to as sea basses, groupers, or hinds[2][6].

5. Characteristics: Serranids typically lack teeth on the roof of their mouths (vomer) and have a continuous dorsal fin, distinguishing them from other similar families like snappers and temperate basses[10].

6. Hermaphroditism: Many species in the Serranidae family, including groupers, exhibit sequential hermaphroditism, often starting as females and later becoming males[10].

It's worth noting that while the African sea bass belongs to the Serranidae family, not all fish commonly called "sea bass" belong to this family. For example, the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) belongs to the family Moronidae[8], and the barramundi (Lates calcarifer) belongs to the family Centropomidae[1][9].
