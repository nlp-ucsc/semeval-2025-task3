The Veryovkina Cave, located in Abkhazia (a disputed region of Georgia), is currently recognized as the second deepest known cave on Earth, with a confirmed depth of 2,209 meters (7,247 feet)[1][6]. This measurement includes a 26-meter (85-foot) deep lower siphon at the bottom of the cave[1].

Some key points about the cave's depth:

1. Historical measurements:
   - In August 2017, the cave was explored to a depth of 2,204 meters (7,231 feet)[1].
   - In March 2018, the depth was recorded as 2,212 meters (7,257 feet) after measuring the terminal siphon lake[1][2].

2. Recent update:
   - As of August 2024, the officially recognized depth was adjusted to 2,209 meters (7,247 feet) following precise measurements using high-precision GNSS receivers[1].

3. Comparison:
   - It is slightly shallower than the Krubera-Voronja Cave, which is currently listed as the deepest at 2,224 meters (7,297 feet)[6].

4. Cave system:
   - The cave features extensive horizontal tunnels, with over 6,000 meters (20,000 feet) of subhorizontal passages below the 2,100-meter (6,900-foot) depth[1].
   - The total length of the cave system is reported to be about 17,500 meters (57,400 feet)[3].

5. Entrance location:
   - The cave entrance is situated at an elevation of 2,285 meters (7,497 feet) above sea level[1].

It's worth noting that cave depths can be subject to change as new explorations and more precise measurements are conducted. The Veryovkina Cave remains an active site of speleological research and exploration.
