The distance between Yushu and Xining, the provincial capital of Qinghai, varies depending on the source and measurement method:

1. By road, the distance is approximately 795 kilometers, which takes about 11 hours to drive[2].

2. The direct air distance is around 646 kilometers[5].

3. Some sources report slightly different figures:
   - 528 miles (849 kilometers) by road, with an estimated driving time of about 9 hours 57 minutes[3].
   - 2,433 kilometers, though this seems to be an outlier and likely incorrect[1].

4. Bus travel between the two cities typically takes 12-20 hours, depending on the type of bus (seated or sleeper) and road conditions[4].

5. There are also flights available between Yushu Batang Airport (YUS) and Xining, which is a much faster option[5].

The significant travel time despite the relatively shorter distance is due to the challenging terrain of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where both cities are located. The roads often wind through mountainous areas, contributing to longer travel times[2][4].

It's worth noting that Yushu is situated in a remote part of Qinghai province, which contributes to its relative isolation and the long travel times to reach it from the provincial capital[10].
