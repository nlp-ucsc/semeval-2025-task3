La Balme is a commune located in the Arrondissement of Chambéry, in the Savoie department of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in southeastern France[1][8][9]. 

It's important to note that there are two distinct communes with similar names:

1. La Balme in Savoie department[1]
2. Labalme in Ain department[2]

The query specifically asks about Labalme, which is the commune in the Ain department. However, the search results primarily provide information about La Balme in Savoie. For Labalme in Ain, the search results do not explicitly state which arrondissement it belongs to.

To provide a complete answer, we would need additional information about the administrative division of Labalme in the Ain department. Without this specific information, I cannot definitively state which arrondissement Labalme (Ain) is located in.

If you meant to ask about La Balme in Savoie, then the answer is clear: it is located in the Arrondissement of Chambéry[8][9].
