Flowers in the genus Parnassia, which includes the species commonly known as "grass-of-Parnassus" or "Paternoster flower", typically have 5 fertile stamens[6][9]. However, the flower structure of Parnassia is quite unique and interesting:

1. Fertile stamens: There are 5 fertile stamens that are more than half as long as the petals and spread out between them[6].

2. Sterile stamens (staminodes): In addition to the fertile stamens, Parnassia flowers have sets of sterile stamens called staminodes[6][9]. These are located between the fertile stamens, at the base of each petal.

3. Structure of staminodes: Each set of staminodes consists of 3 white sterile stamens that are about 1/3 to 1/2 the length of the fertile stamens[6]. These sterile stamens are tipped with yellowish glands.

4. Number of staminodes: The total number of sterile stamens (staminodes) is typically much higher than the fertile stamens. In Parnassia glauca (American Grass-of-Parnassus), there are usually 5 or more clusters of staminodes, with an average of 12 to 14 in total[6].

5. Appearance: The arrangement of fertile stamens and staminodes gives the flower a complex and distinctive appearance. The staminodes can sometimes appear as if there are many more stamens than actually present[9].

It's worth noting that while the common name "Paternoster flower" is associated with this genus due to its use in religious contexts, the scientific name Parnassia is not directly related to the Paternoster prayer. The unique stamen arrangement in Parnassia flowers is a fascinating example of floral diversity and adaptation in the plant kingdom.
