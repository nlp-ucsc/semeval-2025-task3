The search results do not provide specific information about the number of municipalities that are part of a municipal association in Göllheim. The information given about Göllheim is limited and does not mention any municipal association.

Göllheim is described as a municipality in the Donnersbergkreis, in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany[1]. It is mentioned as the seat of a Verbandsgemeinde ("collective municipality") called Göllheim[1]. However, the search results do not specify how many municipalities are part of this Verbandsgemeinde or any other municipal association in Göllheim.

Without more specific information about Göllheim's municipal structure or associations, I cannot provide an accurate count of municipalities in any Göllheim-based municipal association. To get this information, we would need to consult sources that specifically detail the administrative structure of Göllheim or the composition of its Verbandsgemeinde.
