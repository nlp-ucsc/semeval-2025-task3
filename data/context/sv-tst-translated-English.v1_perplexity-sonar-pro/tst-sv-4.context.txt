Tilia dasystyla, also known as the Crimean linden, is indeed a species of linden or lime tree[1][5]. It is a deciduous tree native to the Crimean Peninsula and surrounding regions, belonging to the Malvaceae family and the Tilia genus[1][5].

Key characteristics of Tilia dasystyla include:

1. Appearance: It is a potentially large tree, capable of reaching heights up to 35 meters (115 feet)[5]. The tree has broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer[1].

2. Bark and branches: The bark is grey and develops ridges as the tree matures, which may crack into square scales. The branchlets are slender, often red, especially when exposed to sunlight[5].

3. Leaves: The leaf blades are 5-13 cm long and 5-11 cm wide, broadly ovate or orbicular in shape, with acuminate tips and cordate or obliquely truncate bases. The upper surface is green, while the lower surface is somewhat greyish-green with clusters of light brown hair in the vein axils[5].

4. Flowers and fruit: The tree produces drooping inflorescences with 3-7 flowers. The fruits are 7-11 mm long and 5-8 mm wide, spherical to obovoid in shape, and covered with a dense white tomentum[5].

5. Growing conditions: Tilia dasystyla thrives in temperate climates with moderate temperatures. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining loamy soil that is rich in organic matter. The tree benefits from regular watering to keep the soil evenly moist and moderate humidity levels[1].

Tilia dasystyla is sometimes confused with or considered closely related to Tilia x euchlora, which is thought to be a hybrid between Tilia cordata and Tilia dasystyla[4]. Both trees are known as Crimean linden and share similar characteristics, which can make identification challenging.

In landscaping, Tilia dasystyla is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its attractive foliage and fragrant flowers. It is often used in parks and large gardens due to its potential to grow to significant heights[1]. The tree also attracts bees and butterflies, making it an excellent addition to pollinator gardens[3].
