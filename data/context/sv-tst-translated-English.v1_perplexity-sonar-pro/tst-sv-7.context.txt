Steelville was named after James Steel, who played a key role in the town's founding and early development[1][8]. Here are the key details about how Steelville got its name:

1. James Steel was one of the first settlers in the area, along with William Britton[1].

2. Steel operated a trading post in the early settlement[1][8].

3. In 1835, James Steel was appointed by the government as Commissioner to lay out the city[1].

4. That same year, Steel purchased 40 acres of land from the government, which he later sold to the County Court on December 16, 1835, for $50[1].

5. When the Crawford County Court established the town as the county seat, they named it Steelville in honor of James Steel[1][8].

6. The deed for the land was recorded on December 18, 1835, officially establishing Steelville[1].

7. James Steel is considered the founding father of Steelville[1][9].

It's worth noting that while James Steel was instrumental in founding the town, he did not remain there long-term. According to census records, he moved northward to pursue his interests in mining after establishing Steelville[1].

The name "Steelville" has remained unchanged since its founding, serving as a lasting tribute to James Steel's role in establishing this Missouri town[8].
