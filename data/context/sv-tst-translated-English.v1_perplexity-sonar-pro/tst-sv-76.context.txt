Magnar Solberg won one silver medal in the biathlon relay event at the Olympics. Specifically:

At the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, Solberg was part of the Norwegian team that won the silver medal in the 4 x 7.5 km relay event[1][3]. This was Norway's only relay medal during Solberg's Olympic career.

In his other Olympic appearance in 1972, Solberg competed in the relay again but the Norwegian team finished 4th, just missing out on a medal[1].

So in total, Magnar Solberg's Olympic relay medal count stands at:
1 silver medal (1968)

It's worth noting that while Solberg had great individual success, winning gold medals in the 20 km event in both 1968 and 1972[1][3], his relay achievements were more limited to that single silver medal in 1968.
