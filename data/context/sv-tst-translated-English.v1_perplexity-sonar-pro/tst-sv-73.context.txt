The chestnut bamboo rat, also known as the lesser bamboo rat (Cannomys badius), has the following dimensions:

Body length (without tail): 15 to 27 cm (5.9 to 10.6 inches)[1][2]

Tail length: 6 to 8 cm (2.4 to 3.1 inches)[1][2]

Total length (including tail): 21 to 35 cm (8.3 to 13.8 inches)

The lesser bamboo rat is smaller than other bamboo rat species in the genus Rhizomys. For comparison:

- Rhizomys species (including the Chinese, hoary, and large bamboo rats) have body lengths of 23 to 50 cm (9.1 to 19.7 inches) and tail lengths of 5 to 20 cm (2 to 7.9 inches)[1][3].

It's worth noting that there can be some variation in size within the species. Some sources report slightly different measurements:

- One source indicates that the body length of Cannomys badius can range from 16.3 to 45.7 cm (6.4 to 18 inches)[10].

The chestnut bamboo rat is characterized by its robust, cylindrical body, small ears and eyes, and short, stout legs[1]. Its fur is long and dense, ranging in color from chestnut brown to bright pale gray[1][2]. This coloration, along with its size, helps distinguish it from other bamboo rat species.
