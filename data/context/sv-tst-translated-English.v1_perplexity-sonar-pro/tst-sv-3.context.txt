HJK Helsinki won their first Finnish championship in 1911[1][4]. This was during the early years of organized football competition in Finland. At that time, the Finnish championship was determined through a knockout cup competition rather than a league format[3]. HJK defeated ÅIFK 7-1 in the final to claim their first title[10].

Some key points about HJK's early history and first championship:

1. The club was founded in 1907 by Fredrik Wathén[4].

2. The first Finnish national football competition was held in 1908[10].

3. HJK quickly established themselves as one of the dominant clubs in Finnish football during the 1910s and 1920s[4].

4. After their initial championship in 1911, HJK went on to win four more titles in the 1910s alone (1912, 1917, 1918, 1919)[1].

5. The league format was not introduced in Finnish football until 1930. Before that, from 1908 to 1929, the championship was decided through a knockout cup competition[3].

This 1911 championship marked the beginning of HJK's long and successful history in Finnish football. They have since become the most successful club in Finland, with a total of 33 championship titles as of 2024[4].
