The highest point in Lithuania is Aukštojas Hill, with an elevation of 293.84 meters (964.0 feet) above sea level[1][3].

Aukštojas Hill is located in the Medininkai Highlands, approximately 24 kilometers (15 miles) southeast of Lithuania's capital city, Vilnius[1]. The hill's status as the country's highest point was confirmed in 2004 when specialists from the Institute of Geodesy at Vilnius Gediminas Technical University measured its elevation using GPS technology[1][3].

Prior to this discovery, Juozapinė Hill, with an elevation of 292.7 meters (960 feet), was considered the highest point in Lithuania[1][4]. Interestingly, Aukštojas Hill and Juozapinė Hill are located only about 500 meters (1,600 feet) apart[1].

The name "Aukštojas" was chosen through a contest and officially approved in 2005[1]. It is derived from Aukštėjas (also known as Aukštojas or Aukštujis), one of the most important deities in ancient Lithuanian mythology, considered to be the creator of the world[1][5].

To enhance the site's significance and prevent any potential challenges to its status as the highest point, a 30-meter viewing platform has been constructed at the summit[9]. This tower allows visitors to enjoy panoramic views of the surrounding Lithuanian landscape, although interestingly, the nearby trees are actually taller than the viewing platform itself[9].
