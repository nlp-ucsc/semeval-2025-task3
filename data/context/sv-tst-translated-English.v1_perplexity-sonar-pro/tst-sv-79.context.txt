The Aston Martin V12 Vanquish is equipped with a 5.9-liter (5935 cc) V12 engine[1][4][7]. This large displacement engine provides impressive performance for the luxury sports car:

- The engine produces 565 horsepower at 6750 rpm and 620 Nm of torque at 5500 rpm[1].
- It has 12 cylinders arranged in a V configuration, with 4 valves per cylinder for a total of 48 valves[1][4].
- The engine uses a direct fuel injection system[4].
- It is naturally aspirated, without turbocharging or supercharging[4].

This powerful V12 engine allows the Vanquish to achieve impressive performance figures:

- 0-60 mph acceleration in 3.6 seconds for the coupe version[1].
- A top speed of 323 km/h (201 mph)[1].

The engine is positioned in the front of the car and drives the rear wheels, providing a classic front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout typical of high-performance grand tourers[7].

It's worth noting that Aston Martin has continued to use and refine this V12 engine over multiple generations of the Vanquish. The latest iteration for the 2025 model year features a 5.2-liter twin-turbocharged V12 producing even more power - 823 horsepower and 738 pound-feet of torque[3][8][9].
