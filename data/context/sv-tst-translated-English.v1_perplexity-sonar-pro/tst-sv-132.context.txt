Gelon became the ruler of Syracuse in 485 BC[1][2][3]. 

Gelon had previously been the tyrant of Gela from 491-485 BC[1][2]. In 485 BC, he took advantage of political turmoil in Syracuse to seize control of that city[1][2]. Specifically, the aristocratic landowners of Syracuse (called the gamoroi) had been driven out by the common people[2]. Gelon used this opportunity to intervene, ostensibly to help restore the exiled aristocrats[1]. However, once he entered the city, he instead made himself the new tyrant of Syracuse[1][2].

After taking control of Syracuse, Gelon left his brother Hieron to rule over their former city of Gela[1][3]. Gelon then focused on building up Syracuse as his new capital and power base[1][2]. He forcibly relocated many people from other conquered cities to Syracuse to increase its population and power[1]. Under Gelon's rule, Syracuse grew rapidly in size and influence, becoming the dominant Greek city in Sicily[2].
