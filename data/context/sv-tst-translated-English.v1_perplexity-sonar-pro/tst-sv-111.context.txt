Bert Olmstead played as a left winger in the National Hockey League (NHL)[1][2]. He was known for his physical playing style and earned the nickname "Dirty Bertie" to compensate for his less-than-stellar skating abilities[7].

Olmstead had a successful 14-year career in the NHL, playing for three teams:

1. Chicago Black Hawks (1949-1951)[1][2]
2. Montreal Canadiens (1951-1958)[1][2]
3. Toronto Maple Leafs (1959-1962)[1][2]

During his career, Olmstead established himself as a skilled offensive player, particularly excelling in setting up goals for his teammates. This is evident from his career statistics:

- 181 goals
- 421 assists
- 602 total points[1][3]

His ability to create scoring opportunities for others is highlighted by the fact that he led the league in assists twice:
- In the 1954-55 season with 48 assists
- In the 1955-56 season with 56 assists, which was a league record at the time[2]

Olmstead's physical play and offensive contributions helped him win the Stanley Cup five times - four with the Montreal Canadiens (1953, 1956, 1957, 1958) and once with the Toronto Maple Leafs (1962)[2][3].

In recognition of his outstanding career, Bert Olmstead was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1985[2][3].
