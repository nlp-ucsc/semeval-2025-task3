The Second Council of Nicaea, held in 787 AD, made several important decisions regarding holy images (icons) in Christian worship:

1. Affirmation of images: The council declared that the production and use of religious images was permissible and should be encouraged[7][9]. This overturned previous iconoclastic policies that had banned religious imagery.

2. Veneration vs. adoration: The council made a crucial distinction between the veneration (reverence) of images and the adoration of God. It stated that icons deserve reverence and veneration, but not adoration, which is reserved for God alone[7][2].

3. Theological basis: The council affirmed that the honor given to an image passes to its prototype. This means that when venerating an icon, the faithful are actually honoring the person depicted, not the physical object itself[4].

4. Tradition and Scripture: The council declared that the use of images was in line with both written and unwritten ecclesiastical traditions. They argued that this practice was consistent with apostolic teaching and the tradition of the Catholic Church[4][1].

5. Mandatory use: The council decreed that images should be placed in churches, on sacred vessels, vestments, walls, and panels[9].

6. Relics: It was also decreed that every altar should contain a relic, a tradition that has been maintained in both Catholic and Orthodox churches[7].

7. Anathemas: The council issued anathemas (formal ecclesiastical curses) against those who rejected the use of images or called them idols[6][9].

8. Distinction in worship: The council introduced terms to distinguish between types of worship: proskynesis for the veneration of images, and latria for the worship reserved for God alone[2].

These decisions effectively ended the first phase of the Byzantine Iconoclasm, though the controversy would resurface in later years. The council's rulings have been accepted by both the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches, but were rejected by many Protestant reformers during the Reformation period[2][5].
