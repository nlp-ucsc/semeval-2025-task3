The extension of the Groninger Museum in the 1990s was not designed by a single architecture firm, but rather by multiple architects and designers working in collaboration. The new postmodern building, completed in 1994, was a result of contributions from several notable architects and designers:

1. Alessandro Mendini: He was the lead architect for the overall project and designed the central yellow tower pavilion. Mendini was responsible for coordinating the different elements of the museum[1][5].

2. Philippe Starck: The French designer created the silver cylindrical building that forms part of the museum complex[5][7].

3. Coop Himmelb(l)au: This Austrian architectural firm, led by Wolf D. Prix and Helmut Swiczinsky, designed the East Pavilion, which is characterized by its pale blue deconstructivist style[3][5][7].

4. Michele de Lucchi: Although not mentioned in the search results, de Lucchi is often cited as one of the contributors to the museum's design.

The project was initiated by Frans Haks, the museum director at the time, who wanted to create an extravagant and unconventional museum building. Haks specifically sought out non-architects to create conceptual studies for the museum[5][7].

It's worth noting that the original plan included American artist Frank Stella, who was initially approached to design one of the pavilions. However, his proposal was deemed too expensive as he wanted to construct the entire structure out of Teflon. As a result, Coop Himmelb(l)au was invited to replace Stella for that commission[5][7].

The collaborative nature of this project, involving multiple designers and architects, resulted in a striking and diverse postmodern building that has become an iconic part of Groningen's cityscape. The museum's design, with its bold colors and contrasting architectural styles, reflects the eclectic and innovative approach that characterized postmodern architecture of the 1990s[1][5][7].
