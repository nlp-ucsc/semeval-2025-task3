Ben Johnson received the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance as Sam the Lion in the film "The Last Picture Show" in 1972[1][2]. 

This role was a significant milestone in Johnson's career, as it not only earned him the BAFTA Award but also several other prestigious accolades. For the same performance, he won the Academy Award (Oscar) for Best Supporting Actor, a Golden Globe Award, and the New York Film Critics Award[3].

The film "The Last Picture Show," directed by Peter Bogdanovich, was a coming-of-age drama set in a small Texas town in the 1950s. Johnson's portrayal of Sam the Lion, the philosophical owner of a pool hall, was widely praised and considered the apex of his acting career[6].

Interestingly, Johnson initially had reservations about taking the role. He found the script to be "the worst thing I ever read" and only agreed to do it after being persuaded by legendary director John Ford[3]. Johnson also negotiated to rewrite his lines to remove profanity, demonstrating his commitment to his personal values even as he took on this career-defining role.

This BAFTA win was part of a remarkable sweep of major acting awards for Johnson in 1972, solidifying his place in film history and recognizing his talent after decades of work in the industry, primarily in Western films.
