Feng Kai won a bronze medal in the men's 5000 meters relay event in short track speed skating at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City[1][3]. 

Specifically:

1. Feng Kai was part of the Chinese men's team that competed in the 5000 meters relay.

2. The Chinese team finished in third place, earning the bronze medal.

3. This was Feng Kai's second Olympic bronze medal in this event, as he had previously won bronze in the same 5000 meters relay at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano[3].

4. In addition to the relay, Feng Kai also competed individually in the 500 meters and 1000 meters events at the 2002 Olympics, finishing 4th and 10th respectively[3].

It's worth noting that the 5000 meters relay is a team event in short track speed skating, where four skaters from each team take turns racing around the track. Feng Kai's bronze medal performance was thus achieved as part of the Chinese national team effort in this relay race.
