The human eye socket, also known as the orbit, is approximately 40-45 mm (1.57-1.77 inches) deep[2][3]. This depth extends from the orbital opening at the front of the skull to the optic canal at the back of the orbit.

To provide more context about the eye socket's dimensions:

1. Volume: The orbit has a volume of about 30 cubic centimeters (approximately 2 tablespoons), which is roughly the size of a golf ball[3].

2. Shape: The orbit has a cone-like shape, with the wider opening at the front of the skull and narrowing towards the back where the optic nerve exits[2].

3. Contents: While the eyeball itself occupies only about 25% of the orbital volume, the remaining space contains various important structures[2]:
   - Extraocular muscles
   - Blood vessels
   - Nerves
   - Fat tissue

4. Eyeball size in relation to the orbit: The adult human eyeball is approximately 24 millimeters (0.94 inches) in diameter[2][4]. This means that a significant portion of the eye socket's depth is occupied by the eyeball itself, with the remaining space behind it accommodating the optic nerve and other structures.

5. Orbital bones: The eye socket is formed by seven different bones that come together to create this protective housing for the eye[3]. These bones vary in thickness, with the back and front being thicker for added protection.

Understanding the depth and overall dimensions of the eye socket is crucial in various medical contexts, including ophthalmology, maxillofacial surgery, and the design of protective eyewear.
