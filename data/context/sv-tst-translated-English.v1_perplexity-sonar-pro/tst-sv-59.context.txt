At the 2012 Olympic Games in London, María Espinoza won a bronze medal in taekwondo in the women's heavyweight (+67 kg) category[1][3]. She shared the bronze medal with Anastasia Baryshnikova of Russia, as taekwondo awards two bronze medals in each weight class[1].

To earn this bronze medal, Espinoza had to go through the repechage process after losing in the quarterfinals. Her path to the bronze included:

1. Defeating Sorn Davin of Cambodia in the round of 16[3].
2. Losing to Milica Mandić of Serbia in the quarterfinals[3].
3. Entering the repechage, where she defeated Talitiga Crawley of Samoa[3].
4. Winning the bronze medal match against Glenhis Hernández of Cuba[3].

This bronze medal was significant as it made Espinoza the first Mexican woman to win multiple Olympic medals[3]. It also added to her impressive Olympic record, following her gold medal performance at the 2008 Beijing Olympics[1][3].

Additionally, Espinoza had the honor of being Mexico's flag bearer at both the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2012 London Olympics[3], highlighting her status as one of Mexico's most prominent athletes.
