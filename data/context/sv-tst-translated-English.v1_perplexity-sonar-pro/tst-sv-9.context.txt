The castle ruin in Pennard is called Pennard Castle[1][2][3]. It is a ruined medieval castle located near the modern village of Pennard on the Gower Peninsula in south Wales[1][3][5].

Pennard Castle was originally built in the early 12th century as a timber ringwork fortification following the Norman invasion of Wales[1][3]. In the late 13th or early 14th century, the castle was rebuilt in stone by the Braose family, who added stone walls and a gatehouse[1][3][5].

The castle occupies a dramatic position on a limestone spur overlooking Three Cliffs Bay and the mouth of the Pennard Pill stream[4][5]. While its location provided excellent natural defenses on the north and west sides, the castle was ultimately abandoned in the late 14th century due to encroaching sand dunes[1][3][5].

Today, the ruins of Pennard Castle consist primarily of sections of the curtain walls, parts of the gatehouse, and the remains of a square tower[2][3]. The site is now protected as a Grade II* listed building and is open to the public, offering visitors impressive views of the surrounding landscape[2][4].
