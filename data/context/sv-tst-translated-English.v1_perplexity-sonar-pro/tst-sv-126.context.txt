Émile Cohl is widely credited with creating the first true animated film, titled "Fantasmagorie," which was released in 1908[2][4][6]. This groundbreaking work is considered by film historians to be the first animated cartoon[4][6].

"Fantasmagorie" was a short film that ran for about 1 minute and 45 seconds, including titles[6]. The animation consisted of simple stick figure characters and objects that morphed and transformed in surreal ways[4]. Cohl created the film by drawing each frame on paper and then shooting each frame onto negative film, which gave the final product a blackboard-like appearance[4]. The film comprised approximately 700 drawings, each of which was double-exposed, resulting in its nearly two-minute runtime[4].

While Cohl is recognized for creating the first animated film, it's important to note that there were earlier experiments and contributions to the field of animation:

1. In 1888, Charles-Emile Reynaud invented the Théâtre Optique, which could project a strip of pictures onto a screen. His first animated feature, "Pauvre Pierrot," debuted in 1892[1].

2. J. Stuart Blackton created "Humorous Phases of Funny Faces" in 1906, which is considered the earliest surviving animated film shot on standard motion picture film[1][5].

3. Arthur Melbourne-Cooper produced "Dreams of Toyland" in 1908, an early example of stop-motion animation[3].

These early works laid the foundation for animation as an art form, but Cohl's "Fantasmagorie" is generally recognized as the first fully realized animated film due to its use of hand-drawn animation techniques and its narrative structure. Cohl's work paved the way for future animators and helped establish animation as a distinct form of filmmaking[2].
