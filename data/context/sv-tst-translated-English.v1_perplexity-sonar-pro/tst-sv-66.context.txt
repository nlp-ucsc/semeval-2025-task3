The Korean harvest festival falls on the 15th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar and is called Chuseok (추석)[1][3]. 

Chuseok, which literally means "autumn evening," is one of the most important and widely celebrated holidays in Korea[1][3]. It is also known by other names such as Hangawi (한가위) and Jungchujeol (중추절)[4].

This major mid-autumn harvest festival is typically a three-day holiday in South Korea, including the day before and after the main Chuseok day[1][3]. In North Korea, however, they only celebrate for the day of Chuseok itself[1].

The date of Chuseok varies each year on the Gregorian calendar, as it is based on the lunar calendar. It usually falls in September or October[5]. For example:

- In 2024, Chuseok will be celebrated from September 16 to 18[4].
- In 2025, it will fall from October 5 to 8[4].
- In 2026, the festival will take place from September 24 to 26[4].

Chuseok is often compared to Thanksgiving in Western cultures, though it has its own unique traditions and significance in Korean culture[3]. It's a time for families to gather, honor their ancestors, and celebrate the year's harvest under the full moon[1][5].
