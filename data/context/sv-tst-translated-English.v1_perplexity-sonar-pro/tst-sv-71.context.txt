Cape Verde first participated in the Olympic Games in 1996 at the Summer Olympics held in Atlanta, USA[1][2][4]. This marked the beginning of Cape Verde's Olympic journey, and they have since sent athletes to every Summer Olympic Games held since then[1][4].

Some key details about Cape Verde's Olympic debut and subsequent participation:

1. First delegation: In 1996, Cape Verde sent a four-athlete delegation to Atlanta[7]. This remains their largest delegation to date.

2. Inaugural athletes: The first Cape Verdean Olympians were:
   - Alfayaya Embalo (male runner)
   - Henry Andrade (male runner)
   - António Zeferino (male runner)
