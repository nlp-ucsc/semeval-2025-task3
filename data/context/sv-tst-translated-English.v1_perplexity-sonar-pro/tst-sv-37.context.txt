Marko Kiprusoff played a total of 51 NHL games in his career[5][6]. 

Specifically:
- He played 24 games for the Montreal Canadiens in the 1995-96 season[5][6].
- He played 27 games for the New York Islanders in the 2001-02 season[5][6].

Kiprusoff's NHL career was relatively brief, as he spent most of his professional hockey career playing in European leagues, particularly in Finland's SM-liiga with TPS Turku[1][2]. He had two short stints in the NHL, first with Montreal and then with New York, but didn't make a significant impact in the league[1]. After his time in the NHL, he returned to Europe to continue his professional career, playing in various leagues including Switzerland's NLA and Finland's SM-liiga[1][2].
