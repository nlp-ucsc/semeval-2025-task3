Theano, the Greek philosopher, lived in the 6th century BCE[1][2][3]. She is believed to have been born around 546 BCE[2][3]. 

Theano was associated with the Pythagorean school of philosophy in southern Italy. She is most commonly known as the wife of the famous Greek mathematician and philosopher Pythagoras, though some sources describe her as his student instead[1]. 

Pythagoras himself was born around 582 BCE and died around 500 BCE[3]. He established his philosophical school in Croton, a Greek colony in southern Italy, around 531 BCE when he was about 56 years old[3][7]. Theano, who was much younger than Pythagoras, became involved with his school at this time[7].

After Pythagoras' death, which occurred sometime around 500-495 BCE, Theano is said to have continued running the Pythagorean school[3][5]. She lived well into the 5th century BCE, with some sources suggesting she may have lived until around 350 BCE[2], though this late date seems unlikely given her birth year.

It's important to note that there is some uncertainty and conflicting information in ancient sources regarding the details of Theano's life. However, the consensus places her as a prominent figure in the late 6th and early 5th centuries BCE, associated with the Pythagorean school of thought.
