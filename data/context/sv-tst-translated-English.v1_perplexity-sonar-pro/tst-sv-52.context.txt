The political movement founded by Hugo Chávez is known as Chavismo. 

Chavismo, also referred to as Chavism or Chavezism in English, is a left-wing populist political ideology based on the ideas, programs, and governing style of Hugo Chávez, who served as President of Venezuela from 1999 to 2013[2]. The movement combines elements of democratic socialism, socialist patriotism, Bolivarianism, and Latin American integration[2].

Key aspects of Chavismo include:

1. Political organization: Initially, Chávez founded the Fifth Republic Movement (Movimiento V [Quinta] República, MVR) in July 1997 to support his 1998 presidential candidacy[3][4]. The MVR later dissolved in 2007 to become part of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV)[4].

2. Ideology: Chavismo is committed to the Bolivarian Revolution, claiming to be the political voice of Venezuela's poor. It pursues radical anti-Americanism and elements of Marxism[3].

3. Policies: Chavismo advocates for nationalization, social welfare programs (known as Bolivarian missions), and opposition to neoliberal economic policies[2][7].

4. International focus: The movement promotes Latin American integration and opposes what it perceives as U.S. imperialism in the region[7].

5. Historical roots: Chavismo draws inspiration from Simón Bolívar, the 19th-century Venezuelan revolutionary leader, and aims to build an inter-American coalition to implement Bolivarianism, nationalism, and a state-led economy[7].

The Chavismo movement has had a significant impact on Venezuelan politics and society, as well as influencing left-wing movements across Latin America. However, it has also been associated with increasing authoritarianism and economic challenges in Venezuela, particularly following Chávez's death in 2013[7][10].
