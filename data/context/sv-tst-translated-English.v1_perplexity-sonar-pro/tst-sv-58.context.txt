Based on the search results provided, there is no definitive information about which arrondissement Saint-Clément is located in. The search results mention several different places named Saint-Clément in France, but they don't provide consistent information about their administrative divisions. Here's what we can gather:

1. There is a Saint-Clément in the Gard department in southern France[6]. However, the arrondissement is not specified.

2. Another Saint-Clément is mentioned in the Ardèche department, which is in the Rhône-Alpes region. This Saint-Clément is in the arrondissement of Tournon-sur-Rhône[7].

3. There's also a Saint-Clément-des-Levées mentioned, which is located along the Loire River[5]. However, its arrondissement is not provided.

4. The search results also mention a Saint-Clément associated with a faience factory near Lunéville[2], but again, no arrondissement is specified.

Given the inconsistent information and the fact that there are multiple locations in France named Saint-Clément, it's not possible to definitively state which arrondissement "Saint-Clément" is in without more specific information about which Saint-Clément is being referred to.

If you're looking for information about a specific Saint-Clément, it would be helpful to know which department or region of France it's located in. This would allow for a more accurate answer regarding its arrondissement.
