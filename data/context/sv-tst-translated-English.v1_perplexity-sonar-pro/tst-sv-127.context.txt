The current drummer for Kaiser Chiefs is Vijay Mistry, who joined the band in 2013[3]. However, the band's original drummer and founding member was Nick Hodgson, who played with Kaiser Chiefs from their formation in 2003 until his departure in late 2012[1][3].

Nick Hodgson was a significant figure in the band's early success. He was not only the drummer but also a backing vocalist and primary songwriter for Kaiser Chiefs[1]. Hodgson co-wrote many of the band's hit songs, including "I Predict a Riot" and "Ruby"[1]. He left the band in December 2012 to focus on other projects and his songwriting career[1][4].

After Hodgson's departure, Kaiser Chiefs announced on February 7, 2013, that Vijay Mistry, formerly of the band Club Smith, would be joining as their new drummer[3]. Mistry has been with the band since then, playing on their albums from "Education, Education, Education & War" (2014) onwards[3][4].

Since leaving Kaiser Chiefs, Nick Hodgson has continued his career in music. He has worked as a songwriter for various artists and has also formed a new band called Everyone Says Hi[5][6][7]. In 2024, Hodgson confirmed details of his new band's debut album and upcoming shows[8].
