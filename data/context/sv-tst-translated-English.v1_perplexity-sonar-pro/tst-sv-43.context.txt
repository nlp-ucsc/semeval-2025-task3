Domantas Sabonis played for Lithuania in the 2016 Olympic Games held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil[1][2][3].

Sabonis, the son of basketball legend Arvydas Sabonis, made his Olympic debut for Lithuania in the 2016 Rio Olympics. He was part of the Lithuanian national team that continued the country's streak of participating in every Summer Olympics since regaining independence[1].

In the 2016 Olympics, Sabonis played in all six games for Lithuania, averaging 5.5 points and 4.5 rebounds per game[5]. At the time, he was the youngest player ever to play for the Lithuanian national team, narrowly beating Jonas Valančiūnas for that distinction[7].

Lithuania has a strong Olympic basketball tradition, having won medals in previous Games. The 2016 Olympics marked Lithuania's seventh consecutive appearance at the Summer Games in the post-Soviet era[2]. For Sabonis, participating in the Olympics was particularly significant given his family's history with the Games - his father Arvydas had won medals in previous Olympics[1].

Domantas Sabonis's participation in the 2016 Olympics came shortly after he was drafted into the NBA. He was selected as the 11th overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft by the Orlando Magic and then traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder on draft night[5][7].
