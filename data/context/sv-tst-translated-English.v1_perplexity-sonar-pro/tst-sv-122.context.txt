"Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!" was directed by Russ Meyer[1][2][4]. Meyer was an American film director, producer, screenwriter, cinematographer, and editor known for his sexploitation films that often featured campy humor, satire, and large-breasted women[4].

Russ Meyer wrote, directed, and edited "Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!"[6]. The film was released in 1965 and has since become a cult classic[1][2]. Meyer conceived the idea for the film as a follow-up to his earlier work "Motorpsycho," deciding to create a movie about "three bad girls" instead of "three bad boys"[2].

Despite its initial commercial failure and critical dismissal, "Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!" gained popularity over time, particularly after filmmaker John Waters praised it in his 1981 autobiography[1]. Waters called it "the best movie ever made" and dubbed Meyer "the Eisenstein of sex films" for his skillful editing techniques[1].

The film follows three go-go dancers on a violent spree in the California desert, featuring Meyer's signature style of over-the-top characters, provocative themes, and dynamic cinematography[2][5]. While it contains less explicit content than some of Meyer's other works, it's notable for its strong female characters, particularly Tura Satana in the lead role of Varla[1][5].
