Cedric Liddell received an Olympic bronze medal in the men's coxed eight rowing event[6][9]. This achievement occurred at the 1932 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles[6][9][10]. Specifically, Liddell was part of the Canadian rowing team that secured third place in the eights competition[9][10].

It's worth noting that Cedric Liddell participated in two Olympic Games:

1. At the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics, where he won the bronze medal in the coxed eight event[6][9][10].
2. At the 1936 Berlin Olympics, where he again competed in the coxed eight event, but the Canadian team finished in 9th place[6].

Rowing, particularly in team events like the coxed eight, requires exceptional coordination, strength, and teamwork. Liddell's Olympic medal in this challenging discipline represents a significant athletic achievement for both him and the Canadian rowing team of that era.
