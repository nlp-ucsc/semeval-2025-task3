Nimravidae lived from the Middle Eocene through the Late Miocene epochs, spanning approximately 33.2 million years[1]. Specifically:

- The earliest nimravid fossils date back to about 40.4 million years ago, during the Bartonian stage of the Middle Eocene[1].

- The last known nimravid fossils are from around 7.2 million years ago, during the Tortonian stage of the Late Miocene[1].

Some key points about the timeline of Nimravidae:

- They first appeared in North America and Asia during the middle of the Eocene epoch, around 40 million years ago[2].

- Nimravids flourished during the Oligocene epoch, thriving in the changing climate as forests transformed into more open woodlands[2].

- Their diversity appears to have peaked around 28 million years ago[1].

- By the Miocene, nimravids were in decline. Out of nine established nimravid genera known in 2012, only three had fossils dating to the Miocene[2].

- The last known nimravid genus to survive was Pogonodon, with fossils found from the Tortonian period of the late Miocene[2].

- No nimravid remains have been found from later than about 9 million years ago[2].

The extinction of nimravids coincided with global climate changes that led to the spread of grasslands and savannas, which may have favored other predator groups better adapted to hunting in open environments[2]. Competition from new predators like amphicyonids ("bear dogs") and the emergence of true cats may have also contributed to their decline[2][4].
