Alvignac is located in the Occitanie region of France[1][2]. Specifically, it is situated in the Lot department, which is part of the Occitanie region[1][2]. 

The town is positioned in the northern part of the Lot department, in an area known as Haut-Quercy[2]. Alvignac's location is notable for being equidistant from two popular tourist attractions in the region - Rocamadour and Padirac[2].

Historically, Alvignac was part of the former region of Midi-Pyrénées[1], which has since been incorporated into the larger Occitanie region as part of France's territorial reform. This change took effect on January 1, 2016, when several regions were merged to create larger administrative units.

Alvignac's position in the Occitanie region places it in the southern part of France, in an area known for its rich history, beautiful landscapes, and numerous tourist attractions. The region of Occitanie itself stretches from the Pyrenees mountains in the south to the Massif Central in the north, encompassing a diverse range of terrains and cultural influences.
