The German motorway A73, also known as Bundesautobahn 73 or BAB 73, begins in Suhl, a city in the state of Thuringia, Germany[1]. 

Specifically, the A73 starts at a three-way interchange with the A71 motorway near Suhl[1]. From this northern terminus, it runs southward, connecting several important cities and regions:

1. It first passes through Thuringia, connecting Suhl to the Bavarian border.

2. After entering Bavaria, it continues south through Coburg and Bamberg.

3. The motorway then extends further south to Erlangen and the Nuremberg/FÃ¼rth area.

4. Finally, it terminates at a three-way interchange with the A9 motorway near Feucht, south of Nuremberg[1].

The A73 is a significant north-south route in eastern Germany, spanning approximately 167 kilometers (104 miles) from Suhl to Feucht[4]. It's particularly important for connecting the regions of Thuringia and Franconia, facilitating travel and commerce between these areas.

Interestingly, the section between Bamberg and Nuremberg is known as the Frankenschnellweg (Franconian Expressway), highlighting its importance to the Franconian region of Bavaria[1].
