Paul Egede lived for 80 years, from September 9, 1708 to June 6, 1789[1][2][6].

Born in Kabelv√•g, Norway, Paul Egede was a significant figure in the Lutheran mission to Greenland. He followed in the footsteps of his father, Hans Egede, who established the mission in 1721. Paul's life was dedicated to theological work, missionary activities, and scholarly pursuits, particularly focused on the Kalaallit people of Greenland[1].

Throughout his long life, Egede made several notable contributions:

1. Missionary work: He spent many years in Greenland, continuing and expanding the mission his father started[1].

2. Linguistic achievements: Egede translated the New Testament into Kalaallisut, the language of West Greenland Inuit. He also published a Kalaallisut-Danish-Latin dictionary in 1750, a revised Kalaallisut catechism in 1756, and a Kalaallisut grammar in 1760[1].

3. Ecclesiastical positions: In 1742, he became the Minister of the Vartov Lutheran Church in Copenhagen. Later, in 1779, he was elevated to the position of Bishop of Greenland[1].

4. Academic contributions: In 1747, Egede became a professor of theology at the Greenland Mission Seminary and later its provost in 1758. He was also made a fellow of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters in 1785[1].

Paul Egede's eight decades of life were filled with significant accomplishments in missionary work, linguistics, and theology, leaving a lasting impact on the Lutheran mission in Greenland and the study of the Kalaallisut language.
