Vocal cord polyps are benign, fluid-filled growths that develop on the vocal cords. They typically form as a result of chronic misuse or overuse of the voice[1][7]. These growths can occur on one or both vocal cords and may vary in size and shape, ranging from small blister-like formations to larger stalk-like growths[1][7].

The main symptoms of vocal cord polyps include:

1. Hoarseness or changes in voice quality
2. Difficulty producing certain sounds
3. Increased effort to speak
4. Persistent throat irritation
5. Inability to sustain vocal tone[1]

Treatment for vocal cord polyps generally involves a combination of approaches:

1. Voice therapy: This is often the first line of treatment. A speech-language pathologist works with the patient to improve vocal techniques, reduce vocal strain, and teach proper voice use[2][3].

2. Voice rest: Resting the voice can help reduce irritation and allow the vocal cords to heal[5].

3. Lifestyle changes: Patients are advised to avoid behaviors that contribute to polyp formation, such as excessive talking, shouting, or singing without proper technique[1].

4. Medication: In some cases, medications may be prescribed to help reduce irritation of the vocal folds[1].

5. Surgery: If conservative treatments are not effective, surgical removal of the polyp may be necessary. This is typically done through a procedure called microlaryngoscopy, where a small tube (laryngoscope) is inserted into the mouth to access and remove the polyp using special instruments or lasers[1][2].

Post-treatment care is crucial for optimal recovery:

1. After surgery, patients are usually placed on voice rest for a short period[2].
2. Voice therapy is often recommended following surgery to help prevent recurrence and improve vocal techniques[2][5].
3. Patients are advised to maintain good vocal hygiene, stay hydrated, and avoid irritants like smoking[5].

It's important to note that while surgery can be effective, it's not always the first choice. Many cases of vocal cord polyps can be managed successfully with conservative treatments, especially if caught early[8]. The choice of treatment depends on factors such as the size and location of the polyp, the severity of symptoms, and the patient's overall health and voice use requirements.
