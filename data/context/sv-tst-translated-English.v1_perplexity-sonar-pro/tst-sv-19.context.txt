Pseudomugil gertrudae was first described by Max Wilhelm Carl Weber in 1911[2][4]. Weber was a Professor of Zoology at the University of Amsterdam[2]. The species was named "gertrudae" after Gertrude Merton, the wife of Dr. Hugo Merton, a German naturalist who traveled through the Aru Islands between October 1907 and August 1908[2][4]. The original specimens of Pseudomugil gertrudae were collected from Terangan Island, one of the Aru Islands, which lies directly south of the Vogelkop Peninsula in western New Guinea[2].
