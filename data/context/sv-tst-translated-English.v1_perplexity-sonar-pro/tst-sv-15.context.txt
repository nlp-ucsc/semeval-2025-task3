In the 1990s, Mesoplodon traversii was mistakenly described as a new species and given the name Mesoplodon bahamondi[1][2]. This occurred when a damaged calvaria (top of the skull) was found washed up on Robinson Crusoe Island, Chile in 1993. The specimen was described as a new species called Mesoplodon bahamondi, also known as Bahamonde's beaked whale[2].

However, subsequent DNA sequence and morphological comparisons revealed that this specimen, along with earlier finds from New Zealand, all belonged to the same species. A 2002 study showed that these specimens were actually Mesoplodon traversii, which had been originally described by Gray in 1874[1]. As Mesoplodon traversii was the older name, it took priority over Mesoplodon bahamondi according to the rules of zoological nomenclature.

This misidentification highlights the challenges in identifying and classifying beaked whales, especially when working with limited or fragmentary specimens. The spade-toothed whale (Mesoplodon traversii) is considered one of the rarest and least known cetacean species, with only a handful of confirmed specimens known to science[2][5].
