The movie Tuck Everlasting is based on the novel of the same name, "Tuck Everlasting," written by Natalie Babbitt[1][2]. This American children's novel about immortality was originally published in 1975 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux[5]. The book has been highly successful, selling over 5 million copies and is considered a classic of modern children's literature[5].

The story revolves around the Tuck family, who gained immortality after drinking from a magical spring, and their encounter with a young girl named Winnie Foster. The novel explores themes of life, death, and the consequences of living forever[1][2].

The book has been adapted into two feature films:

1. A 1981 version
2. A more widely known 2002 version[5]

The 2002 film adaptation, which is likely the one most people are familiar with, expanded on some elements of the book while maintaining its core story. For instance, in the movie, Winnie is portrayed as 15 years old, whereas in the book she is 10[1]. This change was made to make the romantic subplot between Winnie and Jesse more age-appropriate for the film audience[1].

Despite some differences between the book and the movie adaptations, both explore the central themes and story of the Tuck family's immortality and their impact on young Winnie Foster's life[1][2].
