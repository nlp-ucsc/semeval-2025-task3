A blind arcade is a decorative architectural element consisting of a series of arches applied to the surface of a wall without any actual openings[1][2]. Key features and characteristics of blind arcades include:

1. Ornamental purpose: Blind arcades are primarily used for decoration rather than having any structural or functional role[1][5].

2. Composition: They are composed of a succession of arches with well-defined columns or piers between them[1][5].

3. Solid wall: Unlike regular arcades, blind arcades are built against a solid wall surface, with no openings behind the arches[1][2].

4. Architectural styles: Blind arcades are common decorative features in Romanesque and Gothic architecture throughout Western Europe. They are also found in Byzantine Orthodox churches in Eastern Europe and Armenian churches[1][5].

5. Variations: A related term is "blind arch," which usually refers to a single arch or a series of joined arches as a frieze[1].

Blind arcades serve several purposes in architecture:

1. Visual interest: They add texture and visual interest to otherwise plain wall surfaces[2][5].

2. Rhythm and structure: They create a sense of rhythm and structure on building facades[5].

3. Aesthetic enhancement: Blind arcades can make buildings appear more elegant and sophisticated[2].

4. Historical and cultural significance: They are often associated with specific architectural styles and periods, contributing to a building's historical character[1].

Examples of blind arcades can be found in many famous structures, including:

1. Romanesque and Gothic cathedrals across Europe[1]
2. Byzantine Orthodox churches[1]
3. Armenian churches[1]
4. The Camposanto Monumentale in Pisa, Italy[1]
5. Norwich Cathedral in Norfolk, United Kingdom[1]
6. Canterbury Cathedral in England[1]
7. The Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia[1]

In summary, blind arcades are decorative architectural elements that mimic the appearance of open arcades but are applied to solid wall surfaces, adding visual interest and historical character to buildings.
