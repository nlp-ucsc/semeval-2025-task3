Bahram I reigned as the Sasanian King of Kings of Iran from 271 to 274 CE[1][2][3][4]. 

Some key details about Bahram I's reign:

- He succeeded his brother Hormizd I, who had only ruled for about a year[1][2].

- Bahram I came to power with the support of the influential Zoroastrian priest Kartir[2][3].

- His reign marked the end of Sasanian religious tolerance towards Manichaeism. In 274 CE, with Kartir's backing, Bahram I had Mani (the founder of Manichaeism) imprisoned and executed[1][2].

- Bahram I was the eldest son of Shapur I, but had initially been ranked below his younger brothers, likely due to his mother's lower status[2].

- Prior to becoming king, Bahram I had served as the governor of Gilan, holding the title "Gelan Shah" (King of Gilan)[2][3].

- His reign was relatively brief and uneventful compared to other Sasanian rulers[2].

- Bahram I died in September 274 CE and was succeeded by his son Bahram II[2][3].

While most sources agree on the 271-274 CE timeframe, it's worth noting that the exact dates of Sasanian reigns from this period can sometimes be contested by a year or two due to limitations in surviving historical records.
