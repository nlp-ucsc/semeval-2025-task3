Pasteur is a large lunar impact crater located on the far side of the Moon. Its key characteristics are:

- Diameter: Approximately 233-235 kilometers[1][3]

- Classification: It belongs to the category termed a "walled plain" due to its large size[1]

- Location: On the far side of the Moon, just beyond the eastern limb as seen from Earth[1]

- Named after: French chemist and microbiologist Louis Pasteur[1]

- Visibility: Occasionally brought into view from Earth due to librations, though not much detail can be observed[1]

- Coordinates: Centered at approximately 11.9°S latitude, 104.6°E longitude[3]

- Age: Classified as pre-Nectarian, meaning it is one of the older lunar craters[3]

The crater's large size makes it a prominent feature on the lunar far side. For comparison, the largest crater on the near side of the Moon is Clavius, with a diameter of 235 km[5], putting Pasteur among the largest lunar craters overall.
