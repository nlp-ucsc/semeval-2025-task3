HEALTH was founded in Los Angeles in the mid-2000s by the following musicians:

- Jake Duzsik (vocals and guitar)
- John Famiglietti (bass and electronics)
- BJ Miller (drums)
- Jupiter Keyes (guitar, left the band in 2015)

The band originally formed when Jake Duzsik met John Famiglietti while they were both working at Guitar Center in Los Angeles[1][2]. They decided to start a band together and recruited Jupiter Keyes, who Duzsik knew from university, and drummer BJ Miller, who they found through Craigslist[2].

HEALTH emerged from the Los Angeles underground experimental music scene, centered around venues like The Smell[1][4]. They gained early prominence with a remix of their song "Crimewave" by Crystal Castles in 2007, before releasing their self-titled debut album that same year[1].

The band's name was chosen after the members agreed it should be an "everyday word." When reviewing a list of potential names, "health" was the only one not already taken by another band[1][2].

Since their formation, HEALTH has evolved their sound from noise rock roots to incorporate more electronic and industrial elements over the years, while maintaining their experimental edge[1][3]. The current lineup consists of Jake Duzsik, John Famiglietti, and BJ Miller, following Jupiter Keyes' departure in 2015[1].
