Adolf Galland was appointed to the rank of Generalleutnant (Lieutenant General) in November 1942 at the age of 30, making him the youngest general in the German armed forces at that time[1][4][7].

Specifically:

- Galland was born on March 19, 1912[1][4].

- In November 1942, he was promoted to the rank of Generalmajor (Major General)[7][9].

- Shortly after, likely within the same month or soon after, he was promoted again to Generalleutnant (Lieutenant General)[4][7].

- This rapid series of promotions in late 1942 occurred when Galland was 30 years old.

His meteoric rise through the ranks was due to his exceptional skills as a fighter pilot and leader. By this point in the war, Galland had already achieved over 90 aerial victories and held the position of General der Jagdflieger (General of Fighters), responsible for the Luftwaffe's entire fighter force[1][4]. His promotion to general officer rank at such a young age was remarkable and reflected both his abilities and the German military's need for experienced combat leaders as the war progressed.
