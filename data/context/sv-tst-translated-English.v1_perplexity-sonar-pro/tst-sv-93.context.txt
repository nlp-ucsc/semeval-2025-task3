Hassan Rouhani received 18,613,329 votes in the 2013 Iranian presidential election[1]. This represented 52.49% of the total votes cast, allowing him to win the election outright in the first round without requiring a runoff[1]. 

Some additional details about Rouhani's victory:

- The total number of valid votes cast was 35,458,747[1].
- Rouhani narrowly avoided a second round by receiving just over 50% of all votes cast (50.71%)[1].
- His nearest competitor, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, received 6,077,292 votes (17.14%)[1].
- Voter turnout was high at 72.71%, with 36,704,156 total votes cast out of 50,483,192 registered voters[1].

Rouhani's victory was seen as surprising by some analysts, as he was considered the most moderate of the approved candidates[2]. His win represented a desire for change among Iranian voters, with Rouhani performing well among both the middle class and youth voters[3].
