Lil Dagover was born on September 30, 1887, in Madiun, Java, which was then part of the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia)[1][2][4]. She was born to German parents, with her birth name being Marie Antonia Siegelinde Martha Seubert[1][4]. Her father, Adolf Karl Ludwig Moritz Seubert, was a forest ranger in the service of the Dutch colonial authorities[1][2].

Some key details about her birth and early life:

1. Her birthplace is sometimes referred to as Madiven or Madiwen, which are alternate spellings or names for Madiun[2][5].

2. While she was born in Java, Dagover was of German nationality[5].

3. Throughout her career, Dagover misrepresented her age, claiming to be ten years younger than she actually was. It wasn't until after her death that her true birth year of 1887 was confirmed[2].

4. At the age of ten, in 1897, she was sent back to Europe for her education, attending boarding schools in Baden-Baden, Weimar, and Geneva, Switzerland[1][2].

5. She was orphaned at the age of 13 and spent the rest of her adolescence with friends and relatives in Europe[1].

This background in the Dutch East Indies and her subsequent education in Europe played a significant role in shaping her early life before she embarked on her successful career as a prominent actress in German cinema.
