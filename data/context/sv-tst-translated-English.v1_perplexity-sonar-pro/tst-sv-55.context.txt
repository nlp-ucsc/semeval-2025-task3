Le Mesnil-Opac was formerly located in the canton of Tessy-sur-Vire in the Manche department of Normandy, France[1][3]. However, it's important to note a few key points about Le Mesnil-Opac's current status:

1. Le Mesnil-Opac is no longer an independent commune. On January 1, 2016, it was merged into the new commune of Moyon Villages[1][8].

2. Moyon Villages was formed by the merger of three former communes: Chevry, Le Mesnil-Opac, and Moyon[8].

3. Moyon is now the administrative seat of the new Moyon Villages commune[8].

While the specific canton information for Moyon Villages is not provided in the search results, it's likely that the new commune is part of a reorganized cantonal structure following the merger. Cantons in France have undergone various reforms in recent years, so the current cantonal affiliation of Moyon Villages (which includes the former Le Mesnil-Opac) may differ from the historical canton of Tessy-sur-Vire.

For the most up-to-date information on the current cantonal affiliation of Moyon Villages (and by extension, the area formerly known as Le Mesnil-Opac), it would be best to consult official French administrative sources or contact the Manche departmental administration directly.
