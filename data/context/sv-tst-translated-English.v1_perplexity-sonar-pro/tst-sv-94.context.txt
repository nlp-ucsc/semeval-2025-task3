The alliance between Sparta, Athens, and Ptolemy II of Egypt was created in 268/267 BC through the Decree of Chremonides[1][9]. This decree, issued by the Athenian statesman and general Chremonides, formalized an anti-Macedonian coalition aimed at challenging Antigonid dominance in Greece[1].

Specifically:

1. The decree was passed in the archonship of Peithidemos, which corresponds to 269/268 BC[10].

2. Chremonides, son of Eteocles from the deme of Aithaladai, was a leading democratic politician in Athens who negotiated this alliance[7].

3. The alliance included not only Athens, Sparta, and Ptolemaic Egypt, but also other Greek city-states such as Elis, Achaea, Tegea, Mantinea, Orchomenus, Phigalia, Kaphyae, and some Cretan cities[10].

4. This coalition was formed in response to perceived Macedonian aggression and aimed to restore the independence of Greek city-states[1].

5. The alliance led to the outbreak of the Chremonidean War (267-261 BC), named after Chremonides himself[1][2].

This alliance represented a significant diplomatic effort to unite various Greek powers against Macedonian influence, with Ptolemaic Egypt providing crucial support to the Greek city-states in their struggle for autonomy[1][2].
