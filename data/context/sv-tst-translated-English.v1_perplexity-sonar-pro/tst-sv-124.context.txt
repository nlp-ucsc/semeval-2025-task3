The exact patent status of International Klein Blue (IKB) is somewhat unclear and there are conflicting claims about when and how it was officially registered.

According to several sources, Yves Klein registered IKB in France on May 19, 1960 through a Soleau envelope at the Institut national de la propriété industrielle (INPI)[1][3]. A Soleau envelope is a method of establishing the date of invention under French law, but it is not the same as a full patent.

Some sources claim Klein patented IKB in 1960[5][6][8], but do not provide specific patent details. However, there is no clear evidence of an actual patent being granted.

Other sources indicate Klein did not patent IKB, but only registered it via the Soleau envelope method[4]. The Soleau envelope Klein sent to the French government was reportedly destroyed accidentally, leaving only Klein's personal copy as evidence of the registration.

It's worth noting that Klein did patent a method for using human bodies as "living paintbrushes" around this time, which may have led to some confusion[2].

In summary, while 1960 is frequently cited as the year Klein officially registered or "patented" IKB, the exact legal status remains somewhat ambiguous. The most accurate statement may be that Klein registered IKB via Soleau envelope in France on May 19, 1960, rather than obtaining a full patent.
