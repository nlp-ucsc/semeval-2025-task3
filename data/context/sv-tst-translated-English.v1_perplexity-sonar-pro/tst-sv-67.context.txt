Sakata is located on Honshu, the largest and most populous island of Japan[1][10]. Specifically, Sakata is situated in the northwestern part of Honshu, along the coast of the Sea of Japan in Yamagata Prefecture[1][5].

Some key details about Sakata's location:

1. It is located in the coastal plains of the northwest corner of Yamagata Prefecture[1].
2. The city borders the Sea of Japan to the west and Akita Prefecture to the north[1].
3. Sakata sits at the mouth of the Mogami River, which was historically important for trade[1][5].
4. The city is positioned roughly halfway between Akita and Niigata along the Sea of Japan coast[2].
5. Mount Chokai is located on Sakata's northern border, though the urban center is in the flatlands of the Sh≈çnai Plains[1].

Interestingly, while Sakata is on the main island of Honshu, it also administers the small inhabited island of Tobishima, which is located about 39 kilometers (24 miles) off the coast in the Sea of Japan[1][3].
