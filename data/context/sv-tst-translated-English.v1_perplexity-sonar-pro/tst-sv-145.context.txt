Based on the search results, there is some uncertainty and conflicting information regarding the exact dates of Sweyn Forkbeard's and Harald Bluetooth's baptisms. However, I can provide the most commonly cited information:

Harald Bluetooth's baptism:
Harald Bluetooth was likely baptized around 965 CE[2][8]. This conversion is generally believed to have been more of a political move than a genuine spiritual transformation. Harald's baptism was reportedly performed by a German missionary named Poppo, who, according to legend, performed a miracle by carrying a red-hot iron glove without injury to convince Harald of the Christian God's power[2].

Sweyn Forkbeard's baptism:
The information about Sweyn Forkbeard's baptism is less clear and somewhat contradictory:

1. Some sources suggest that Sweyn was baptized along with his father Harald Bluetooth around 965 CE[10][3]. This would have made Sweyn about 5 years old at the time, assuming he was born around 960 CE.

2. However, other historians debate this, believing that Sweyn may have waged war against his father precisely because he disagreed with the introduction of Christianity[3].

3. There are also accounts that suggest Sweyn was baptized before Harald, though this seems less likely given the chronology of events[6].

It's important to note that while these baptisms are significant historical events, the exact details and dates are subject to debate among historians. The conversion of these Viking rulers to Christianity was often as much a political decision as a religious one, aimed at aligning themselves with the powerful Christian kingdoms to the south[2].
