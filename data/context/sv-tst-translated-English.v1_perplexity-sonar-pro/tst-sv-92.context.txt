The wings of a fully grown common guillemot (Uria aalge) extend to a wingspan of 61-73 cm (24-29 inches)[1][3][5]. This medium-sized seabird has relatively short, narrow wings that are well-adapted for both flying and underwater "flying" when diving for prey.

Some additional details about the common guillemot's wings and body size:

1. Overall body length: The common guillemot measures 38-46 cm (15-18 inches) in total body length[3].

2. Weight: Adult birds typically weigh between 945-1044 g (2 lb 1.5 oz - 2 lb 5 oz), with some sources reporting a wider range of 775-1250 g (1 lb 11.5 oz - 2 lb 12 oz)[3].

3. Wing shape: The wings are short and narrow, which helps the bird maneuver efficiently underwater when diving for fish[3][5].

4. Flight characteristics: Despite their relatively short wings, common guillemots are capable of fast direct flight, with speeds reaching up to 80 km/h (50 mph)[3].

5. Diving ability: The wing structure allows guillemots to "fly" underwater, typically diving to depths of 30-60 m (100-195 ft), with recorded depths of up to 180 m (590 ft)[3].

It's worth noting that while the common guillemot's wings are well-suited for both flying and diving, their high wing loading (2 g/cmÂ²) means they are not particularly agile in the air and may have difficulty taking off[3].
