I apologize, but I do not have any information about a place called "Fodyer" in the search results provided or in my existing knowledge. The search results do not mention any location by that name, and I cannot find any reliable information about where such a place might be located or on which continent it might exist. It's possible this could be a misspelling or refer to an obscure location, but without additional context or information, I cannot determine its location or even confirm if it is a real place. If you have any additional details or can clarify the spelling, I'd be happy to try searching again.
