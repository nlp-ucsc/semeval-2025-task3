Chichester is located in two American states: New York and New Hampshire.

In New York, Chichester is a hamlet in the town of Shandaken, Ulster County[1]. It's situated in the Catskill Mountains region and was founded in 1863 by brothers Frank and Lemuel Chichester. The hamlet is known for its unique pronunciation, where the "i" in Chichester is pronounced like "eye" rather than the short "i" sound in "chip"[1].

In New Hampshire, Chichester is a town located just east of Concord in Merrimack County[2][4]. It was established in 1727 by Governor John Wentworth, along with several surrounding towns. Chichester, New Hampshire, was named after Thomas Pelham Holles, Duke of Newcastle and Earl of Chichester, England, who was an influential politician in the 18th century and played a significant role in the relations between England and the American colonies[2].

It's worth noting that while both locations share the same name, they have distinct histories and characteristics. The New York Chichester is a small hamlet with a rich industrial past centered around a furniture factory, while the New Hampshire Chichester is a larger town with a longer history dating back to the colonial era.
