Pietro Nenni returned the Stalin Peace Prize in 1956 in protest against the Soviet invasion of Hungary[1]. 

Nenni had received the Stalin Peace Prize in 1951, which came with a monetary award of $25,000[1][3]. At the time, Nenni was aligned with the Soviet Union and had close ties to the Italian Communist Party. In fact, after receiving the prize, Nenni had traveled to meet with Stalin and proclaimed him as a man of peace[1].

However, Nenni's views changed dramatically after the Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary in 1956. This event caused Nenni to break with the Communists and shift his political stance[1][4]. The invasion was particularly embarrassing for Nenni given his previous praise of Stalin and acceptance of the peace prize named after him.

As a result, Nenni decided to return the $25,000 monetary portion of the prize as a symbolic gesture of protest against Soviet aggression[1]. This act marked a significant turning point in Nenni's political career and the orientation of the Italian Socialist Party. Following this, Nenni gradually moved his party away from its alliance with the Communists and towards support for NATO[1].

This return of the Stalin Peace Prize was part of a broader shift in Nenni's politics, as he moved the Italian Socialist Party away from its previous pro-Soviet stance towards a more centrist position in Italian politics[4]. It represented a clear break with his past support for the Soviet Union and a realignment of his political ideology in response to the events in Hungary.
