The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) regulates the basic properties of brake fluids through various directives, primarily through the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 116[1][2]. This standard is administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which is part of the Department of Transportation[2].

FMVSS No. 116 sets the minimum safety requirements for brake fluids used in hydraulic brake systems of motor vehicles in the United States[1]. The standard specifies requirements for:

1. Fluids used in hydraulic brake systems
2. Containers for these fluids
3. Labeling of the containers

The purpose of this standard is to reduce failures in hydraulic braking systems that may occur due to the manufacture or use of improper or contaminated fluid[1].

Key aspects of the DOT regulation include:

1. Classification of brake fluids into different grades (DOT 3, DOT 4, DOT 5, and DOT 5.1) based on their properties[1][4].

2. Specification of minimum requirements for various properties such as:
   - Equilibrium reflux boiling point (ERBP)
   - Wet ERBP
   - Kinematic viscosities
   - pH value
   - High-temperature stability
   - Chemical stability
   - Corrosion resistance
   - Water tolerance[1]

3. Requirements for manufacturers and packagers to self-certify that their brake fluids meet FMVSS-116 specifications[3].

4. Enforcement of these standards through random testing of products by the NHTSA[3].

The DOT regulations ensure that brake fluids sold in the United States meet specific safety and performance criteria, contributing to the overall safety of vehicles on the road[2][3].
