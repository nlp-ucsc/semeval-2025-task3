Emperor Go-Daigo (後醍醐天皇) was the reigning emperor during the Japanese Genkyō period[2]. The Genkyō era, also known as Genkō, lasted from February 1321 to December 1324[2].

Some key events during Emperor Go-Daigo's reign in the Genkyō era include:

1. The death of Saionji Kinakira, Minister of the Right (udaijin), in 1321[2].
2. Former Emperor Go-Uda ordering the construction of a small chapel at Daikaku-ji in 1321[2].
3. Emperor Go-Daigo visiting Daikaku-ji to see the new chapel in 1321[2].
4. The death of Hōjō Kanetoki, the military governor of Kyushu, in 1321[2].
5. Hōjō Norisada being named governor of Kyoto and Hōjō Hidetoki being appointed military governor of Kyūshū in 1321[2].
6. Emperor Go-Daigo visiting former Emperor Go-Uda at Daikaku-ji and being entertained by a musical concert in 1322[2].

It's worth noting that Emperor Go-Daigo played a significant role in Japanese history beyond the Genkyō period. He attempted to restore imperial power in what became known as the Kemmu Restoration (1333-1336 CE)[3]. Although initially unsuccessful and exiled, he later returned and briefly held power before being defeated by Ashikaga Takauji, which led to the establishment of the Ashikaga Shogunate[3].
