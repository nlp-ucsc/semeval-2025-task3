The Cappella De Sylva in Sant'Isidoro a Capo le Case was designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini in 1663[1][3][5]. This small chapel is located to the right of the sanctuary and was commissioned by Rodrigo Lopez da Sylva, a Portuguese aristocrat who was Bernini's friend[1][6].

Some key details about the Cappella De Sylva:

1. It was one of Bernini's lesser-known chapel designs[5].

2. While Bernini created the overall design, he was not directly involved in its execution. Some of the reliefs may have been made by his son Pietro[2].

3. The chapel was completed in the 18th century, after Bernini's initial design work[2].

4. Bernini also designed a funerary monument for his own son, Paolo Valentino Bernini, within this chapel[3][5].

5. During a restoration in 2002, bronze tops that had been added to cover bare-breasted Virtue figures on the left wall were removed, restoring Bernini's original design[6].

The Cappella De Sylva is considered one of the masterpieces within Sant'Isidoro a Capo le Case, alongside frescoes and paintings by other notable artists like Carlo Maratta[6]. Its design by Bernini adds significant artistic and historical value to this Roman church.
