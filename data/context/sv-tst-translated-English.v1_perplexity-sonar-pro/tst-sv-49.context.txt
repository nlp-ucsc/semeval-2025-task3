The Battle of Long Island, also known as the Battle of Brooklyn or the Battle of Brooklyn Heights, resulted in a decisive British victory[1][3][5][6]. This battle took place on August 27, 1776, and was the first major engagement after the United States declared its independence on July 4, 1776[1][3].

Key points about the British victory:

1. Outcome: The battle ended with a clear British triumph, allowing them to gain control of New York City[1][3].

2. Casualties: The British suffered relatively light losses, with approximately 63 killed and 314 wounded. In contrast, American casualties were much higher, with an estimated 300 killed, 650 wounded, and about 1,100 captured or missing[1].

3. Strategic importance: This victory was part of the British campaign to seize control of New York and isolate New England from the rest of the colonies[3].

4. Military advantage: The British, commanded by Lt. Gen. William Howe, had a larger and more experienced force of about 22,000 soldiers, compared to the American force of 19,000 under Gen. George Washington[1][6].

5. Tactical success: The British outmaneuvered the Americans by using an undefended pass (Jamaica Pass) to attack from the rear, surprising and overwhelming the Continental Army[4][5].

Despite the clear British victory, it's worth noting that George Washington managed to save a significant portion of his army through a skillful nighttime evacuation across the East River to Manhattan on August 29-30[1][3][7]. This retreat, while not changing the outcome of the battle itself, helped preserve the Continental Army for future engagements and demonstrated Washington's leadership in the face of adversity.
