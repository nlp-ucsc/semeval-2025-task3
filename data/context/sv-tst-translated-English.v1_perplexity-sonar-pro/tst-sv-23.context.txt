Sophie NÃ©lisse was born in Windsor, Ontario, Canada on March 27, 2000[1][4]. She moved from Windsor to Montreal, Quebec with her family when she was four years old[1][2][3][4][6]. So Sophie did not move to Canada, as she was already born there, but she did move within Canada from one province to another at a young age.
