On February 11, 2021, Google honored María Grever, the renowned Mexican singer and composer, with a Google Doodle on their homepage[1][2][3]. This special Doodle celebrated Grever's significant contributions to music and her status as one of Mexico's greatest composers.

The Google Doodle featured an artistic representation of María Grever, replacing the standard Google logo on the search engine's homepage[2]. This temporary alteration of the logo was designed to commemorate Grever's achievements and draw attention to her legacy.

The specific date of February 11 was chosen because it marked the anniversary of Grever recording her hit song "Ti-Pi-Tin" in 1938[2][3]. This waltz, which is about serenading loved ones, became one of Grever's most popular compositions and contributed significantly to her international success.

The Doodle served multiple purposes:

1. Recognition: It highlighted Grever's status as one of Mexico's most esteemed composers and her role as the first female Mexican composer to achieve international acclaim[1].

2. Musical legacy: The Doodle emphasized Grever's prolific career, during which she produced hundreds of songs that were later covered by world-famous artists like Placido Domingo, Aretha Franklin, and Frank Sinatra[3].

3. Cultural significance: It brought attention to Grever's efforts to introduce Mexican music to American audiences, showcasing the rich cultural heritage of Mexican music[1][2].

4. Historical context: The Doodle provided an opportunity for users to learn about Grever's life, from her early musical talents to her work as a film composer for major studios like Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox[1][2].

By featuring María Grever in a Google Doodle, the company not only paid tribute to her artistic achievements but also helped introduce her story and music to a global audience, ensuring that her contributions to music continue to be recognized and appreciated worldwide.
