French troops occupied the Albanian region of Korça in October 1916[1]. Specifically:

The French military units of the East Army invaded Korça in October 1916 as part of their advance into Albania[1]. This occupation occurred in the context of World War I, as the Entente powers (including France) were trying to secure strategic positions in the Balkans against the Central Powers.

After initially handing over administration to Greek allies, the French command entered into negotiations with Albanian nationalist leaders. These negotiations resulted in the establishment of the Autonomous Republic of Korça on December 10, 1916[1][4]. This entity was created under French military protection but with a degree of Albanian self-governance.

However, the autonomous status was short-lived. On February 16, 1918, the French general Salle abolished the protocol that had established the Autonomous Republic of Korça[1]. The region was then placed under direct French military administration, which continued until 1920[6].

So in summary:
- French troops initially occupied Korça in October 1916
- They oversaw the creation of an autonomous Albanian administration in December 1916
- Direct French military rule was imposed in February 1918
- French occupation lasted until 1920 when Korça was fully integrated into independent Albania
