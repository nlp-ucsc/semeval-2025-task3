Folorunsho Alakija's fashion brand initially started as "Supreme Stitches" in the 1980s[1][2]. This label quickly rose to prominence in Nigeria's fashion industry, setting trends and becoming a fearless force in the local fashion scene[7].

As the brand grew and evolved, it was later rebranded as "Rose of Sharon House of Fashion"[1][2][7]. This new name became a household brand in Nigeria, solidifying Alakija's position as a significant figure in the country's fashion industry[3].

The Rose of Sharon House of Fashion became part of The Rose of Sharon Group, which serves as a parent company for several of Alakija's business ventures, including her fashion house, oil company, and real estate investments[2][10].

Throughout her career in fashion, Alakija demonstrated her commitment to the industry by serving as the National President and lifelong Trustee of the Fashion Designers Association of Nigeria (FADAN)[1][7]. In this role, she actively promoted Nigerian culture through fashion and style, leaving an indelible mark on the country's fashion landscape.
