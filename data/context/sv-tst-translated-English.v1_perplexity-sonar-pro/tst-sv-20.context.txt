Liangshan, also known as Mount Liang or Liangshan Marsh, is one of the primary settings in the classic Chinese novel "Water Margin" (水滸傳)[1][2]. This novel, also known as "Outlaws of the Marsh" or "All Men Are Brothers," is attributed to Shi Nai'an and is considered one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature[2].

"Water Margin" is set in the Northern Song dynasty, around 1120 CE, and tells the story of 108 outlaws who gather at Mount Liang (Liangshan) to rebel against a corrupt government[2]. The novel describes how these 108 "Stars of Destiny" - former soldiers, civil servants, and others who have run afoul of the law - come together at Liangshan Marsh, forming a stronghold from which they conduct their operations[1][5].

The significance of Liangshan in the novel lies in its geographical features:

1. It was a remote and inaccessible area, making it an ideal hideout for outlaws[5].
2. The region was described as having natural defenses, including mountains and sprawling marshland[5].
3. According to the novel, it could only be accessed through six narrow passes, which made it easy to defend[5].

The novel portrays Liangshan as a formidable fortress, with the opera "Black Whirlwind Presents Two Victories" describing it as having "72 deep rivers garrisoned with hundreds of warships. In 36 feasting towers, there is enough food for a million soldiers and their mounts"[5].

In reality, modern-day Liangshan is a modest peak, less than 200 meters above sea level, overlooking Dongping Lake[5]. However, its legendary status as the base of operations for the novel's heroic outlaws has cemented its place in Chinese literary history.
