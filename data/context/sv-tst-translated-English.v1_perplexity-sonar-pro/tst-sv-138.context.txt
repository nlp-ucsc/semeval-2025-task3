HSC Csíkszereda plays their home matches at the Vákár Lajos Ice Hall[1][2]. This arena, located in Miercurea Ciuc, Romania, has a capacity of 4,000 spectators[1][2]. 

The ice hall was built in January 1971 and was later renamed in 1999 to honor Lajos Vákár, a club legend and founder of the hockey team[1]. This venue has been the home of HSC Csíkszereda for several decades and has witnessed many of the team's successes, including their numerous Romanian Hockey League titles and cup victories[1].

The Vákár Lajos Ice Hall is not just a sports venue but also a significant cultural landmark for the local community. It regularly hosts sellout crowds, with most matches filling the 4,000-seat capacity[4]. The arena plays a crucial role in fostering the strong bond between the team and its supporters, many of whom are ethnic Hungarians living in Romania[4].
