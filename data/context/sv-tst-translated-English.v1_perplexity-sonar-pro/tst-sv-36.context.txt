The Alpine orogeny, which formed the Alpide belt, is primarily caused by the collision and convergent movements of several tectonic plates. The main plates involved in this process are:

1. The African Plate: Moving northward, colliding with Eurasia[1][2].

2. The Arabian Plate: Also moving northward, colliding with Eurasia[1][2].

3. The Indian Plate: Moving northward, colliding with Eurasia[1][2].

4. The Eurasian Plate: The main northern plate involved in the collision[1][2].

5. The Anatolian Sub-Plate: A smaller plate involved in the northern part of the collision[1].

6. The Cimmerian Plate: A small plate that was involved in the early stages of the Alpine orogeny[1].

These plate movements and collisions have resulted in the formation of various mountain ranges across a vast area, stretching from the Atlantic coast of northern Africa to the Himalayas and beyond[4]. The process of collision began in the early Cretaceous period, but the major phases of mountain building started in the Paleocene to Eocene epochs and continue to the present day in some parts of the Alpide belt[1].

The collision between these plates led to the closure of the Tethys Ocean, which once separated the northern and southern landmasses[2][5]. As the oceanic crust of the Tethys was subducted beneath the Eurasian plate, it resulted in the formation of the Mediterranean Sea and the uplift of the various mountain ranges that make up the Alpide belt[9].

It's important to note that the specific interactions between these plates can vary along the length of the Alpide belt, resulting in different geological structures and mountain ranges. For example, the formation of the Alps involved the collision of the African and Eurasian plates[4], while the Himalayas resulted from the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates[7].
