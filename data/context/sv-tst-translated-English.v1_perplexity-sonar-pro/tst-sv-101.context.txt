HMY Britannia was in royal service for 43 years and 334 days[7]. It was commissioned on January 11, 1954, and decommissioned on December 11, 1997[3][5].

The Royal Yacht Britannia had a long and distinguished career serving the British monarchy:

- It was launched by Queen Elizabeth II on April 16, 1953, and officially commissioned into royal service on January 11, 1954[1][3].

- During its 43-year career, Britannia sailed over 1 million nautical miles around the globe, visiting more than 600 ports in 135 countries[1][7].

- The yacht served as a royal residence, diplomatic vessel, and symbol of British maritime heritage for over four decades.

- In June 1994, John Major's government announced that Britannia would be decommissioned, citing the high costs of refitting and maintaining the aging vessel[4][5].

- Britannia's final voyage was a farewell tour around the UK in October 1997, calling at six major ports including Glasgow[5].

- The official decommissioning ceremony took place on December 11, 1997, in Portsmouth Naval Base[5][7]. This emotional event was attended by Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, and 14 other senior members of the Royal Family[7].

- At 3:01 PM on the day of decommissioning, all clocks aboard Britannia were stopped, marking the exact moment when Queen Elizabeth II disembarked for the last time[5][6].

The decommissioning of HMY Britannia marked the end of a long tradition of British royal yachts dating back to 1660[2]. After retirement, Britannia was permanently berthed at Ocean Terminal in Leith, Edinburgh, where it now serves as a museum ship and popular tourist attraction[3][7].
