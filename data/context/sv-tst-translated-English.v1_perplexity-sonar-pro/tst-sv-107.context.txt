Quarten is primarily located on the southern shore of Lake Walensee (also known as Lake Walen) in Switzerland[1]. The municipality stretches for about 8 kilometers along the southern shore of the lake[1]. 

However, it's important to note that Quarten's territory is not confined solely to the southern shore. The municipality also includes a detached section on the northern shore of Lake Walensee[1]. This northern section extends for about 4 kilometers along the lake shore and stretches about 2 kilometers up the slopes of the Leistchamm mountain[1].

The main settlements of Quarten along the southern shore include:

- Murg
- Unterterzen 
- Mols

These lakeside villages are overlooked by the settlements of Quarten and Oberterzen, which are situated at a slightly higher altitude[1].

On the northern shore, the municipality of Quarten includes the hamlet of Quinten. This unique settlement is only accessible by boat or on foot, as there are no roads leading to it[1][3].

So while Quarten is predominantly situated on the southern side of Lake Walensee, it has a presence on both shores of the lake, contributing to its diverse landscape and unique characteristics.
