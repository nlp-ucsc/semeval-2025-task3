The name "Chaos" for the Kuiper Belt object 19521 Chaos refers to the primordial state of existence in Greek mythology[1][3]. Specifically:

1. In Greek mythology, Chaos represents the primeval void or state of existence from which the first gods emerged[1][5].

2. This name was chosen to reflect the object's location in the distant, primordial region of the solar system known as the Kuiper Belt[1][3].

19521 Chaos is a cubewano, which means it is a classical Kuiper Belt object that orbits beyond Neptune and is not controlled by an orbital resonance with Neptune[2]. Some key facts about this object include:

- It was discovered in 1998 by the Deep Ecliptic Survey using Kitt Peak's 4-meter telescope[1][3].

- It has an estimated diameter of about 560-600 km, making it a relatively large Kuiper Belt object[1][3].

- Its orbit takes approximately 309-312 years to complete, with an average distance from the Sun of about 45.8 AU[5].

- Observations suggest it may be a compact or contact binary, rather than a single spherical body[5].

The name "Chaos" for this object aligns with the tradition of naming celestial bodies after mythological figures or concepts, in this case drawing from Greek mythology to evoke the ancient, mysterious nature of objects in the outer solar system.
