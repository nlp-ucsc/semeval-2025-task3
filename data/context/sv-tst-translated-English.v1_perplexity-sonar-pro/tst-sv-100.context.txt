Geoffroi de Villehardouin participated in the Fourth Crusade (1201-1204)[1][2]. He was a French knight, chronicler, and one of the leaders of this crusade[1]. Villehardouin played a significant role throughout the Fourth Crusade:

1. He joined the crusade in 1199 during a tournament held by Count Thibaud III of Champagne[2].

2. He was appointed as one of the ambassadors to Venice to procure ships for the voyage[2].

3. Villehardouin helped elect Boniface of Montferrat as the new leader of the Crusade when Thibaud died[2].

4. He served as an ambassador to Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelus during the crusade[2].

5. After the conquest of Constantinople in 1204, Villehardouin served as a military leader[2].

6. He led the retreat from the Battle of Adrianople in 1205 when Baldwin I was captured by Bulgarian forces[2].

7. As a reward for his services, Boniface of Montferrat gave Villehardouin the city of Messinopolis in Thrace[2].

8. After the crusade, Villehardouin was named Marshal of the Latin Empire[2].

Villehardouin's participation in the Fourth Crusade is well-documented because he wrote a firsthand account of the events titled "De la ConquÃªte de Constantinople" (On the Conquest of Constantinople), which is considered one of the earliest works of French prose and an important historical source for the Fourth Crusade[1][2][5].
