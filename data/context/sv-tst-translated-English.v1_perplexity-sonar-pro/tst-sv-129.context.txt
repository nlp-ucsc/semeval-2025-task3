I apologize, but I don't have accurate information about the specific population of Chengjiang in 2010 based on the provided search results. The search results do not contain direct data about Chengjiang's population in 2010.

The closest information we have is from search result [9], which mentions Chengjiang but provides only its area (804 km2) and a population figure of 146,293. However, this data point is not explicitly tied to the year 2010, so we cannot confidently state that this was the population in 2010.

To get an accurate population figure for Chengjiang in 2010, we would need to consult more specific sources, such as local government records or detailed census data for that particular area. The 2010 Chinese census data provided in the search results focuses mainly on larger administrative divisions and doesn't include information about smaller localities like Chengjiang.

If you need the exact population of Chengjiang in 2010, I recommend looking for more specialized sources or contacting local authorities in Chengjiang for accurate historical population data.
