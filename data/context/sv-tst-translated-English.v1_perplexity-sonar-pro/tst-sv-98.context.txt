The last film that Frances Farmer appeared in was "Son of Fury: The Story of Benjamin Blake" in 1942[2][4]. This was a period swashbuckler film starring Tyrone Power, in which Farmer portrayed the character Isabel Blake[2]. After this film, Farmer's Hollywood career essentially ended, though she did have an uncredited appearance in the 1943 film "I Escaped from the Gestapo" in a montage sequence[1][2].

Following "Son of Fury," Farmer's personal struggles and mental health issues led to her departure from the film industry. She later had some television appearances in the late 1950s, including roles in shows like "Studio One" and "Playhouse 90," but "Son of Fury" marked the end of her major feature film career[1][2].
