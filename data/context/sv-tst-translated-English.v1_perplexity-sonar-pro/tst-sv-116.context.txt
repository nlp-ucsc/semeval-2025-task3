I apologize, but I don't have enough specific information in the provided search results to determine which canton the French commune of Joannas is located in. The search results contain only limited details about Joannas:

Joannas is a commune in the Ardèche department in southern-central France[6][7]. It is located approximately 33 kilometers from Privas, which is the capital of the Ardèche department[7]. 

While this gives us some general location information, it does not specify the exact canton. Cantons are subdivisions of French departments, but the canton for Joannas is not mentioned in the available search results.

To provide a complete answer, more specific local administrative information about Joannas would be needed. If you require the precise canton, I recommend consulting official French government resources or detailed maps of the Ardèche department's administrative divisions.
