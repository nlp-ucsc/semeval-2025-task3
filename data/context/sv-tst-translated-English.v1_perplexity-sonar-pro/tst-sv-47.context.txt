Pferdingsleben is located at an elevation of 290 meters (951 feet) above sea level[4]. This small municipality is situated in the district of Gotha in the German state of Thuringia[1]. 

To provide some additional context:

Pferdingsleben is part of the Nesseaue administrative community (Verwaltungsgemeinschaft) within Gotha district[3]. The town has a relatively small population, with 384 residents recorded in the 2022 census[7]. 

The surrounding Gotha district has varied topography:

- The northern part of the district, where Pferdingsleben is located, is part of the Thuringian Basin with elevations around 200 meters (656 feet)[3].
- To the south, the land rises to about 900 meters (2,953 feet) in the Thuringian Forest[3].
- The highest point in the district is Gro√üer Inselsberg at 916.5 meters (3,007 feet), located on the southern border[3].

So at 290 meters, Pferdingsleben sits at a moderate elevation compared to the range found across the district, higher than the basin to the north but much lower than the forested hills to the south.
