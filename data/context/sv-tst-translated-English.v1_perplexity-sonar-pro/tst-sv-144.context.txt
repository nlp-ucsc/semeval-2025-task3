Fredrikstad FK finished in 2nd place in the Norwegian Tippeligaen (now known as Eliteserien) in the 2008 season[1][2][8]. This was a strong performance for the club, as they ended up just behind the champions Stab√¶k. 

Some key details about Fredrikstad's 2008 season:

1. They accumulated 48 points over 26 matches[1][8].

2. Their record included 14 wins, 6 draws, and 6 losses[1].

3. Fredrikstad scored 38 goals and conceded 28, giving them a goal difference of +10[1].

4. This second-place finish qualified Fredrikstad for the Europa League third qualifying round[1].

5. It was a significant improvement from their previous seasons, marking one of their best performances in recent years[3][4].

This second-place finish in 2008 was particularly noteworthy for Fredrikstad FK, as it came during their resurgence after spending many years in lower divisions. The club had returned to the top flight in 2004 after 18 years outside of it, making their 2008 performance even more impressive[4].
