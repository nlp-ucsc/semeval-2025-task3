The current bassist of In Flames is Liam Wilson[1][3][5]. He joined the band in 2023, replacing previous bassist Bryce Paul Newman who decided to step away from the group[1][3].

Liam Wilson is best known for his work with The Dillinger Escape Plan, where he played bass from 2000 to 2017[2]. He's also been involved in other projects like John Frum and Azusa[3]. Wilson made his live debut with In Flames on June 7, 2023, at the Release Athens 2023 festival in Greece[1].

It's worth noting that In Flames has had several bassists throughout their history:

1. Johan Larsson (1990-1997)
2. Peter Iwers (1997-2016)
3. Bryce Paul Newman (2018-2023)
4. Liam Wilson (2023-present)

The band's vocalist, Anders Fridén, has praised the current lineup, including Wilson, stating that they "never sounded better"[10]. Wilson's addition to In Flames appears to be a good fit, with Fridén describing him as "awesome" and mentioning that he "fits in the band really well"[10].
