Cyrtophora moluccensis was first described by Carl Ludwig Doleschall in 1857[3]. Doleschall was an Austrian arachnologist and entomologist who worked extensively in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia (then known as the Dutch East Indies). He made significant contributions to the taxonomy of spiders and insects in that region during the mid-19th century.

The species name "moluccensis" refers to the Moluccas (also known as the Maluku Islands), an archipelago in eastern Indonesia where the spider was likely first discovered or collected. This naming convention was common in taxonomic descriptions of that era, often indicating the geographic origin of newly described species.

Cyrtophora moluccensis is a tent-web spider belonging to the orb-weaver family Araneidae. It is known by several common names, including the tent spider and dome-web spider[3]. The species has a wide distribution across the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific, including India, Japan, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Australia, Fiji, and Tonga[3].

Since its original description by Doleschall, C. moluccensis has been the subject of numerous studies focusing on its unique web structure, social behavior, and ecological role in various habitats[1][3][5]. The species is particularly notable for its ability to form large colonies and construct elaborate, tent-like web structures that can house multiple individuals[5].
