Zonitoides snails were described by Lehmann in 1862[2][5][9]. Lehmann established the genus Zonitoides in that year, which includes small air-breathing land snails in the family Gastrodontidae[1][2]. 

Some key points about Zonitoides:

- It is a genus of terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusks[2][5].
- The type species is Helix nitidus MÃ¼ller, 1774[5].
- Zonitoides has a wide distribution, including North America, Europe, eastern and northern Asia, and parts of Australia[7].
- There are currently 17 extant and accepted species in the genus, most of which were described over a century ago[4].
- The genus is part of the family Gastrodontidae, which was established by Tryon in 1866[2].

Lehmann's 1862 description of Zonitoides was an important contribution to malacology, establishing this genus of small land snails that has since been found to have a widespread distribution across multiple continents. His work laid the foundation for further taxonomic and ecological research on these gastropods over the subsequent 150+ years.
