I apologize, but I do not have enough information to determine how much the population of Malville, France increased between 1962 and 2021. The search results do not provide historical population data for Malville covering that specific time period. The only relevant information is from search result [3], which mentions some 2021 data for Malville but does not provide any historical comparison to 1962. Without reliable population figures for both years, I cannot calculate the population change over that time span. More specific historical census data for Malville would be needed to accurately answer this question.
