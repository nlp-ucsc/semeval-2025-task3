It's worth noting that the German version of the game was heavily censored to receive a USK-18 rating (the German equivalent of Mature 17+) and to avoid being indexed or banned. In this version, some of the more graphic violence was toned down, such as enemies disappearing instead of bursting into bloody pieces when killed by explosions or point-blank shotgun blasts[1].

The Mature 17+ rating is consistent across the F.E.A.R. franchise, with subsequent titles like F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin[10] and F.E.A.R. 3[2] also receiving the same age rating for similar content.
