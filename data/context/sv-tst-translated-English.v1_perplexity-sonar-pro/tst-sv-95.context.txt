The highest point on the island of La Gomera is Alto de Garajonay, with an elevation of 1,487 meters (4,879 feet) above sea level[1][3][4]. 

Alto de Garajonay is located in the central region of La Gomera, within Garajonay National Park[3][5]. This mountain has great historical and cultural significance for the island:

- It was formerly used for rituals and sacrifices by the indigenous inhabitants[3].
- It served as a protective refuge from animals and other hazards[3].
- It was nicknamed "El Bailadero" as it was believed to be a meeting place for witches[3].

The summit offers panoramic views of La Gomera and, on clear days, visitors can see neighboring Canary Islands like Tenerife, La Palma, El Hierro, and sometimes even Gran Canaria[3][7]. 

The mountain and surrounding national park are popular hiking destinations. There are numerous trails leading to the summit, allowing visitors to experience the unique laurel forest ecosystem of the park[5][8]. The circular Gran Ruta 18 trail, for example, goes from El Cedro to the Alto de Garajonay summit[8].

Alto de Garajonay is not only a geographical landmark but also features in local folklore. The mountain's name comes from a Guanche legend about the tragic love story of Gara and Jonay[5], adding cultural richness to its natural significance.
