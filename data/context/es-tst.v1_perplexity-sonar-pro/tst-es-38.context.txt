International Klein Blue (IKB) is a deep, vibrant shade of blue developed and patented by French artist Yves Klein in 1960[1][5]. The color's name originates from its creator, Yves Klein, and its international recognition in the art world.

The development of IKB began in the 1950s when Klein became obsessed with creating the purest and most vibrant blue possible[4]. After years of experimentation, Klein collaborated with Edouard Adam, a Parisian art paint supplier, to develop this unique blue[1][4]. The key to IKB's distinctive appearance lies not in the pigment itself, but in the synthetic resin binder used to suspend the color[1][5].

Key aspects of International Klein Blue:

1. Composition: IKB uses ultramarine blue pigment combined with a specific polyvinyl acetate binder developed by the French pharmaceutical company Rhône-Poulenc[1].

2. Visual properties: The color is characterized by its intense, pure blue hue without any traces of green, purple, or gray[5]. It maintains the pigment's original intensity and powdery texture[1].

3. Registration: Klein officially registered IKB on May 19, 1960, at the Institut national de la propriété industrielle in France under Soleau envelope number 63471[1][5].

4. Significance in art: IKB became Klein's signature color and was central to his artistic practice. He used it in various works, including monochromatic canvases, sculptures, and performance art pieces[1][3].

5. Symbolic meaning: For Klein, IKB represented the immaterial and spiritual aspects of art. He saw it as a color that went beyond traditional dimensions, describing it as "the invisible becoming visible"[3].

The creation and patenting of IKB were revolutionary acts in the art world, blurring the lines between art, science, and intellectual property. Klein's work with this distinctive blue color significantly influenced contemporary art and continues to be recognized as a powerful branding element associated with the artist[3].
