The three main protagonists in the American film "Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!" are:

1. Varla, played by Tura Satana
2. Rosie, played by Haji
3. Billie, played by Lori Williams[1][2][4]

Varla is the leader of the trio, portrayed as a violent and aggressive character. Rosie is secretly in love with Varla, while Billie is described as the most independent and cheerful of the three[2]. These three go-go dancers embark on a violent spree of kidnapping and murder in the California desert[1].

The film, directed by Russ Meyer and released in 1965, has become a cult classic known for its provocative gender roles, violence, and memorable dialogue[1]. Tura Satana's performance as Varla is particularly noted for its powerful and commanding presence, with her character described as a "sexual beast, evil, violent, and expeditious"[4].
