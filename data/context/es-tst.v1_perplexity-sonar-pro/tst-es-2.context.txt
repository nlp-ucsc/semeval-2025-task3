Fortescue, Missouri is a small village with a population of 20 inhabitants as of 2023. However, there are some discrepancies in the population figures across different sources and years:

1. The 2020 Census recorded a population of 21 people[5][7].

2. In 2022, one source reported a population of 41 people[6].

3. Historical data shows that Fortescue's population has been declining over the years:
   - In 2010, the population was 32[5][7].
   - In 2000, the population was 51[5][7].

4. The town has experienced significant population decline since its peak in the early 20th century. In 1940, Fortescue had 175 inhabitants[7].

It's important to note that for such a small community, even minor changes in the number of residents can result in significant percentage changes in population statistics. The most recent and likely most accurate figure is the 2023 population estimate of 20 inhabitants[3].
