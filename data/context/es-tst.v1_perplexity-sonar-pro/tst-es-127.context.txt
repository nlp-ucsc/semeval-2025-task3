Gordon Strachan's last role as a manager was with the Scotland national team[10]. He left this position in October 2017 after failing to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia[10]. 

Prior to managing Scotland, Strachan had a notable managerial career at the club level. His last club management position was with Middlesbrough in the English Championship, which he left in 2010[1][9]. After Middlesbrough, he took a break from management before taking on the Scotland national team role in 2013.

It's worth noting that while Strachan is no longer actively managing a team, he is currently serving as the Technical Director at Dundee FC[1][3]. This role, which he took on after his time with the Scotland national team, is more of an advisory and overseeing position rather than direct team management.
