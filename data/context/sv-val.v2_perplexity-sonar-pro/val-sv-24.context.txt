Based on the available information, I cannot provide an exact figure for the population density (inhabitants per square kilometer) of General Pinedo, Argentina. However, I can offer some relevant details about the town's population:

General Pinedo is located in the Doce de Octubre Department of Chaco Province, Argentina. According to the search results, the population of General Pinedo has been reported as follows:

1. 13,042 inhabitants as of the 2010 census[1]
2. Approximately 16,000 inhabitants as per the 2001 census[7]
3. 15,741 inhabitants according to a more recent but undated source[4]

Without specific information about the land area of General Pinedo, it's not possible to calculate an accurate population density. However, we can note that the population has grown over time, from 13,042 in 2010 to an estimated 15,741 in a more recent count.

For context, Argentina as a whole has a population density of 17 people per square kilometer as of 2022[6]. However, this national average is unlikely to be representative of General Pinedo, as population densities can vary significantly between urban and rural areas.

General Pinedo is described as a town in the south of Chaco Province[7], suggesting it may have a higher population density than the provincial average, but likely lower than major urban centers like Buenos Aires.

To get an accurate population density for General Pinedo, we would need both the most current population figure and the precise land area of the town.
