Chris Claremont wrote Uncanny X-Men comics for a total of 16 years during his initial, landmark run from 1975 to 1991[1][3]. This 16-year tenure is widely regarded as one of the most influential and successful runs in comic book history[4].

During this period, Claremont transformed the X-Men from a struggling title on the brink of cancellation into Marvel's best-selling and most popular series[1]. His run began with issue #94 in 1975 and continued through issue #279 in 1991[3]. 

Some key aspects of Claremont's 16-year run include:

1. Character Development: He created or co-created numerous iconic X-Men characters, including Rogue, Psylocke, Kitty Pryde, and Gambit[1].

2. Storytelling: Claremont introduced complex, long-running storylines and subplots, elevating the narrative style of superhero comics[2].

3. Artistic Collaborations: He worked with renowned artists like John Byrne, Dave Cockrum, and Jim Lee, producing some of the most memorable X-Men stories[4].

4. Landmark Stories: His run included classic storylines such as "The Dark Phoenix Saga" and "Days of Future Past"[1][4].

5. Female Characters: Claremont was known for developing strong, complex female characters, which was relatively uncommon in superhero comics at the time[4].

After his initial departure in 1991, Claremont returned to write Uncanny X-Men for shorter periods in 2000-2001 and 2004-2006, adding to his total time on the title[3]. However, his original 16-year run remains his most celebrated and influential contribution to the X-Men franchise and comic book history.
