Johnny Cash had a total of seven children - five biological children and two stepchildren. Here's a breakdown of his children:

Biological children:
1. Rosanne Cash (born 1955)
2. Kathy Cash (born 1956)
3. Cindy Cash (born 1958)
4. Tara Cash (born 1961)
5. John Carter Cash (born 1970)

The first four daughters - Rosanne, Kathy, Cindy, and Tara - were from Johnny Cash's first marriage to Vivian Liberto, which lasted from 1954 to 1966[2][5]. 

John Carter Cash, born in 1970, was Johnny's only son and his only child with his second wife, June Carter Cash[3][6].

Stepchildren:
6. Carlene Carter (born 1955)
7. Rosie Nix Adams (1958-2003)

When Johnny Cash married June Carter in 1968, he became stepfather to her two daughters from previous marriages - Carlene Carter and Rosie Nix Adams[3][6][8].

Several of Johnny Cash's children followed in his musical footsteps. Rosanne Cash, in particular, has had a successful career as a singer-songwriter[2]. John Carter Cash also became involved in the music industry as an artist and producer[6].

Tragically, Johnny's stepdaughter Rosie Nix Adams passed away in October 2003, just a month after Johnny Cash's own death[8].
