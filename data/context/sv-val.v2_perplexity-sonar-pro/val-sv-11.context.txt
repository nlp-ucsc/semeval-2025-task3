According to historical records, Hamilton Academical FC played their first match on October 17, 1874 against Gilbertfield[3]. The match ended in a 0-2 loss for Hamilton Academical[3].

This information comes from recent research conducted in April 2016 by Stewart Mathers, which corrected the previously held belief that the club's first match was on December 12, 1874 against Hamilton FC's second XI (which Hamilton Academical reportedly lost 1-2)[7].

So to summarize:
