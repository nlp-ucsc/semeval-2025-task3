Dave Franco has two older brothers:

1. James Franco - The eldest Franco brother, born in 1978. James is a well-known actor, director, and artist who rose to fame with roles in films like "Spider-Man," "127 Hours," and "The Disaster Artist"[1][2].

2. Tom Franco - The middle Franco brother, born in 1980. Tom is primarily focused on visual arts and runs the Firehouse Art Collective. He has also had small acting roles, including a non-speaking part in "The Disaster Artist"[1].

All three Franco brothers were born and raised in Palo Alto, California, to parents Betsy Franco, a writer, and Douglas Eugene Franco, who ran a Silicon Valley business[1][2]. The brothers grew up in what Dave described as a "weird and artsy" household, with both parents having studied painting in college[1].

The Franco brothers have occasionally collaborated professionally. Most notably, James directed Dave in "The Disaster Artist" (2017), with Tom also making a brief appearance in the film[1]. Despite their family connection, Dave has made efforts to establish his own career independently, particularly in the early stages of his acting journey[1].
