Bruce Sterling's debut novel, "Involution Ocean" (1977), is set on a world called Nullaqua[5][8][9]. 

Nullaqua is described as a dry planet where the entire atmosphere is contained within a single, miles-deep crater[7]. The novel's story takes place on this world, focusing on a ship that sails on an ocean of dust at the bottom of this massive crater, hunting creatures called dustwhales[7].

This unique setting serves as a science-fictional reimagining of Herman Melville's "Moby-Dick", with Sterling adapting the concept of whaling to this alien environment[7]. The dustwhales are hunted in a manner similar to how whales are hunted in Earth's oceans, creating an intriguing parallel between the familiar and the fantastical.

Sterling's choice of such an unusual setting for his debut novel showcases his imaginative approach to science fiction, which would become a hallmark of his later works in the cyberpunk subgenre and beyond.
