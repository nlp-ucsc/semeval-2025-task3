Lugdunum, the Roman city that later became modern-day Lyon in France, was founded in 43 BC[1][2]. The city was established by Lucius Munatius Plancus, who was the governor of Gaul at the time[1][2]. 

This foundation occurred during a significant period in Roman history - it was nine years after Julius Caesar had conquered Gaul and just one year before Caesar's assassination in Rome[2]. The Roman Senate had ordered Munatius Plancus to found a city for a group of Roman refugees who had been expelled from Vienne (a town about 30 km south) by the Allobroges[1].

The original name of the Roman settlement was Colonia Copia Felix Munatia[1]. However, by the end of the 1st century AD, it was increasingly referred to as Lugdunum (and occasionally Lugudunum)[1]. The name Lugdunum is believed to be a Latinization of the Gaulish *Lugudunon*, meaning "Fortress of (the god) Lugus" or "Fortress of the champion"[1].

It's worth noting that while 43 BC marks the official Roman foundation, archaeological evidence suggests that the site had been inhabited long before. There was a pre-existing Gallic settlement in the area with continuous occupation from the 4th century BC[1]. The Roman city was established on the Fourvière heights above the Saône river, where this earlier settlement had been located[1].
