The county's southern border is formed by the Ohio River, while its western border is formed by the Wabash River, which is a tributary of the Ohio[1]. These rivers likely account for much of the water area within the county. Additionally, the county contains other water bodies such as the Black River, which flows southwestward through the county's upper portion before discharging into the Wabash River north of New Harmony[1].

It's worth noting that Posey County's location at the confluence of major rivers contributes to its significance as a port area. The Ports of Indiana-Mount Vernon, located on the Ohio River in Posey County, is the seventh-largest inland port complex in the nation, handling more than 4 million trip tons of cargo annually[1].
