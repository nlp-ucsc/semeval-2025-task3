The Red Bull Arena in Austria was previously known by several different names:

1. Österreichring: This was the original name of the circuit when it was first built in 1969[4][10]. It was a 5.942 km long track known for its fast corners and elevation changes[10].

2. A1-Ring: In 1997, after significant renovations and shortening of the track, it was renamed to A1-Ring[4][10]. This name was used until 2003.

3. EM-Stadion Wals-Siezenheim: During the UEFA Euro 2008 football championship, the stadium was temporarily called this[7].

4. Bullen-Arena: This was another temporary name used for the stadium[7].

The track underwent several changes over the years, including being shortened and modified. In 2004, Red Bull bought the circuit, and after extensive renovations, it was reopened in 2011 under its current name, Red Bull Ring[4][10].

It's worth noting that there are actually two different Red Bull Arenas being discussed in the search results - one is the racing circuit in Spielberg, Austria (now called Red Bull Ring), and the other is a football stadium in Wals-Siezenheim, near Salzburg, Austria. Both have gone through name changes, but the racing circuit is the one that was formerly known as Österreichring and A1-Ring.
