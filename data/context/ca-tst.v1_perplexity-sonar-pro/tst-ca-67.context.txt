Bee Train Production, commonly referred to simply as Bee Train, was founded by Kōichi Mashimo in 1997[1][3]. 

Specifically:

- The studio was founded on June 5, 1997[3][8].
- Kōichi Mashimo was previously a director at Tatsunoko Productions and the founder of Mashimo Jimusho, a small freelance staff working for other studios[3].
- Mashimo's goal in founding Bee Train was to create a "hospital for animators" - an animation studio focused on nurturing young talents and artistic quality rather than corporate strategies and profit[3].
- This studio-as-hospital approach was reportedly inspired by Mashimo's prolonged stay in an intensive care unit after a severe skiing accident[3].

Initially, Bee Train was a subsidiary of Production I.G along with Xebec, but it became independent in February 2006[3]. The studio gained prominence through works like Noir, .hack//Sign, and Madlax, which helped establish its reputation for series featuring strong female leads[1][3].
