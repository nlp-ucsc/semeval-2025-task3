The Fratellis is a Scottish rock band from Glasgow consisting of three core members:

1. Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler) - lead vocals, guitar, piano, and keyboards[1][2][3]

2. Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace) - bass guitar and backing vocals[1][2][3]

3. Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory) - drums, backing vocals, and banjo[1][2][3]

The band also has a touring member:

- Will Foster - keyboards and piano (2008–present), guitar (2008–2009)[3]

The Fratellis formed in 2005 and took their name from the villains in the film "The Goonies"[1]. Interestingly, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is actually Fratelli[1]. The band members are not actually related, despite using the same stage surname[2].
