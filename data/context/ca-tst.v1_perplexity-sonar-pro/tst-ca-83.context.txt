John Travolta plays the role of Brigadier General Quintard in the 1998 American war film "The Thin Red Line"[1][6]. His appearance in the film is brief, amounting to what is essentially a cameo role:

1. Travolta appears early in the film as a high-ranking officer[6].

2. His character, Brig. Gen. Quintard, is described as verbose and theatrical, speaking very loudly in a film that generally prefers softer, more soulful tones[6].

3. Travolta's screen time is extremely limited, estimated to be only about three minutes long[2].

4. Despite his brief appearance, Travolta's name was prominently featured in the marketing of the movie[1].

5. His character is notable for having an "irritatingly distracting mustache"[6].

6. After his early scene, Travolta's character disappears and does not return for the rest of the film[6].

It's worth noting that "The Thin Red Line" had an exceptionally star-studded cast, with many well-known actors appearing in small roles or cameos. This was largely due to director Terrence Malick's reputation and the excitement surrounding his return to filmmaking after a 20-year absence[8]. Travolta's brief appearance is an example of how even major stars were willing to take on minor roles just to be part of this prestigious project.
