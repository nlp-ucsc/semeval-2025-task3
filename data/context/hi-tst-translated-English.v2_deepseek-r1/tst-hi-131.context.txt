The final phase of classical Japanese history is known as the **Heian period**. The Heian period lasted from 794 to 1185 CE. This era is famous for its refined culture, including literature (such as "The Tale of Genji"), art, and Buddhism. However, it also saw the rise of the samurai class and significant political changes that eventually led to the end of the classical period and the start of the medieval period with the establishment of the Kamakura shogunate in 1185.
