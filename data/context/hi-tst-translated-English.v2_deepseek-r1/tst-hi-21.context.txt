I'm not sure about the exact melting point of aluminum nitrate. I know that aluminum nitrate is a salt and typically, nitrates have high melting points because of their ionic nature. However, I can't provide an exact figure without checking a reliable source. It's best to consult a chemistry reference or a trusted database for accurate information on this property.
