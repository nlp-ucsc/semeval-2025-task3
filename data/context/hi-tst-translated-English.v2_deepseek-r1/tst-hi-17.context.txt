When there is no ICAO code available for an airport, a special code is used, often referred to as a **"Z" code". For example, the code **"Z99"** might be used as a placeholder. However, it's important to note that the specific code can vary depending on the context or the system being used. In some cases, local or alternative codes may be assigned by aviation authorities or organizations. Always check the most current aviation documentation or databases for the most accurate information.
