The distance that a coastal plain can extend from the sea or river shore can vary widely depending on a number of geological and geographical factors. Here are some key points that determine the extent of a coastal plain:

1. **Geological History**: The formation of a coastal plain is often influenced by the erosion of older rock formations and the deposition of sediment over time. In tectonically stable areas, such as passive continental margins, coastal plains can extend for hundreds of kilometers inland. For example, the Atlantic Coastal Plain in North America stretches from the Atlantic Ocean to the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, covering a significant portion of the eastern United States.

2. **Sediment Supply**: The amount of sediment deposited in the coastal area plays a crucial role in the development and extent of the coastal plain. Rivers transporting large amounts of sediment can build up extensive coastal plains through delta formation and sediment accumulation.

3. **Sea Level Changes**: Fluctuations in sea levels, such as those that occur due to glaciation and deglaciation cycles, can influence the extent of the coastal plain. During times of low sea levels, such as during glacial periods, coastal plains may extend further seaward as the shoreline moves outward. Conversely, rising sea levels can inundate parts of the coastal plain, reducing its inland extent.

4. **Tectonic Activity**: Areas with active tectonic processes, such as subduction zones or mountain-building regions, may have narrower coastal plains due to the uplift of the land or the presence of rugged terrain that limits the inland expansion of the plain.

5. **Human Activities**: In some cases, human activities such as land reclamation and coastal engineering can alter the natural extent of a coastal plain. Reclaimed land can extend the plain further seaward, while dams and other structures can affect sediment supply and limit the natural expansion of the plain.

In summary, the distance a coastal plain can extend from the shore is highly variable and is shaped by a combination of geological processes, sediment availability, sea level changes, tectonic activity, and human interventions. While some coastal plains may extend only a few kilometers inland, others can span hundreds of kilometers, creating vast low-lying regions adjacent to the coast.
