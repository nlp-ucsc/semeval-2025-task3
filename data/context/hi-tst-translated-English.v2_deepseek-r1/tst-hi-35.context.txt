The Earth's coastline is approximately 620,000 kilometers (385,000 miles) long. This measurement includes the coastlines of all continents, as well as the edges of islands and other landmasses that border oceans and seas. However, it's important to note that the exact length can vary depending on the source and the methods used to measure it, as coastlines can be highly irregular and difficult to precisely quantify.
