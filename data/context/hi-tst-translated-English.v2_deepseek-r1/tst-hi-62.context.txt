Rosalind Franklin died on April 16, 1958, at the age of 37, due to complications from ovarian cancer. Her death was likely linked to her prolonged exposure to X-rays during her research, which was a common hazard for scientists at the time. Franklin's contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA were significant, and she is often underrecognized for her work alongside James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins.
