The First Crusade began in the year 1096. It was launched in response to a call by Pope Urban II at the Council of Clermont in November 1095, and the crusade itself started in the summer of 1096 with the departure of the crusader armies from Europe. The crusaders' primary goal was to reclaim the Holy Land, particularly Jerusalem, from Muslim rule. The First Crusade culminated in the capture of Jerusalem in July 1099.
