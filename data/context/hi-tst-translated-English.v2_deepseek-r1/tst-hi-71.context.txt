The concept of the relational database was defined by Edgar F. Codd. He introduced this model in a seminal paper titled "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks" published in 1970. Codd, a British computer scientist, worked at IBM Research and his work laid the foundation for the development of modern relational databases. His relational model organises data into tables, with defined relationships between them, and introduced concepts like primary and foreign keys, normalization, and SQL (Structured Query Language) for data manipulation.
