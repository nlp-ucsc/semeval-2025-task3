In North American tradition, particularly in Canada, Santa Claus has a special postal code to help children send their letters. The postal code is **H0H 0H0**. This unique code represents the letter "HO HO HO" in a postal format, symbolizing Santa's iconic laughter. 

Canada Post, the country's postal service, uses this code to process the many letters sent to Santa each year. They even have a program called "Operation Santa Claus" where volunteers respond to these letters, spreading holiday cheer to children across the country. 

So, if you're writing to Santa, don't forget to use **H0H 0H0** to ensure your letter reaches the North Pole via Canada!
