In Romanian folklore, vampires are often referred to as **"strigoi"** (singular: *strigoi*, plural: *strigoi* or *strigoii*). The term "strigoi" describes a type of undead creature that rises from the grave to haunt the living, typically at night. Similar to the concept of vampires in other cultures, strigoi are often associated with sucking the blood or life force from their victims. Romanians also sometimes use the word **"vampir"**, which is derived from the English or German term "vampire," but "strigoi" is the more traditional and culturally specific term.
