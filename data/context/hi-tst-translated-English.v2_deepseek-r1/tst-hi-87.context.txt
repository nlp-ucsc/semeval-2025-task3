In England, Holy Thursday is commonly known as **Maundy Thursday**. This name is derived from the Latin word "mandatum," which means "command." It refers to Jesus' commandment to his disciples to "love one another as I have loved you" during the Last Supper, as recorded in the Gospel of John (John 13:34). On Maundy Thursday, many churches hold special services to commemorate the institution of the Eucharist and the washing of the disciples' feet by Jesus.
