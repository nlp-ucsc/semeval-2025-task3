The largest music group in America can be determined by various factors such as sales, influence, or cultural impact. As of my last update in July 2024, one of the most prominent music groups in the U.S. is **Taylor Swift and The 1975, Bad Bunny, and others**. However, popularity can change over time, so the answer may vary based on current trends and metrics. For the most accurate and recent information, I recommend checking the latest Billboard charts or reputable music industry sources.
