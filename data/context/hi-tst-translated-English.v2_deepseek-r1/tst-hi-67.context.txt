The Protestant Reformation is famously associated with several key figures, but Martin Luther is often regarded as the catalyst for the movement. He sparked the Reformation when he published his Ninety-Five Theses in 1517, protesting against certain practices of the Catholic Church, such as the sale of indulgences. This act is seen as a pivotal moment in the history of Christianity, leading to the development of Protestantism. Other notable figures include John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli, who also played significant roles in shaping Protestant theology and practices. However, Martin Luther is typically the most prominent name associated with leading and inspiring the Protestant Reformation.
