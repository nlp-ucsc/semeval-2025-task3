The nationality law of the United Kingdom recognizes several categories of nationality, primarily defined under the British Nationality Act 1981 and subsequent amendments. The main categories include British Citizens, British Overseas Territories Citizens, British Overseas Citizens, British Nationals (Overseas), British Protected Persons, and British Subjects. Each category reflects different historical and legal relationships with the UK and its territories.
