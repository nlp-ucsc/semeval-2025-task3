I don't have access to real-time information or specific details about individuals unless it's widely known and publicly available. As of my last update in July 2024, the Chief Minister of West Bengal is Mamata Banerjee, who has been in office since 2011. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking a reliable news source or official government publications.
