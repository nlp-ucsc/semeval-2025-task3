Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is a rare neurological disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the peripheral nerves, leading to muscle weakness and, in some cases, paralysis. The severity of GBS can vary widely among individuals.

Regarding the need for ventilation, it is estimated that approximately **20-30% of people** with Guillain-Barré Syndrome will require mechanical ventilation due to severe weakness of the respiratory muscles. This is one of the most critical complications of the syndrome, as it can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.

The need for ventilation typically depends on the progression and severity of the illness. Some individuals may experience a rapid onset of symptoms that affect their ability to breathe, while others may have a more gradual decline in strength, allowing for earlier intervention.

It's important to note that with prompt medical attention, including the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasma exchange, many people with GBS can recover fully or nearly fully. However, the recovery process can vary in length and may require extensive rehabilitation.
