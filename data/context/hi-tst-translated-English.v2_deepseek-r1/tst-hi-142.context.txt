The national motto of Greece is "Ελευθερία ή Θάνατος" (Eleftheria i Thanatos), which translates to "Liberty or Death." This motto reflects the country's strong commitment to freedom and independence, especially evident during its struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century.
