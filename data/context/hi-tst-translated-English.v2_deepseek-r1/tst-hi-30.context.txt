The first day of the Gregorian calendar in 1424 would have been Monday, January 1, 1424. However, it's important to note that the Gregorian calendar was not adopted until much later; it was introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582. Therefore, in 1424, the Julian calendar was in use, and the actual start of the year might have been different depending on the region and the specific calendar system they followed.
