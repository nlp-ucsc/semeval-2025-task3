Besides a zoo, a garden that displays wild animals in artificial natural habitats can also be referred to as a **wildlife sanctuary**, **wildlife park**, or **safari park**. Each of these terms has slightly different connotations:

- **Wildlife Sanctuary**: Typically focuses on rescuing, rehabilitating, and protecting animals, often in more naturalistic environments.
- **Wildlife Park**: Emphasizes the display of animals in enclosed natural environments for public viewing and conservation.
- **Safari Park**: Allows animals to roam in large, open spaces that mimic their natural habitats, often with visitors observing from vehicles.

These terms are sometimes used interchangeably, depending on the specific focus and setup of the facility.
