That's not entirely accurate. The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, as traditionally listed, include two that were built by the Greeks, not three. Here's a correct list:

1. The Great Pyramid of Giza (Egypt) – Not Greek
2. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon (Present-day Iraq) – Not Greek
3. The Statue of Zeus at Olympia (Greece) – Greek
4. The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus (Greece) – Greek
5. The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus (Present-day Turkey) – Built for a Greek Satrap
6. The Colossus of Rhodes (Greece) – Greek
7. The Lighthouse of Alexandria (Egypt) – Built by the Ptolemies, who were Greek

So actually, four of the Seven Wonders were built by or for Greeks or in Greek territories. However, some of these were built in what are now modern-day Turkey and Egypt, but they were within the Greek sphere of influence or built by Greek architects.
