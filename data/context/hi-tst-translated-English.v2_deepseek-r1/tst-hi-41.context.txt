Duralumin, also known as duraluminum, is a type of aluminum alloy. It is primarily composed of aluminum (Al) and copper (Cu) as the main alloying elements, with smaller amounts of other metals. A common composition includes around 94% aluminum, 4% copper, 1% magnesium (Mg), and 1% manganese (Mn). These additives enhance the alloy's strength, durability, and resistance to corrosion. Duralumin is widely used in aircraft structures and other applications where high strength-to-weight ratio and resistance to fatigue are crucial.
