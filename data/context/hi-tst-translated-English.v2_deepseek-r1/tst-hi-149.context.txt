Baseball was first played in the United States. Specifically, the modern game originated in Cooperstown, New York, where Abner Doubleday supposedly invented it in 1839. However, this claim is often disputed, and many historians argue that baseball evolved from various bat-and-ball games that were popular in the mid-19th century in the northeastern United States. Regardless, the United States is widely recognized as the birthplace of baseball.
