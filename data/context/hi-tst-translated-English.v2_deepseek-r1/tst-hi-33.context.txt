When charged particles are accelerated perpendicular to their path, they produce **electromagnetic radiation**. This type of radiation is often referred to as **cyclotron radiation** or **centripetal radiation**. The acceleration causes the charged particles to change their direction, leading to the emission of electromagnetic waves. This phenomenon is commonly observed in scenarios such as charged particles moving in magnetic fields or in circular paths, like in cyclotrons or synchrotrons.
