The Kunar River is approximately 480 kilometers (300 miles) long. It originates in the Hindu Kush mountains of eastern Afghanistan and flows southeastward, eventually crossing into northwestern Pakistan. In Pakistan, it joins the Peshawar Valley before merging with the Kabul River. The Kunar River plays a significant role in the hydrology and ecosystem of both countries.
