Selena Quintanilla-PÃ©rez, known professionally as Selena, was a Mexican-American singer, songwriter, and fashion designer. She is often called the "Queen of Tejano music."

Selena died on March 31, 1995, at the age of 23. She was shot and killed by Yolanda Saldivar, who was her friend, fan club president, and the manager of her boutiques. Selena had become suspicious of Saldivar's management of her finances and decided to terminate her employment. On March 31, 1995, Saldivar lured Selena to a motel in Corpus Christi, Texas, under the pretense of handling a business matter. During their meeting, Saldivar shot Selena once in the back as she tried to leave. Selena suffered severe bleeding and was pronounced dead at the hospital shortly after arrival.

Saldivar was later convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. Selena's death shocked her fans and the music industry, and she remains a celebrated and beloved figure in Latinx culture.
