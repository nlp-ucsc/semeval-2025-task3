The year 1276 is not a leap year under the Gregorian calendar, which is the most widely used calendar in the world today. In the Gregorian calendar, a year is a leap year if:

1. It is divisible by 4, but
2. Not divisible by 100, unless
3. It is also divisible by 400.

Since 1276 is divisible by 4 (1276 รท 4 = 319), it would be a leap year under the Julian calendar, which was in use before the Gregorian calendar. However, the Gregorian calendar was not introduced until 1582, so for the year 1276, the leap year rules of the Julian calendar would apply. Therefore, under the Julian calendar, 1276 would be a leap year.

If you are using a different calendar system, the determination might vary, but under the Julian and Gregorian calendars, 1276 is not a leap year in the modern Gregorian system but was considered a leap year under the Julian system.
