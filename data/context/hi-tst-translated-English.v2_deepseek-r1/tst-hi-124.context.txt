The Munich Agreement was concluded on September 30, 1938. It was a settlement reached between Germany, Italy, France, and the United Kingdom that allowed Nazi Germany to annex the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia without facing military intervention from the Western powers. This agreement is often seen as an example of appeasement policy towards Nazi Germany and is associated with the eventual outbreak of World War II.
