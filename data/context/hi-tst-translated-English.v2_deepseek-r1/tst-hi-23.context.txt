The chemical compound used by German submarines as a sonar decoy during World War II was **Ferroxene**. 

Ferroxene is a mixture of very fine iron and carbon particles. When deployed in the water, these particles form a cloud that scatters and absorbs sound waves, thereby creating a decoy or "bubble" effect. This interfered with the sonar (Sound Navigation and Ranging) technology used by Allied forces to detect and track submarines. By releasing Ferroxene, German U-boats could create false targets or obscure their actual position, making it more difficult for enemies to target them effectively.

The use of such decoys was part of the broader cat-and-mouse technological race during the Battle of the Atlantic, as both sides sought to improve their submarine detection and evasion techniques.
