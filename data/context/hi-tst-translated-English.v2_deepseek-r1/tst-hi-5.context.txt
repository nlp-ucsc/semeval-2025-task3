The first American woman appointed in the Air Force was Julia Ann Hambleton, who became the first female physician and surgeon in the U.S. Army in 1775. However, the U.S. Air Force as a separate branch was established in 1947. The first women to serve in the U.S. Air Force were in 1948 with the establishment of the Women's Medical Specialist Corps. The integration of women into the regular Air Force occurred with the passage of the Women's Armed Services Integration Act of 1948, allowing women to serve in the Air Force with the same rank and privileges as men. The first women were sworn into the Air Force in 1948.
