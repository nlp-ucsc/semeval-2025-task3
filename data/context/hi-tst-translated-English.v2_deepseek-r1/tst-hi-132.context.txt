The term "Magi" is historically associated with the Zoroastrian priesthood. In Zoroastrianism, the Magi were a class of priests who played a significant role in religious rituals, ceremonies, and the interpretation of sacred texts. They were considered the spiritual and scholarly leaders of the community, responsible for maintaining and passing down the teachings of the prophet Zoroaster.

The Magi were also known for their knowledge of astrology, medicine, and other sciences, which were highly valued in ancient times. Their reputation as wise men and scholars spread beyond the Zoroastrian community, and the term "Magi" has since been used more broadly to refer to wise men or magicians in various cultural contexts, as seen in the biblical account of the Three Wise Men visiting the baby Jesus.

In summary, the Zoroastrian religion referred to its priests as Magi, highlighting their important role in both religious and intellectual spheres.
