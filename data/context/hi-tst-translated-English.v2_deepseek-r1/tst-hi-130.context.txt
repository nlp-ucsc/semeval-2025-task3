This is a very specific question regarding the development of directional sense in primitive hunter-gatherer children in the Republic of Congo. Unfortunately, I don't have specific studies or data at hand that pinpoint the exact age at which their sense of direction develops. The development of spatial awareness and directional sense can vary widely based on cultural practices, environmental factors, and individual differences in cognitive development. 

Research into similar populations, such as other indigenous groups, suggests that spatial skills often begin developing early in childhood, as children start to accompany adults on gathering and hunting trips, learning navigation through observation and practice. However, without specific studies on the Republic of Congo's hunter-gatherers, it's challenging to provide an exact age range. If you're looking for detailed information, I recommend consulting anthropological studies or developmental psychology research focused on this region or similar cultures.
