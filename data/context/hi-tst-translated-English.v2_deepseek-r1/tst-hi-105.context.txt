Good question! In Arabic, when addressing international diplomacy or important political positions, instead of "honorable," several terms are used to convey respect and formality. Here are some common ones:

1. **Посол (Safir)**: This refers to an ambassador and is often used in diplomatic contexts to address or refer to high-ranking officials.

2. **临时 (Mumathal)**: This means "representative" and is used to denote someone representing a country or organization in official capacities.

3. **尊敬的 (Mu'azzam)**: This translates to "honorable" or "esteemed" and is used to show respect towards someone in a high political or diplomatic position.

4. **阁下 (Sada)**: A more general term meaning "Your Excellency," which is widely used in formal and diplomatic correspondence.

5. **绅士/淑女 (Hadrat al-Safir)**: Literally "His/Her Excellency the Ambassador," used specifically for ambassadors.

These terms are chosen to reflect the level of formality and respect required in international diplomacy and political discourse.
