Sepia ink is produced by **sepia officinalis**, commonly known as the **common cuttlefish**. These marine animals are actually **cephalopods**, closely related to squid and octopuses, rather than fish. They release a dark, ink-like liquid as a defense mechanism to confuse predators and aid in their escape. This ink is often used as a natural dye and in culinary dishes, such as in **sepia toning** in photography and in recipes like **black rice** or **paella**.
