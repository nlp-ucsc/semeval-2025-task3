According to Goldberg and Waage's formulation of the law of mass action, the rate of a chemical reaction is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants, each raised to a power equal to their stoichiometric coefficient in the balanced chemical equation. This law provides the foundation for the rate laws used in chemical kinetics to describe how reaction rates depend on reactant concentrations.
