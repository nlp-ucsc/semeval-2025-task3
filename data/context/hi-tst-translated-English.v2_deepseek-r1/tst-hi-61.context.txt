The Salafi Sunni community, which adheres to the teachings of the Salaf (the first three generations of Muslims including the Prophet Muhammad, his companions, and their followers), generally does not designate a single individual as their overall leader or Imam in the formal sense. Instead, they emphasize adherence to the original teachings of Islam as understood by the Salaf. However, they follow sponsoring scholars and influential figures within the Salafi movement, such as Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, for guidance. Therefore, they do not recognize a specific living Imam but instead derive their understanding from classical Islamic scholarship.
