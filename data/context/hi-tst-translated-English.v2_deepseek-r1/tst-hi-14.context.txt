The FNAC stands for Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology. It's a diagnostic procedure used to examine lumps or masses, especially those that are small or unclear. A thin needle is inserted into the suspicious area, and a sample of cells is aspirated for examination under a microscope to determine if the cells are benign or malignant.
