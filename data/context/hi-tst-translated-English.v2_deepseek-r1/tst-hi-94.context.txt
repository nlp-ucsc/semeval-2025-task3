There are three main types of acute coronary syndrome (ACS):

1. **ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI):** 
   - Characterized by a significant elevation of the ST segment on an electrocardiogram (ECG), indicating a complete blockage of a coronary artery. This type of ACS is the most severe and requires immediate treatment, often with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or thrombolytic therapy.

2. **Non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI):** 
   - In this type, the ST segment is either depressed and/or inverted on the ECG, but there is no significant elevation. It indicates a partial blockage of a coronary artery. Treatment typically involves antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulants, and possibly PCI.

3. **Unstable Angina (UA):** 
   - This is the mildest form of ACS and occurs when the blood flow to the heart is suddenly reduced, but there is no evidence of myocardial necrosis (no cardiac biomarkers like troponin are elevated). It is characterized by worsening chest pain or pain at rest. Management includes medical therapy such as aspirin, nitrates, beta-blockers, and possibly PCI.

Understanding these types is crucial for guiding appropriate and timely treatment. Each type has different clinical presentations, diagnostic criteria, and management strategies.
