Abel Tasman, the Dutch maritime explorer, landed on the soil of New Zealand in the year 1642. This was during his voyage of discovery in the service of the Dutch East India Company. He is notable for being the first European to sight New Zealand, although he initially thought he had reached a southern part of South America. Tasman anchored in Golden Bay, near the northern tip of the South Island, and his encounter with the indigenous MƒÅori people was unfortunately marked by conflict. Tasman's explorations contributed significantly to the mapping of the Pacific region during the Age of Sail.
