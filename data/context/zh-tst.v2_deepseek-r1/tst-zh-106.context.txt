Okay, I see the user is asking about the municipalities in the West Athens regional unit in Greece. Let me recall the information. West Athens is part of the Athens regional district, which was established after the Kallikratis plan in 2011. 

So, I think it consists of several municipalities. Let me list them one by one. First, there's Egaleo, which is also known as Aegaleo or Egaleo. Then, there's Aspropyrgos, which is an industrial area. Next, I remember there's Chaidari, which is a bit more residential. 

Wait, are there more? Yes, there's also Petroupoli, which is known for its cultural activities. Then, there's Ilion, also known as Nea Liosia, and finally, Agioi Anargyroi-Kamatero, which is a combined municipality. 

Let me make sure I have all six. So, listing them in order: Egaleo, Aspropyrgos, Chaidari, Petroupoli, Ilion, and Agioi Anargyroi-Kamatero. That makes six municipalities in total. 

I should present them in a clear list, maybe bullet points for readability. The user might need this information for travel, research, or administrative purposes, so accuracy is important. I think that's all; I don't recall any other municipalities in West Athens. Alright, I’ll format the response clearly.
