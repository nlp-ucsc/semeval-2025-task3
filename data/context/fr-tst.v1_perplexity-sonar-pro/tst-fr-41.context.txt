Lil Dagover discovered cinema through her first marriage to actor Fritz Daghofer in 1917. Specifically:

Dagover married Fritz Daghofer in 1917, when she was around 30 years old and he was 25 years her senior[1][3]. Fritz Daghofer introduced her to several notable film directors of the time, including Robert Wiene and Fritz Lang[1][4]. 

This introduction to prominent directors in the German film industry launched Dagover's acting career. Though she had made her screen debut in 1913 in a film by Louis Held[1], it was her marriage to Daghofer that truly opened doors for her in the cinema world.

The marriage was short-lived, ending in divorce in 1919[3][4]. However, in those two years, Dagover made important connections that kickstarted her prolific career in German silent films. Notably, Fritz Lang cast her in the 1919 film "Harakiri," which proved to be Dagover's breakout role[1][4].

In the same year as her divorce, 1919, she appeared in Robert Wiene's expressionist classic "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"[1][3][4]. This film, along with several others directed by Fritz Lang in the early 1920s, cemented Dagover's status as one of the most popular and recognized film actresses in the Weimar Republic[1][4].
